urgently from upstairs in our home. i went up to meet her standing on the balcony of the top floor bedroom looking out and up into the night sky. she pointed off to the south below the bright moon that was there then gestured\r\nsomewhere into the usual los angeles atmospheric murk that obscures most stars e.T.C and said \"look ..Up there..Keep watching...Something is blinking...Then it will suddenly flash somewhere just below it like a camera flash after the 'other' thing blinks!\"\r\nshe seems disturbed by whatever it was she was seeing. i followed her hands direction and peered into the night sky. within less than a minute i also observed what she was describing.At about an angle of 35 degrees or so off the horizon..Halfway between the moon's height in the sky and the hollywood hills barely visible to the south...And just left of the moon as viewed from our vantage point...There was a sudden 'twinkling' of light. this i would describe as lasting perhaps a second or more and at first i took to be an aircraft's navigational lights. upon further observation (later as it repeated this same action) i noticed the light/lights were not moving. the light/lights seemed very far off and high.Barely visible next to the nearest bright star it also appeared to be a tiny 'cluster' of lights and to me had various colors in those tiny lights ranging from reds to blue's and white...Possibly more.There seemed to be a 'set pattern' to the blinks as it occurred once again leading me to suspect it was an aircraft.It still did not move. the light'lights would then just as suddenly disappear.Then after these lights would twinkle...Just as my girlfriend predicted, the other sudden 'flash' of light (possibly 5-10 degrees lower in the sky and somewhat close to the original object) would occur. it's light was exactly as described...A sudden bright white flash brighter than any of the brightest stars (much so) and oddly like a 'star filter' was being used as per movies often use. it also lasted momentarily longer than a camera flash. this 'twinkle..Then flash' repeated itself perhaps three times while i observed it and perhaps the same when my girlfriend observed it. this lasted possibly 15 minutes or so in total then no more...We thought we could barley see the 'twinkle' cluster for an amount of time after but then lost it completely..After another 10 minutes or more and went back inside.\r\nit did not appear to move position the whole time.\r\ni pondered later whether it truly was just a staionary arcraft of some sort but could not fathom what the accompanying much lower 'flash' light might have been.\r\n\r\n

very smoothly. enough for me to have been looking at it during the red stoplight and not lost it from sight. it was a clear morning so i know it wasn’t anything else. and i know what a plane shape is like but this didn’t have any wings jutting out or a tail. it was just a smooth metallic triangle with lights on the bottom. i wasn't afraid, felt pretty calm, intrigued when looking at the object. i

the porch, with the leash in my hand, i immediately saw an object flying very low in the sky coming towards us. i first remember thinking that it was a plane flying very very low, until i saw the pattern of  bright white lights at the bottom: a row of 2 or 3 and just above that another, a bit longer row of lights, maybe 6 or 7. on the belly of the object. i also realized that it was not making noise as a plane would, even a plane flying low beginning to land. it was a barely audible pulsating hum. it was also approaching faster than a plane flying that low would be, faster than a plane flying overhead in a landing pattern would be, but slow enough to give me time to really look at it.\r\n\r\ni'm a retired investigator and it's natural for me to immediately take in details quickly, to notice things and that instinct kicked in, even though i'd realized what this could be, even though i was standing there, totally in awe. and - the fact that i have a partially photographic memory helped too.\r\n\r\nas i reached the end of the porch, still looking up, our solar powered motion sensor light came on behind us, illuminating me from the back. about a second later, the object, which was nearly overhead and which i could almost see the outlines of, suddenly slowed down, almost stopping, hesitated, it looked like it may have wobbled - and i remember thinking it was almost as if it - whoever was flying it, saw the porch-light come on and saw me standing there, illuminated by it, mesmerized. there are not many lights on that early in our neighborhood, our porch-light is a very bright white light and would stand out, and they were flying low enough i guess it was possible that whoever it was did see me.\r\n\r\nafter hesitating for a moment, the object made a slight turn, still nw but more to the west and it completed the turn much more quickly than a plane would have. also, by this time, i could see more of an outline of the object and could see it was definitely not a plane - it was much much shorter in length and width. the white lights which i'd noticed initially were located at the on the bottom of the object - on its \"belly\" \r\n\r\nthere is a gas station about a block away towards the northwest, which has so many lights so bright a plane could land, and as it made the slight turn, it was almost directly overhead and i could see more of the outline and it looked as if it were either a light color, or was made of some reflective material that was reflecting the bright lights of the gas station, or possibly illuminated by lights on tops of it i could not see, if it was actually glowing faintly - and i could see it was definitely not a plane. there was no wings, no tail. it looked almost \"shuttle like\", not as in our space shuttle. more of a wedge shape - but definitely not flat - it looked as if the objects height may have been about 1/3 of the body length. i could not see if there were windows. \r\n\r\nafter it passed, i saw the back, and there were 3 pale orange/yellow, glowing and much much larger round lights, in a triangular shape, they actually looked more like the bottom of a rocket (where there are emissions) - but there were none - instead, they glowed. it definitely looked as if whatever it was was being propelled by whatever those orange lights were, like they were a form of propulsion - only with no emission. \r\n\r\nas it approached the trees in the distance, it looked as if it may have shifted direction again, still northwest, but more north than northwest. then, once it passed the trees it was out of my line of sight. \r\n\r\nthat was, amazingly.......Cool! i have experienced sightings before, before this just happened, over 30 years ago, several friends and i sitting on a bluff overlooking peoria near midnight watched in awe as what was obviously a fairly sizable flying object, both hovered and darted about in the sky. that object had a dark outline and had many lights, but because it was a distance away, it was just a bit bigger than a dime in our line of vision. we watched it for a good 5 minutes, and it suddenly zipped away. before this, that was my best experience. this object was just a bit bigger than a golf ball in my line of vision as it passed overhead.  this......Was awesome! and that's how i was feeling as it hesitated as they saw me standing there, heck, i wanted to invite them in for coffee! \r\n\r\ni do not carry my phone outside with me when i take the dogs out - am afraid they will suddenly dart towards a critter and with me holding the leash, would drop my phone, but i am regretting not having it with me - i could have taken quite a few pictures at the speed in which it was traveling. i am going to find a way to carry it with me from now on....\r\n
