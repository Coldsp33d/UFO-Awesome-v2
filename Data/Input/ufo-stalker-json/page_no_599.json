Range","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\r\nit was 8:45pm, july-7-1997 white sands missile range.\r\n     i was leaving work and heading west on nike ave.  i had just reached the horse shoe curve and noticed in the distant mountains an orange ball of light which i thought might be a fire burning two-thirds the way up the mountain side.  there were fires in that same place the year before.  the smoke of those fires invaded main post.  as i continued to drive west on nike ave., i noticed that this was not a fire but something that was fiery orange in color and was floating down the mountain.  when the object was about half way down the mountain it headed north towards main post.  i continued to drive west on nike ave., towards main post.  the object then changed from orange to a luminous white.  the object then headed in my direction and stopped half way down nike ave.  it stayed illuminated all the way from the mountain to the halfway point of nike ave.  the light intensity stayed the same too.  \r\n     the object was about 3 to 4 car lengths away from me, about a stone throw. i pulled over onto the shoulder of the road and stopped my car.  the object started to descend and i thought it was going to land but it did not.  it came within about seven feet of the ground and stopped in the air.   i waited to see dust kick up around it but there was none.  it looked like the sphere that carried the “good witch” in the “wizard of oz” movie.  it was a perfect sphere in its shape approximately 9 to 12 feet in diameter.\r\n     this object just stopped in the air and didn’t float around or wobble but stayed in one place.  any other aircraft would wobble a little to compensate for air currents.  there was no sound coming from this object like motors which other aircraft do produce.  and there was no wind blowing that night.\r\n    the object was so luminous that it was like looking right into a 100 watt light bulb at night and seeing nothing but the light.  if someone was inside the object they may have been blinded.  \r\n     i parked my car on the opposite side of the road shoulder facing in the direction of the object.  i then saw the object or light shut off.  i waited a moment and the object turned back on again.   i thought if there was any intelligence on board this thing it might understand mathematics.  so i turned my headlights off and then blinked the headlights once, twice, and three times, then twice, then once again.  this would show addition and subtraction in its simplest form.  \r\n     now the object started to move in the direction from which it came.  it followed the same flight path back the same way it had come, as though it was following a programmed flight course.  i continued to drive west on nike ave.  keeping an eye on it until it went over the mountain, heading towards las cruces.\r\n     this thing flew faster than i was driving which was 55 mph.   i headed home going north on owen road which leads to highway 70.  as i clover leafed around to get on highway 70, i was now facing south and looking at the mountains where the object flew over.  i could see two smaller bright lights coming over the mountain and they were together.  it looked like headlights of a car flying over the mountain heading north.  the lights flying parallel to each other split apart, one going west and the other going east and both turned back to the mountain they just come over to go back over it again.  at this time i noticed a third light, it was a red blinking light hovering beyond the back side of the mountain, not moving.  when all three lights met together they disappeared behind the mountain.  after that, i did not see anything else.  i continued to go home.\r\nto this day i don’t know what i saw.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

ghost. my daughter and myself have many experiences with this.  but ghost do not scare me like the ufo happenings do...Its almost like we can manage or protect ourselves from ghost, but with this other, you have no control..I have had bright orbs invade my house, scan my daughter and show up outside my windows and jet off so fast...From my first encounter i recall at 14, i knew there was not a lot of people to talk too about this..My most 2 recent things happened this year 2015...I seen a small craft over my house about 20 ft in the air..I studied it for the few seconds while it was there, i was not scared at all..  i looked online at so many photos of ufo until i found a pic of the one i had just seen, that type was last seen in 1952. there was no smoke, lights nothing dramatic about this craft. it was just there and then gone. somehow i felt they didn't even notice me sitting in a chair almost under them..The most troubling account happened this year. i live a rural area of oklahoma..I had been taking care of dogs left at a house,up the road from my house. i was feeding them everyday after work..Weather was cold, i bought blankets and put in the dog houses..I felt someone had been helping my with keeping the blankets in the dog house and such, i looked across the street and seen a house, i just thought someone bought the property and moved in with a prefab/mobile home. i thought maybe these people are helping which will be great!! i was going to ask them and introduce myself,but didn't look like anyone was home, so i didn't go, the next day or two, i see the house again, looks like they are all at work so i'd go another time and ask if they have been helping with the dogs. about the 4th time, i seen they were home, lights on, trucks in the driveway..So i decide to go to ask them about the dogs,but i can not find their driveway entrance, i go the  next guys property over and ask, how do i get into their driveway,(the new people) he didn't know anything about it..I went on home..Im telling my boyfriend in text at least 3 times on different days, that i think the people that live across the road are helping, finally he asked...'what house are you talking about? and i said, the new one right across the road, its white with black shutters and they drive a white pickup..He did not recall seeing a new house there, over the weekend..I kept saying well its there now, no big deal...Well when he came for the next weekend, we went up to feed the dogs and he said, 'wheres the house you kept texting about?' when i looked up to point it out, it wasn't there..I even had him walk up the hill and check..I seen this house on several different occasions, before work, after work..I know what i saw, i can describe it in detail..But its not there now..I was so shaken up and bothered by this. i drove to the neighbors house with my boyfriend to ask him, if i had came there last week to ask him about how to get into the driveway of the new house, he said yes, you came here and asked..Ghost, orbs, ufo's have not shaken me up as bad as that event this year..I am a 55 yr old female, i do not drink, no drugs.I was witnessing something in a different reality, several times that is not showing up now..I started to cry and get very upset when he said, there is no house there..And yet i know all the details of that house, porch lighting, wooded stairs and could see people moving inside like getting ready to settle down for night after a day at work..","distance":"20 Feet or

bright pulse of white light to the west of the moon.  first impression was a possible small meteor or iridium flare from a satellite.  about 10-15 seconds later, the flash occurred again slightly more east of the first.  continuing to watch, the flash occurred every 10-15 seconds with the movement from west to east for the first 2 minutes or so and was not consistent between each sighting.  further observation showed the light pulse change from an east to a more southern path.  while watching, a passenger airline passed from west to east directly in the path of the object which was much higher

a ufo sighting the previous year. it was late at night and he was sub soiling a field. an glowing orb appeared at speed and stopped about 20ft above the tractor. he estimated it to be about 3ft in diameter. it hovered above him for several seconds before flying off at speed the way it had come. \r\n\r\ni took this as a joke to wind me up as i was working till 3-4 in the mornings, ploughing. a few days later i was doing just that when, at about 1am, i saw some lights dashing around the sky to the north. my immediate thoughts where of the plough lights reflecting around the cab, as it was very similar. there was mass' of muck flies flying around these lamps leaving little light trails behind them. the light in the shy gave a similar appearance. i stopped and turned all the lights out. they where still there. then i looked behind me to see if it was a house light, but there was just darkness. now i was getting curious. i opened the sunroof and stuck my head out for a good uninterrupted line of sight. this was no reflection. the main light (holding your arm out straight with a uk penny to give you a size comparison) was surrounded by a mass of much smaller lights that circled in a flitting motion around its girth. every now and then one of them would disappear into the distance and return from that direction 15 seconds or so later. i watched for about ten minutes in which time the smaller light went off many times. all at once the small lights merged with the larger orb, and a few seconds later went vertically at huge speed. it was like watching a star trek space ship going to warp speed from stand still. it was truly amazing.\r\n\r\nthe following morning i told a colleague about it. he suggested quizzing the old boy in more detail. a few minutes later he pulled into the yard. we went straight up to him and asked him to tell us again what he had seen, which he did. i then asked him if there had been anything else in the sky. \"yes, there was\". this was like getting blood from a stone. we did not want to put words or ideas into his head so asked if it was an aircraft. \"no it was the mother ship and all the other little lights.\" he then described the mother ship in much greater detail. he said it was way bigger than the moon and guessed it to be more than 100 yards in diameter with 20 - 30 smaller lights buzzing backwards and forwards. \r\n\r\nthere was a series on the tv. seaquest dsv. on this series they had small orbs, with sensors, around the sub which they called \"whiskers\". that is what i would call the smaller lights. they gave the impression that they were gathering readings and information. the old boy had seen this at much closer distance and, where i didn't feel threatened, he was terrified. he still did night shifts but always had the tractor doors locked.

center light offset, but the lights stayed the same distance apart from each other and flew a steady path from north to south not blinking one time like nothing i've seen before. a plane was flying about half a mile above it from east to west with obvious red and blue blinking lights.I watched this for about 45 seconds to a minute until it went out of view over a tree line. when i first seen it i was excited i suppose, i first started thinking though that maybe it was military, but the more i thought about it i wasnt so sure. i came back inside and told my wife. the next day some friends suggested could they have been chinese lanterns. i instantly say no cause they would have changed spacing and flickered.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

heard in the field across our street coyotes had started to feed the kits a very late pack of them when we heard several like howls from something unknown then they began to hoot at each other. and then all hell broke out it seemed that whatever was howling attacked the coyotes and was tearing them apart it was very very loud and terrifying to listen to.After it ended my neighbor came out and asked us what the hell it was we said we had no idea what just attacked the coyotes we went into the woods to see but had a terrible fear and went into our home .The next evening it was raining alot and i had several friends over and told them of what we heard so we all went outside to tell n show them about where it happened and in the field was red glowing eyes staring rite at us i hit them with a laser pointer and then from behind the first being four then six more stepped out from behind it and then they were like jumping and frolicking about each other but at all time the first one stayed staring at us when i noticed that 2 on each side started walking to toe side of the field and i said they are hunting us and we're trying to gain our flanks and we ran into our home .We waited several hours but all through the night they were there staring at my house. the next day they were gone we could not find footprints which was crazy as it rained all night when we measured to the height of the red eyes they were at about ten feet tall. after that i have had several strange events and floating strong orbs in the sky above my home one night me my son and a friend witnessed one of the flashing lighted crafts land in the mtn range just above my home . i have been unable to shake the fear and uneasy feelings after these events my dogs have several times run into my home and
