26, 2017\r\n\r\nat dusk i was standing on my deck and looking up.  i noticed what i assumed to be a satellite (small star size).  as it flew from the west towards the east, i had the thought in my mind of asking it to come back.  i was shocked when it actually made a sharp turn and came back toward the west.  it was very faint but i didn't take my eyes off of it and grabbed my cell phone.  i followed the object with my camera as it descended heading north.   it then quickly ascended up towards the northwest and i was afraid i would lose sight of it because of my roof line.  just then a passenger jet appeared above my house heading southeast right from the direction where the object had just quickly darted to.  \r\n\r\nwhen i played the video back, i couldn't catch sight of it and as the months have gone on i just put it near the back of my mind thinking i had just imagined it.  \r\n\r\nlast evening i decided to look at the video again, painstakingly moving through the video frame by frame telling myself that i wasn't crazy.  i quickly realized i had captured more than my naked eye had seen.  i don't know of any video / photography experts who could analyze what is on the video but i feel this is an urgent matter as there was air traffic that seemed to have objects swarming it.  \r\n\r\nthese are only a few of the screen grabs from the video and i've made exposure adjustments to  a couple of them to try to clearly see the objects.  there are so many of these objects that it's impossible to count or keep track of where they dart off to next.  i realize cell phone cameras don't take the best quality photos but there must be a way to make these photos clearer.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

door and down the sidewalk to the parking lot. its a good time to observe the weather, look at the stars, and do alone time thinking. i was a little stressed out with work and everything, and as i stood there i noticed a little thin cloud leave a larger one off in the distance, maybe fifteen miles away, and was the only one until i saw the little one drop down. i just stood there watching, and the little cloud was heading towards me from the south, until it reached the car ports on the other side of the parking lot. the side of the parking lot i was on was just one row of cars, none in front of me at the end of the sidewalk, and on the other side were car ports, one row on my side and people had to park in the carports on the other side. the car ports were in two segments, one for the two building on my side, and one for the other two building on my left, and the main driveway from the street cam up between the two side, so the carports on the other side had this big gap between them. i stood at the end of the sidewalk nearest the main driveway, and the cloud rested in place between the two carports, and even overlapped both carports. i just thought it interesting because i had never seen anything like that before, and what would cause that? i struggled in my mind at what i was looking at, trying to figure it out, until the shape came to me, it being very large i couldn't make it out, and then i saw it, it kind of reminded me of the original lost in space ship they traveled in, except there was no light on the top, and no lights on the bottom to suggest by any means of the source it flew by, it was just silent. the ship had two floors, and there were four square windows, two on the top, and two on the bottom, and there were seven figures all looking out the window on the bottom left, all observing me, with their round heads. the one thing that really stood out, were there round heads, and the ship was cloaked in a mist, outlining the ship and windows, and only made it fuzzy, but didn't hid what it was or who was inside. it would have been easy to miss, even if there were other people. i knew they had come for me, and i knew enough of how they communicated because of watching things like this, but at the time, i had not yet seen the barney and betty video, i didn't find that one for over a year after this. the ship and its crew moved off very slow to my left, and faded more and more into the dark until i couldn't see it any longer. during the five minutes i observed the ship, it remained the same, the hole time, and was fuzzy. it reminded me of a test, could i see them.","distance":"101-500

the report is in the archives and is pinned on the site , should you require referencing. i am of genuine peaceful intent , and an advocate for all of us beings of positive intent to collectively begin embracing each other , without the \" false media agenda \" making all extraterrestrials out to be a negative threat. i am all for disclosure and no one , on any level , needs to feel any shame , or judgement when reporting the anomalies - ufo - craft - odd lights etc , as they are very much a part of every day life and always part of our every day existence. report everything. just dont false report or exaggerate out of proportion as all you are doing is polluting your report and clouding the waters of clarity in the over all collective results of this very important and very relevant part and fact of every second of your my and our existence. these beings / craft / light form / \" ufo \" etc do not discriminate and everyone from past royal related family members to the homeless man on the street has given official police statements at one time or another about exactly what they saw they experienced. dont give a toss what anyone may think about you or your report , and do not buy into the \" conspiracy theorist \" label or worry about being thought of as \" one of those weird ufo conspiracy theorists \". that is what they want. that is why the label was created to \" discredit \" and \" belittle \" those who speak up and speak out who are very very much just as bright , intelligent , switched on , aware individuals who have nothing to do with \" conspiracy \". they just simply have the strength to communicate what they saw / experienced for perhaps the benefit of us all.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
