(think of a target store parking lot way after it's closed but all lights are on).\r\n\r\ni'm not sure if the object appeared or just approached me but out of nowhere i see 3 glowing red lights in the shape of a triangle flying directly towards me but not at me if you get what i mean.\r\nat the moment i realized what i was seeing (a ufo) i was so excited i jumped up (slowly) and took a couple of steps off the porch and stepped onto the sidewalk to get a better look.\r\nthen, i immediately noticed 2 to 4 dozen small \"tinker bell\" sized (and equal in brightness) shaped orbs randomly rotating in no specific order around the outside of the triangle aircraft. and as the object approached closer i also noticed there was no exhaust or sound of propulsion but i could hear the tinker bell orbs that enclosed the triangle sound like streaks and pops of electricity. also, the triangle aircraft seemed to glide and not fly. as it flew directly over me and i realized my mouth was wide open in awe, i quickly ran back to the house about ten feet away and began pounding on a very large front window to get my best friends attention inside. my friend came out moments later like wtf dude? i replied that i just saw a ufo that flew towards me and i lost sight of it behind the house. he laughed at me and told everyone inside that i just saw a ufo and they all laughed too. one friend believed me and we immediately ran to the backyard to see where it went but the sky was empty by then, maybe 2-3 minutes later.\r\n\r\n i don't think this as \"aliens\" but more military tech that was alien like. \r\nit started at a 45 degree angle relative to my view, directly above the department store and flew directly over me to behind the house where my view became obstructed by trees and houses. one thing i noticed that was strange as well was the fact that one of the only two cars in the empty parking lot was a black suv that i swear i could see an alfred hitchcock like silhouette of a person. i assumed it was abandoned but after the object left, the suv soon followed.\r\n\r\ni became very intrigued in what i saw and began searching youtube for similar sightings. what i soon learned is that the object i may have saw could have been the us gov't astra tr-3b. however in every captured video, only a few show 3 red lights, almost all have a fourth light in the center that glows and absolutely none of the videos showed evidence of the 2-4 dozen tinker bell like objects that surrounded the object which i saw. i am strongly convinced that what i witnessed was anti-gravity technology being tested. this happened almost 20 years ago so i my dates aren't exact but i do believe this technology is almost elementary by now.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":89386,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.7460907,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01072018-0003","longitude":-84.5912159,"occurred":936057600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1515296109000,"summary":"Triangle object w/ 25 to 50 tinkerbell like white orbs resembling a force field around the craft.","tags":["video","sound","triangle","ufo","lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1515378645364,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":26,"maxtempi":79,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":17,"meantempi":62,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":7,"mintempi":44,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":26,"maxtempi":79,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":17,"meantempi":62,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":7,"mintempi":44,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"48917","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6704,"locationName":"Lansing, Michigan","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:3600"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Logan","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" my husband and i were walking outside our apartments to go do laundry. i saw a bright fiery light coming towards us (north) in the night sky.  it was overcast and this was the only light in the sky.  it almost looks like a helicopter that was on fire that was flying really low.  it got brighter as it came closer.  my husband thought that it was a meteor but it was moving too slow.  it quickly changed directions and started going north east.  then it suddenly just stopped, and hovered in the same spot for about 35 to 45 seconds.  then it went straight up, and just disappeared.  it didn’t make any kind of noise or sound at all.

against railing and talk. on multiple occasions i noticed a light, moving around like a bee/randomly(around 8pm to midnight-depending when we arrived on battlefield.  it caught my attention b/c it was much brighter than a star,&completely quiet-so i didn’t think it was a helicopter or planet or star. it sorta hovered around the same area, always westward upon initial sightings, and slowly might meanderslightly north. although i pointed it out to friends and asked their opinion on what it might be, i was seemingly the only curious person.Frustrating! i had also noticed similar light multiple times when i was alone, too. \r\nso that pretty much it.  i was about 14-20y old when i’d have these sightings—always night, always westward etc always one starlike entity etceverything same.  if i didn’t have eyesight i would never have noticed anything there.\r\niits funny but i don’t remember how or when i’d lose sight of them.  i wish i knew someone else who noticed them too. as far as

la nuit du 24 au 25 dã©cembre. quittant le rã©veillon de noã«l passã© chez ma mã¨re en avignon, je rentrais chez moi ã  lauris.\r\nj'ã©tais en train de conduire  sur la \"route dâ€™avignon\" aux abords de cavaillon, lorsque je vis dans le ciel trois boules orangã©es.\r\nje me suis alors dit: \"tiens qu'est-ce que c'est? ce ne sont pas des ã©toiles c'est bien trop gros!\" a ce moment lã  j'ã©tais ã  2km du point de croisement et les boules ã©taient alignã©es en ligne quasi droite:\r\no  o  o\r\ntout en avanã§ant droit dans leur direction et en excluant complã¨tement les possibilitã©s d'avions, de fusã©es ã©clairantes. les 3 boules se sont dã©placã©es de maniã¨re ã  former un triangle isocã¨les.\r\n  o\r\no   o \r\npuis la distances entre ces trois lumiã¨res s'est agrandi.\r\n    o\r\n\r\n       o\r\no\r\nme rapprochant de plus en plus, une premiã¨re lumiã¨res a disparu d'une maniã¨re particuliã¨re. c'ã©tait comme si la lumiã¨re fondã©e dans le ciel. puis une seconde lumiã¨re a disparue. \r\nil ne restait plus qu'une lumiã¨re stationnaire. \r\nje pouvais la voir, sans ãªtre certaine de sa distance mais je voyais bien  que ce n'ã©tait pas une lanterne chinoises. on peu en apercevoir plusieurs durant cette pã©riode et ã§a n'avait ni les mãªmes dã©placements, ni la mãªme intensitã©. de plus les lanternes ont, ce que j'appelle, un \"battement\" de flamme. \r\nlã  c'ã©tait une lumiã¨re vive et continue.\r\npuis, je suis passã© dessous en voiture. ce qui m'a permit de constater que l'objet ã©tait bien lumineux sur toute la surface de la sphã¨re.\r\nje n'arrivais pas ã  l'expliquer. \r\n\r\nje continuais ã  avancer en voyant la boule dans mon rã©troviseur, puis j'ai bien du regarder la route devant moi. lorsque j'ai regardã© dans le rã©tro de nouveau (quelques seconde aprã¨s), je la perdais simplement de vue.\r\n\r\naujourd'hui je ne sais pas si c'ã©tait pas manque de courage ou obnubilã© par mes questions au point de continuer, mais je regrette de ne pas m'ãªtre arrãªtã©. ã‡a bougeait tellement devant moi, que j'ã©tais concentrã©e sur le sens de cette apparition. \r\n\r\nj'ai bien mis 5 min avant de rã©aliser complã¨tement que je ne pouvais vraiment pas l'expliquer. pour moi c'ã©tait des ovnis dans le sens que je n'ai pu les identifier.\r\n\r\nle lendemain j'en parle ã  ma belle så“ur trã¨s rapidement, qui me dit: \"mon amie **** les a vue aussi !\"\r\nj'ai cherchã© sur internet et vu 2 tã©moignages ressemblant au mien, l'un ã  vedã¨ne, l'autre ã  lâ€™ile-sur-sorgues.\r\naujourd'hui mon frã¨re m'a envoyã© le lien de l'article de la provence

mission to clear a mountain of laundry,not much was done after this ufo passed by.\r\nafter only pressing 1 tee shirt, i was in the process of turning another inside out to continue the ironing

right hand side grabbed my attention.\r\n\r\nhaving had a previous sighting of an orb like object very recently,this was something i quickly recognised and switched my phone to camera mode to capture an image of which i have 3 and was able to record video of the object moving away into cloud cover.\r\nthis object was to my eye an orb of some type,appearing metallic and polished,however,changing shape as it moved through the air,but could this be the result of reflecting clouds on its surface.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared to be moving in a tumbling fashion through the air,as if rolling over and over,rather than travelling steady and on a fixed trajectory.\r\n\r\nit was moving with purpose and considerable momentum,at first appearance as if coming directly across my viewing point from my window,but as my video shows,it was moving away in a westerly direction.\r\nthe video clip shows the object appearing for around 8 seconds before going into the cloud cover.\r\nthroughout the footage the object is tumbling and appears as a darker object rather than as first viewed being bright and metallic.\r\nobject disappeared into cloud cover.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

it...At this point the light travels a bit south for several seconds and then stops...And then the light accends in a very slight east direction and it kept going until i lost sight of the light. the

my phone. as i was recording the first object which was flying out of view, i was absolutely shocked to notice a second object lower in the sky flying behind it. the second object was a doughnut shape. it wobbled as it flew. both objects were black. the second object was much clearer and i could see as it wobbled that there was a hole in the middle. it was shaped exactly like a doughnut. it too had green fluorescent pulses. the second object should have been extremely clear on my camera but when i have watched the footage back, neither object can be seen, however, i noticed on the camera footage that there are 2 other objects moving in the opposite direction at the same height of the first object. these 2 move extremely quickly and are parallel to each other. i did not see these when i was filming.I have sent the footage to a friend who is good with imaging to see if he can pull the objects from the footage. i do not know why they are not apparent in my footage. i have never
