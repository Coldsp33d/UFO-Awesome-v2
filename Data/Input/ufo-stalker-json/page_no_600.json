now everything unexplainable in the sky is probably just a drone.'\r\n\r\nafter the object disappeared behind the buildings across the street and probably landed i went back inside for a moment to get a glass of water and then felt the urge to take one last look outside but the object had not returned.\r\n\r\nthen, right as i was going to retreat back indoors, i glanced straight upwards and just as i did, a large, black/dark grey triangle/boomerang shaped craft passed silently and swiftly directly over my head. it had no running lights but there was enough ambient light pollution to illuminate it from the ground that i was able to clearly make out the shape.\r\n\r\nnow i've been following black triangle stories for decades and i never thought i would see one, let alone right outside of the home in the middle of urban sprawl orange county. ironically, my father had a similar sighting many years ago in new york city except he saw several of these things as opposed to the one i saw.\r\n\r\ni estimate the craft was about the size of a football field, flying between 500-1000ft off the deck and moving at about 200mph, traveling east to west. no lights and no noise but i was able to clearly observe it for about 4 seconds.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

inside, who was stubbornly at the curb of street. \r\n\r\ni was facing east and a bright white object moving across the sky appeared from the east horizon. almost 90 degrees from where i stood. i watched it move across the sky for about 8 seconds until it disappeared over the west horizon. it was a steady bright white, i could not recognize any shape to the object, but it remained as a large twinkle. yet, it was not twinkling, there was no pulsating light, just a steady bright light. \r\n\r\nit had no changes in size or color, and an unchanging straight line pace. at first sight i expected it was part of the orionids meteor shower happening tonight, but it was larger than the usual meteors i see during showers. it had no tail, or trail, it moved a little less fast than a meteor. actually i'm not sure about speed in that aspect, because i've seen fast and slow meteors, and large and small meteors. this was different, it was something i've never seen before.\r\n\r\nwhile watching, i kept my eyes fixed on it, i felt in awe, comfortable, and i wanted to follow it. my cat did not care, he plopped into the grass, rolled around a bit, walked around, nothing unusual. after sighting it, i looked up to the north to spot an airplane. the previous light object i saw didn't look like an airplane, i couldn't make out it's shape, it seemed pretty far, larger,  and moved faster than any airplane i've ever seen at very long distance. \r\n\r\ni have no footage, or photos, and my cell phone was in the house during the experience. i plan on heading out later to see some of the meteor shower and would find it interesting to search online if anyone else had also witnessed this light object in the sky.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

will briefly observe the night sky as the area i live offers a near horizon to horizon view. right in the middle of the big dipper was a bright light. it was obviously out of place from what i would normally see. the light was stationary for about 20 seconds. then to the northeast a second light caught my attention as it flashed very brightly toward the southwest. at this time the 1st object began to slowly move in the direction of the 2nd object. when i looked back toward the northeast i could no longer see the 2nd object. once the first object reached the general area where the 2nd

simply “shown” that “they” exist.\r\n\r\nmy experience was as follows and this is what i remember very clearly & distinctively;\r\no\twe were at a friend “camp” north of president, pa on the upper allegheny river, very remote, there were 10 of us, standing around a huge bonfire drinking and talking.\r\n\r\no\tit was like time had stopped, through the smoke of the huge bonfire i could see a craft above, very close to me/us, it was blinking a light at me…i say “me” because i could feel, sense it was communicating to me directly. it was like i was in a trance and i looked away it seemed in very slow motion and then looked back and it was there doing it again. my surroundings, friends were motionless, i could see the fire burning and the smoke from the fire moving upwards but it was like everything was frozen for a while so i could see them. there was no message per say it was like “hey we exist” and then they were gone.\r\n\r\nimmediately after the event i knew it happened but didn’t say anything to anyone it seemed like my memory of this encounter was delayed or blocked until i woke up the next morning. but then it was time to drive 6 hours back home after being up at camp for a week. ever since that day of august 2, 2014 i think of see/envision this encounter every single day in my mind it’s like it was tattooed into my memory so explicit, exact it’s like it happened just minutes ago. i can visualize the craft perfectly but i cannot draw it and have tried many times, it was a design i have never seen before and i looked up online many hundreds of ufo drawings. the craft i saw was multi-sided, very irregular, between an octahedron and an icosahedron shaped object, opaque in color flashing simply a white rectangular light at me that was tilted at an angle left to right. it was not like any ufo drawing i have seen on internet searches. it doesn’t haunt me as so much as i have so many questions. i wasn’t scared and don’t remember any communication at all – i am scheduled for a regression next month in november as i want to know more especially since i hear “another encounter” very similar to mine above from a notable scientist i know. \r\n\r\nmy question have any others had a similar story to mine?\r\n\r\none other point, i am a very successful consultant to ceo's and b.O.D.'s so i'm not a wacko, although i've always been a \"believer\" i would like to know why i was contacted and or any info at all...Thanks\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

just sitting there, wind was not moving it. it looked controlled. any way i carried on to the chip shop with my girlfriend all the way saying that thing is weird ect.On the way back about twenty minuets later it was still there! just had move about 50ft in the sky from my view point and referencing of the building it was above. couldn't believe it was still there!!I got back to my girlfriends place on the fourth floor and looked out the back doors and got a clearer sighting of it. everyone was watching the football and i was showing them the thing in the sky, everyone was like \"what is that!!\" so i took my 14 meg pixel camera with a small zoom and zoomed in and started to recorded. also i noticed that there was a apache type looking helicopter flying very low just above the buildings in what seemed like a circle around it!! now i live in central london and have never seen any helicopter fly this low let alone a military one. it had the infrared nose one the front of it or what ever its called. so year i filmed it and thought it was very strange. i used to read world aircraft magazine and have seen some of the drones that were around at that time but im convinced it

potential flight patterns above.  i noticed the vibrant reflective properties, and the size and speed made me think that something at that altitude would stall.  i noticed what seemed to be a

away from my field of view (again, almost stall speed).  \r\n\r\ni am in so much disbelief and play devil's advocate in any situation where a ufo may have been a potentiality.  disbelief plagues any

very abruptly, showing another angle that had the three lights. then (to me, was was maybe a half inch from the 3 lights) a fourth yellow/orange light appeared. forming a triangle. it stayed there unwavering in anyway for maybe 15 seconds then completely disappeared, as if the lights had simply been switched off. i could not see anything in between the lights (as in nothing connecting them) its
