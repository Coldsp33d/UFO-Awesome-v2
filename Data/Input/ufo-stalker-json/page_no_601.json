live next to the ocean- so we have sirens in case of emergencies like tsunamis our sirens tones change and are not a constant tone. and also go off in multiples.\r\nthis was one singular tone, not crazy loud but loud enough to wake me up from a dead sleep, never changing in sound/ frequency or vibration but one solid tone for close to 45 minutes. i laid in bed for about 5 minutes just listening in to that one tone humming away. i usually get up by 5:15-5:30 so i decide  \"i need to just get up- cannot snooze with this sound anyways\" so i get outta bed and immediately go to the door and go outside. i have two dogs who didn't seem bothered in the slightest. i turn on my porch light and stand there for about 5 minutes to see if my neighbors may come out and see what the sound is. no one seems to hear it or come out so i look up and around- see nothing and go back in the house. i turn on my tv lay on the couch with my dogs and then the hum outside abruptly stops at id say about quarter to 6am. i think to myself \"thank goodness\" \r\nat around 6:30 i went outside to my car to grab a certain pair of shoes i left in the car from the work day before to only look up and see this white and blueish hued smoke trail with a big red ball of light zipping around and i almost fell over my jaw fell. id say more than half of this design photographed was already completed by the time i had seen it was near the tail end of its \"path\" it moved in all directions at some points seemingly stopping in mid air and changing course. and before i knew it it show to the left and vanished. \r\nbaffled from what i had just seen i ran into the house and grabbed my ipad and started taking photos. a neighbor of mine is witness to this from his regular morning walk.\r\ni go to work at about 7am everyday so i took as many decent pics as i could and zipped to work! i had to show a coworker before this floating trail disappeared. \r\ni get to work run in and tell my coworker to come outside and he proceeds and he sees some of the same remaining trail, i proceed to tell him what i saw and show him my ipad pictures and i say to him \"it was a red ball of light\" and we looked back up as i pointed to the area in the sky and we both witnessed the red ball of light appear and then vanish in the morning sky.\r\nmany people around my county have taken pictures of this as well. so there are literally probably hundreds of people who witnessed this event\r\n\r\nside note:\r\nwe have an airforce base 58 miles away. and the base said it was \"likely\" some kind of missle they sent out this morning. i saw it in the east which would have been over san luis obispo but the missle was said to be shot off west over the ocean and 58 miles south... sightings stretched from templeton to arroyo grande due east- not over the ocean at all. but this is no missle i have ever seen nor has my neighbor or my coworker and why would it reappear? or changed directions so quickly?","distance":"Over 1

house in ashby 3 miles away from scunthorpe i turned right on to the main road to go down burringham road hill as i started to go down the hill something made me look up to the sky i dont know why i looked up as this is something at the time i never done before and as i looked up there it was a silver disc going in and out of the clouds the ufo has like tiny little windows all around it at least i think they were windows because they were yellow in colour and it looked  to me like it had its lights on inside, as the ufo rotated round and round though the dark and then lighter clouds because it was getting dark the lights around it gave what look like a glowing effect there was no sound coming from it. i speeded down the hill to try follow it but i had no chance of catching up with it and it was not moving fast it just looked as if it was monitoring the area i cant be exact of the ufo's altitude but the way i would discribe it the height was about twice the height of what an helicopers flys ,the ufo headed towards the village of burringham and kidby bridge i only wish i had a camara that day ,and there was no one around that night so i could of stopped my car and said to someone look up there a ufo ,,there was not even a car in view and all so in my second sighting that ive all ready told you about even then i was with no witness both times ,and like i said in my first report this ufo i saw was only days after the rendlesham forest incident in suffolk in 1980 on december 26th ,,its know here in the uk as the british roswell ,, please ignore in my first report as i stated just the 1980 roswell incident i meant to write remdlesham forest incident hope this did'nt confuse you ,,ive included a sketch ive made the ufo a bit to big it was smaller than on the sketch and a

Rico","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My family and i were on vacation in costa rica at a resort near culebra. it was the last night we would be there and so i decided to go down to the beach and stargaze, which i do often. this was sometime around 10 p.M., but i am not sure. the moon was due sw and was around 55 degrees above the horizon, probably higher but not lower. that might indicate a time. i spent probably 25-30 minutes there before heading back, as i couldn't see much due to the bright moon. while walking back to the buildings (perhaps a 2-3 minute walk) i decided to look for the brightest star in the sky, something i also do often. i found it immediately, approximately 70 degrees above the horizon due nnw. it was somewhat brighter than jupiter would be on a clear night, but wasn't so unnaturally bright as to be immediately recognized as unnatural. while it was a mostly clear night, some stray clouds (cirrostratus, i think) were in the sky. they weren't thick, but they did obscure the stars around the object. it was clear that the object was behind the clouds, which is what made me interested in it. this star, or object, was sufficiently bright from behind the clouds to still be the brightest in the sky, and with a bright moon. i stopped walking to stand there and watch the clouds move away from the object, taking around 10-15 seconds. of course, the star-object became slightly brighter as a result. then, as i watched, it suddenly accelerated to the left, or west, and disappeared. the acceleration was unlike any i have seen, going from no movement to an incredibly high speed in apparently less time than human eyes are capable of seeing. it moved an unknown distance, but if i were to make a \"peace\" or \"v\" sign with my index and middle fingers, and held my hand out as far as possible, it would have appeared to travel the distance between those two fingers. or, at arm's reach, around 2-3 inches. it traveled that distance in about 1/2 of a second. at the end of that distance, it continued, but it was now quickly fading while moving left, with no apparent change of velocity. that took only 1/4 of a second. it is possible that the disappearance was the object leaving earth's orbit, and that the object was ascending while moving west. after that, there was no more sighting and i slowly walked back to the resort. i then felt amazement at what i had witnessed, immediately convinced that it was either from some origin other than humans, or that it was some incredible new human creation. either way, it was clearly not the following possible explanations:\r\n\r\n1: a conventional military aircraft. it hovered, not possible for planes, and it's velocity was too high for a vtol. not to mention that the acceleration the object would not be possible for any known aircraft, and for several reasons.\r\n\r\n2: a space station. while space stations can appear as bright stars that move, they cannot be unmoving, be unmoving and accelerate, move that fast, or disappear.\r\n\r\n3. a meteoroid. while an object such as this, when falling to earth, will certainly travel very fast and then disappear, it would not be unmoving and then suddenly accelerate.\r\n\r\na summary: an object, appearing as an unusually bright star, is visible behind cloud cover. it maintains its position for over 10 seconds before suddenly accelerating, apparently instantly, to an incredibly high speed. then, while keeping its speed, it fades and disappears.\r\n\r\ni attached a google earth view of the bay i was in, for your use.\r\n\r\ni would like to state that i was under the influence of no drugs, alcohol, or other agents that could have caused me to see things that weren't there.\r\n\r\nplease do not hesitate to contact me via email for clarification or follow-up. thank

i thought it was an airplane as the direction it was pointing towards in a route toward our airport.  the surprise was that other planes were in fact flying but were much higher and were not as clearly visible.  as i watched the craft it seemed to not be moving. i was stopped at a red light and then i really noticed that it as barely moving and it did not have wings, or tail, or any qualities associated with airplanes.  air planes don't hoover.  the colors thrown me, because it was very colorful with one half a clear blue color and the back half was gold.  but it did not fit in

lot and parked my car to watch. others began to pull over in their vehicles and park behind me and they too began to watch. i stood their pointing and watching then two small orbs appeared next the \"cigar shaped craft\" and as they approached the craft they seemed to circle the craft and fly next to it. then the \"cigar shaped craft\" began to move off very slowly into the distance until i watch it fade in the far distance. i thought to myself \"what the hell!\", \"it's broad day light for goodness sakes, during rush hour traffic, over a crowded sky, without a cloud in the sky! the blue

stories i encounted in my town .Ive been watching your programme on h2 thats how i found out about you anyway my first ufo i saw was in one  1981 and the other one was in 2008 in my own back yard beleieve it or not but its true i will tell you about the ufo i saw in my back yard first and then i'll write a separate report about  the one i saw in 1981 ,,so i'll start with the second sighting first,it was around 5.45 on the 4th of november 2008 i was in my back yard because that same day  a paserby pointed out one of my rear brake lights was'nt working so i had to wait for night time to fall so i could put a new bulb in and as i live on my own i had to wait for night fall so i could press the brake light against the rear was to see if both lights worked ok when i put the new bulb in anyway i put a new bulb in but still not working so i when to check the fuses under my steering so i was bobed down and as i bobed down to start the fuse check just above the houses in front of me an object was passing by from left to right i could'nt believe what i was seeing infact it was so pitch dark all ready which is unusually for 5.45 pm, so i could not see the shape of the ufo it was to dark but what i saw was 4 large yellow lights at the rear of the ufo 2 large lights one on the left and one on the right and just below it it had 2 smaller yellow lights these smaller lights were flashing on and off as it passed by there was not one sound coming from this thing and was not spinning this ufo was flying in a  straight line and was flying about 100 feet about the houses this is something that no helicoper or plane would ever in a residential area it would be against the law to fly that low but ufo's fly as they please , anyway i ran in to get my camara and when i came out it was still there in the distance but as i pointed my camara at it i could'nt get the lights to focus in my camara this was really strange maybe i was'nt pointed it right because by now it was in the distance then all i saw was the ufo dip and disappeared .Would you believe no one had reported seeing this within our town its so strange it came in my yard and no one else saw this what is this all about i asked my self first i see a ufo in january 1981 and now this ,i drew this scetch of the lights i saw on the night i drew this 10 minutes after the sighting while it was still fresh in my mind,,anyway i never believed in ufo until i saw the one in january 1981 and you know what i saw the 1981 ufo abou 2 weeks after the roswell incident that happened on the 26th december 1980..I will right about my 1980 ufo sighting a bit later tonight when i have time,,thanks ernesto\r\n","distance":"101-500

i- 95 sb around kingsland ga near the florida ga border. it was about 1 am when i saw a light in the sky a few hundred feet above the trees east of me in the woods a few hundred yards back on the other side of the road. at first i thought it was a tower with a light attached to it because of how high it was.  as i got closer i could tell that it wasn't a tower because it was a lot brighter and the light was pulsating getting stronger and weaker but only slightly.  i woke my wife up who was sleeping when i first saw it and asked her what she thought it was. we were both unsure and kept watching it as we were driving, because it was still visible to us in front of us. the object than started to change somewhat. i am not sure if it was because it was starting to move or because it changed shape.  when we first observed the object it was oval in shape but than it started to move slowly and kind of turned into a tear drop shape horizontally with the whole object glowing. the color of the object the whole time was a pale yellow orange light.  it started to clearly move horizontally now in a manner parallel to ground. it was hard to tell how fast because we were moving ourselves as i was still driving. it flew towards the east for a few seconds and than started to ascend higher at a rapid pace.  it made a sharp turn to the right of the path it was taking and straight up at a rate that was faster than any object i have ever seen move.  as fast as it was moving it was still visible as a light moving towards the stars until it was to far away to be seen. my wife and i felt that we had both seen something out of the ordinary and were more curious than anything else.

in the yard and standing at the backdoor. i live in a semi rural location,there is a garden of aprox 1/2 an acre backing on to mine so i have an unspoilt view of the sky and look up at the stars most nights because i find it beautiful and my interest outside the mainstream is in metaphysics so i look up wondering what unseen forces are out there,rather than looking for ufos. \r\n\r\nanyway a small star (aprox to my east) caught my eye as it shone very brightly, although i dont know the names of the stars i look at the sky for at least a short time each night and knew this was unusual, a very bright star/planet(sorry i dont know and dont want to guess as you will know what is visable from northwest uk ) i see every night was (aprox north east and higher in the sky. when i called my dogs back in i looked back over at the bright star and stood observing it, after about 10 seconds it glowed even brighter then took off at a 45 degree angle towards the south east, and left a faint trail visable for aprox 1/2 a second then disapeared. it took off so fast and at such and angle that i cannot imagine it being a manmade craft.\r\n\r\nwhilst i have always believed there must be alien life out there due to the vastness of our universe, i have never actively looked for ufos, and never expected to see one. i didnt even know there was star like type ufos until i did a bit of research,and at the time i didnt know it was a ufo until it took off. in the tick questions i didnt say it affected me mentally,because im not sure if this counts but i knew straight away after it took off it was a ufo but felt a sense of awe and calm rather than fear or panic. had it been closer i may have felt very differently though.\r\n\r\nthere are aircraft in my local area all the time,commercial jets,light aircraft,helicopters less often, and even small drones but iv come to know what these look and sound like, so i am 100% sure iv not confused it with any of these things. there was a small airplane aprox to north at the time, they move slowly and have lights at night. \r\n\r\nalso my dad is generally skeptical but has had some paranormal encounters,and when i told him i expected him to make a bit of fun of me, instead he told me he saw exactly the same thing 35 years ago when i was a babe in arms in a location 40ish miles away from where i saw this. because it wasnt a dramatic encounter he had almost forgotten about it and thats why he hadnt shared his this with me before.\r\n\r\ni saw a mufon on tv and decided i should report what i saw, as after some research there seems to have been a lot of ufo sightings on or around 23/09/15 date globally. authorities worldwide are obviously not sharing what they know with the public,but having seen something with my own eyes i want anwsers.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

see 4 bright ball shaped lights flying in formation. my first thoughts were why the raf would be flying this late so close to each other. they seemed quite a distance away and had passed over/near to a top us military observation base that's a couple of miles away. as they passed in front of me they changed positions. they were flying 2 at the front and 2 at the rear but then 1 at a time the ones at the front went to the rear in a diagonal move as if it went backwards even though they were still all flying forwards (this is when i knew they were ufos). they all changed positions as they continued across the sky then all accelerated upwards and vanished towards space, not over the horizon. i was really shocked after i saw them and felt amazed at what i had witnessed almost it felt unbelievable. i ran in the house and told my gf (ex) what i had seen but she didn't believe it. a couple of days later i looked on the internet and saw that other people had witnessed similar things that weekend. even to this day i can not stand outside my house without feeling what i felt that night and often wonder if i will see them again and since that night i have felt different in my mood
