flash point of light was about three times the size of venus....But it was a burst of white light.   it lasted two seconds or even less.....It was over fast.  \r\n\r\ni continued to watch the sky to see if i could see a plane or just what it was...  and about 30 seconds later, the light burst again and went out.   it was in a slightly different spot in the sky, but close to where i say the first flash of light.    i watched for a couple more minutes.   i was kind of spooked a little as i was in a dark field, woods all around and no one else out side with me.    \r\n\r\nnot sure what it was.  it was not a meteor.  it was not the flash from an iridium satellite, as it happened too fast.  i did not see anything but those two quick bright bursts of light.

canada. i had a window seat and was flying alone but did have people seated next to me. i was looking out of my window and the sun was high, it must have been in the early afternoon sometime and there were little to no clouds. it was early into the flight, its hard for me to remember how far exactly into the flight we were but somewhere around a couple of hours. i saw out in the blue sky a line of demarcation, where it appeared the blue colour of the sky was a slightly different, yet still very distinguishably different, shade of blue. i followed the line with my eye and realized it was shaped like a triangle with rounded edges. it appeared to be about 200-300ft away from the plane but that is hard to say. the triangle area seemed to be huge, about the length of a football field or two and i want to say closer to two, but that is also hard to say. i sat there and watched it for about 20mins before it was out of my sight. i noticed the person sitting in front of me saw it but i never spoke to them and they never spoke up about what they saw. i just sat there quietly as well, i was a teenager at the time and was too afraid to speak up. i regret that now as well as waiting until now to tell mufon because now my memory of the event isn't what it once was. you never know what is important information and i have a deep belief in the possibility of other life in this universe, so i wish i spoke up sooner. i didn't own a camera or cell phone at the time either so no photos i'm afraid.\r\ni thought it might have been something on my window making it look like something was outside but that wasn't it. we passed by it, it was stationary like it was just hoovering there. it looked very much like there was a solid triangle there but it was invisible other than that demarcation line from the 2 different shades of blue. you could just tell there was something there in the sky and it was big. i think about it a lot, whatever it was it affected me deeply. while in the plane and looking at the triangle in the sky i felt very weird. it was like everyone on the plane was in their own little world or bit out of it because it was dead quiet and totally inactive. i air felt still and i was slightly uncomfortable. this all could have been due to me just sort of freaking out a bit about what i was looking at but the energy in the plane felt weird like something was happening but nothing was. im probably not making any sense now sorry. moving on, i know what i saw and i believe strongly that it was real, that something solid was there. just thought i should let mufon know. hope it helps.\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\nalayna","distance":"101-500

the object briefly to get my wife to witness it when we both came back it was behind the tree line at that point it was a bright blue (left) and bright red (right) level object that pulsated\r\n5

some i couldn't find it in the camera i switched my phone over to photo and and snapped a picture but still couldn't find it then my phone died unexpectedly. i then ran to get my wife brought her to the backyard and she witnessed it as well but from behind trees. roughly 1 hour later i heard a whiting sound and my wife and i could hear my oldest son who sleeps in the room next to us crying. i went to check on him and it appeared he had woken from a nightmare. i brought him to\r\nthe bed with me and my wife to calm\r\nhim and when i asked him if he had a nightmare he said 'no.' when i asked him what was wrong he said he was scared. when i asked him if he had a goosebumps television show dream he said 'no i was awake' so i asked him what are you scared of he said 'i don't want to go to the stars' and my wife asked me if that was something he saw in the goosebumps movie today and i said 'yes' but it wasn't i lied so i would not scare her. at that point i thought my\r\nson may have been asked to go to the stars by something' after a minute passed i confessed to my wife that nothing like what my son was describing had happened in the movie and that i just said it did so i wouldn't 'freak her out' \r\n\r\ni asked my son why he was scared of going to the stars because he has a sticker mural of the solar system\r\nin his room and he said 'because it was too
