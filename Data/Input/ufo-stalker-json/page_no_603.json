readjusting of the scope.This has a very unusual pettern in that it is very erratic in movement while hovering at the same time,it makes no sound and it is very hard to judge its distance.I have also seen another object to the south much smaller in size with the same erratic movements while continuing to hover at the same time.I have never notified the athuarities however i will be making a visit and let them know i am watching the night sky .Will continue to watch the sky as i have been and so you know i did file another report and a woman if i have the name right is margie terry she should

object directly in front of me in the sky about 50 degrees above the horizon that i thought was a plane, but i thought something was weird about it because instead of blinking the lights were dimming then getting brighter over the course of a few seconds, then suddenly it disappeared and reappeared in the same area of sky but it had moved at least 50-100 miles through the sky in less than a second, there were no other planes in sight when this occurred. i lost sight of the object because of my orientation on the highway at the time and when i had a clear view of the sky it was no longer there. \r\n\r\ni had just dropped a friend off in mt. joy and she had pointed out the object and said \"look that's a ufo, those aren't normal plane lights.\" she has a tendency to think planes are ufos so i blew it off at first until i was alone and watched the object teleport in front of me through the sky.\r\n\r\ni've seen ufo phenomenon before but nothing compelling enough to make me file mufon report until now.\r\n\r\nwhen i witnessed the object teleport i changed my radio to a station that was receiving only static at the time and there was some sort of weird interference occurring until i lost sight of the object. \r\n\r\ni feel it is worth mentioning that throughout my life i've had several extremely vivid dreams of large objects moving over me through the sky, these dreams felt like memories that had been erased because i could smell and feel the air  around me which is completely unusual for all of my dreams. i've had one out of body meditative experience where i feel i made brief contact with an entity of higher intelligence. \r\n\r\nat this point in my life what i have witnessed has removed much of my skepticism, i still view every encounter i have through the scope of science and logic to try to find an explanation other than extraterrestrials but i am at the point where i feel i have many unanswered questions regarding these experiences and this is why i have chosen to file a mufon report, i hope my report might turn up some answers to these questions...","distance":"Over One

him i wanted to go inside, he insisted we watch for a few more mins. i'm going to say it went on for a good five mins. he finally suggested maybe it were a satellite, i agreed but then asked \"well, why did the other star zig zag around it minutes before?\" suddenly the middle star started jumping. i figured it was my eyes from staring at it for so long so i took my eyes off it for a few seconds at a time and focused on other stars then went back to it, but there it was, still dancing around. \r\nfinally it just stopped and went back to its place. maybe it was a satellite but can those jump from spot to spot side ways quickly and do fast circles? and why the shooting star (meteor?) fly past it then backwards and around it? \r\ntruly freaked out. my boyfriend is being so cool calm and

paper route in thornville ohio. when we was only about 30 minutes into the route on ridenour road, my friend was observing something out the window. the next thing i know he says 'stop the car' he had a very serious demeanor, so i did. he continued to look out the window without saying anything. i was unable to see anything from the driver seat so at 3;30 in the morning and on a back country road i parked the car and stepped out. it was then i realized what my fiend was looking at. off not too far in the distance, maybe 150 yards out was an oval shaped object with red green and white lights on the bottom of the craft from four points flashing in random order. also on each side of the craft were wings. they were not like wings you would see on a typical plane. they were attached by what looked like to be a metal beam or rod and the wings themselves were u- shaped. the craft was ascending into the sky, neither of us ever saw it on the ground, just from the point of ascension. once it reached it maximum altitude of 250 to 300 fee at the most it began to hover for a few seconds. then it proceeded to move in our direction at a very slow pace. the craft was completley silent. it made no noise or left any traces behind it. when it finally reached the road where we were, it was about 300 feet directly above us. it was about a football field in length and diameter. while both of us stared up in shock and amazement, a 5th center light illuminated purple. both of us were to much in awe to move. the bottom of the craft appeared to be shiny. it then continued its path in the direction it had been going never gaining speed or altitude. it was at this point my friend told me to grab my camera, and i took 2 still shots and 3 short videos. we continued to watch it till it was out of sirte. we then got back in the car and finished the route, in the direction rhe craft had traveled. never seeing it again. it wasnt until morning that we checked our

cannon beach, oregon, for the weekend.\r\nat 11:25 pm pt, friday, october 2nd 2015, i was looking due west over a row of beachfront motel units. \r\ni noticed a very bright, steady, orange light out over the ocean. the moon was not in the hemisphere, and there were no noticeable clouds. the day had clear skies. winds were calm.\r\nwhen i opened the sliding door i noticed that the light was slowly moving towards the east, towards the shore, at an even speed and steady altitude. i would guess it was above a thousand feet.\r\nthe light was not a pin-point, but a distinct round shape. i looked for a cowling shadow or surface reflection, but could see none. \r\n\r\nthe round light was intense, but not like a searchlight, there was no beam effect. there was no strobe or flutter effect, either. i was able to catch a smartphone video of 56 seconds. the video shows some strobing, but that is mostly due to the auto-focus of the phone trying to maintain focus on a light source in the dark.\r\n\r\nat 3 seconds in i zoom to maximum, hence the greater distortion and apparent change in size.\r\nat 31 seconds the light moves behind the row of motel units where we were staying. the jostling is me stepping out onto the patio deck to capture a few more seconds.\r\n\r\ni could not tell how fast it was moving since there was no background reference.\r\nfrom the angle shift (+30 degrees at first sighting, facing west, to +60 degrees south-southeast) and the duration, someone with trigonometric skills could roughly figure out the height and speed.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound, above the sound of the ocean waves. the engine roar sound on the video seems loud, but to my ear it was a distant rumble of surf. helicopters make a distinctive sound at the beach, whether coast guard or otherwise. this was not the light of a helicopter or conventional plane. there were no other lights, no navigational lights, and no other bright lights in the sky for the next half hour.\r\n\r\nearlier in the day, around 5 pm pt, my wife and i had seen two drones flying near haystack rock. they had very small white beacon lights and moved in irregular patterns and changed altitude from time to time.\r\n\r\nthe video isn’t very good, but it is a few seconds (56 seconds) of 'interesting' light.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

behind a known museum site. towards 12.10am, i noticed a particular star that was white and bright, took note of it and it suddenly saw it move horizontally across, quite a distance, from the right to the left. it stopped, became red and disappeared.\r\n\r\nwas baffled by it but didn't think much of it at the time. thought it could have been a plane/planet/shooting star.\r\n\r\nwalked back at 12.20am from location to city centre, disappointed and cold, from not having seen any northern lights so far. went to the 24hr grocer behind, came out with food at 1 - 1.10am, and walked back towards apartment. \r\n\r\nlooked up as i was walking and the northern lights appeared for a good 2-4mins approximately.  northern lights then cleared up, and i stood there, hoping for an encore. i then noticed in the dark clear sky, a silver frisbee like object , approaching from nw of view. it seem to flutter/ swing a little side to side, left to right.\r\n\r\nstood there dumbfounded, trying to make out what it was as it got closer and lower. my mind tried deciphering it, was it a remote controlled uav/toy/bird/bat/comet? it had moments where it looked like a rugby ball with hints of orange red and became clearer as it tilted at an angle and descended lower.\r\n\r\nit then became apparent that it was a disc shape,with a shadow cast on it, which was a dark black/grey, along with what looked like orange red light/glow coming from the edge of the disc. it was not a glowing ball, but i could see the it was emitting a glow from the edge end of the disc. what amazed me further was i could see some detail on it, what looked like a vertical line and horizontal curve line, resembling a 't' on its side.\r\n\r\nit temporarily hovered from the right of my view, then did a swift move that was fast but not too fast, at a constant speed!, to the left. never seen any aircraft/remote controlled uavs/satelites...Nothing that moved like that in my life. it moved left and hovered for a few seconds, moved up sped off upwards and out of my line of sight.\r\n\r\ni then stood there, completely blank, trying to make sense of what i saw, and felt stupid for not having taken out my camera.\r\n\r\nwent back to the apartment, still trying to collect my thoughts of what i just saw, but was confused no less. after half an hour to an hour of calming down, i thought nothing more of my sighting and wanted to see if the northern lights would reappear. i then opened my window to take a look outside, and saw nothing but dark sky. \r\n\r\nhowever, i suddenly had this urge to look above me, and right above me, from what i can remember seeing, was part of a semi-circle shape, over my apartment's roof, with orange lights and one red light.  i remembered just staring at the red light and suddenly realising that, that what i was looking at, was not part of the apartment's structure.  \r\n\r\nupon realising this, i slowly stepped back into my apartment and closed the window shaken with the knowledge that what i saw earlier was much closer to me now. fear suddenly kicked in and i just stayed awake till past 3am. nothing more happened, made some calls to family and then eventually fell asleep.\r\n\r\ntill today, i'm not sure if all my sightings are interconnected, at least not with the 'star' that i saw in the park.  just know that what i saw outside that parking lot right outside my apartment, and above my apartment window were the same thing.  and now i'm totally convinced they're still out there.  believing in their existence is one thing, seeing it is a whole different experience altogether.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:01:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

to go on my front porch which faces west and smoke a cigarette before getting a cup of coffee. there is a small overhang over the porch. i have a standard chair that i sit in and i put my feet on a guardrail in front of the chairs. when i do that it causes my butt to slide forward and lets me face the sky where i look every morning. it helps me enjoy the coffee and wake slowly. i was almost done with my smoke and was getting ready to get up. don't think this is funny, but when i noticed this thing, i thought it was a flock of geese. (i hadn't had my coffee yet so my brain was a bit slow.) then my logic clicked in and i realized that geese aren't lighted, they wobble and bob around flying, i can't recall ever seeing geese at night, and it was way too fast. the only thing that resembled geese was the shape. it was a perfect geese like v-shape of lights. it was cloudy. the thin clouds like fog and they were low so all i saw were the v-shaped lights moving smoothly. i would say it was moving about the same speed as an airplane would. i just thought it was weird that something would fly in that area, because i live less than a 1/4 mile in the path of an airport, and a usual plane from that airport would fly right into it. i had a thought that they could have it on radar probably. because of the wispy clouds all i could see were the lights. i would guess that it was a triangle, but it would be a guess. i looked online and found a nearly identical image of what i saw. it looked exactly like the picture of the v-shaped lights in yantai, shandong, china. it was just strange that there was no sound at all from it. i stood up and watched it fly in that straight line out of sight. i will have my camera ready from now on. the photo attached isn't one i took, but very close to what i saw. i found this picture online.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":71633,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.63224538791382,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10182015-0005","longitude":-81.72566150517751,"occurred":1445141100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1445147947000,"summary":"V-shaped silent flying craft seen through thin clouds","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/71633_submitter_file1__vshapedpinemanor.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"33907","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Lehigh Acres, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:3984"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":603}
