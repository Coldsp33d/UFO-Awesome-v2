got done making love. i was watching a college football game when out of the corner of my eye i noticed a bright flashing light flying lower that what an airplane should be flying. i live right next to the connelsville airport so planes and helicopters are very commonplace near my house, seeing multiple craft on a day to day basis. this was completely different and for the record both my girlfriend and i were completely and totally sober. there was two lights blinking together at first heading south southwest pulsating a white light and occasionally throwing in hints of green and orange. when i pointed it out to my girlfriend i turned off the tv turned off my fan and turned out the lights in my room and we opened the window and went and stood beside it so we could watch. well before she even saw the objects the one had completely stopped blinking so there was only one pulsating light as the craft turned and began heading south east instead. we watched the craft flying fairly low, well below the cloud cover, for between 5-10 minutes as it would occasionally stop and hover then continue on it's path. it was pulsating different color lighting alternating between white and orange and green but mostly white. there was absolutely no sound, and being that i live near an airport, i know as close as this object was if it were a helicopter or some conventional craft there'd be some sound. it travelled across the sky blinking the whole time without making a single sound. it was an oval shaped craft as best as i could tell weigh blinking lighting and of what i could see it looked to be much bigger than the single engine and other smaller aircrafts that fly out of connelsville. it slowly faded into the background as it kept traveling and i was getting ready to go outside while my girlfriend continued watching it. she then said it blinked 3 times right before completely disappearing from view. i personally have been interested in the ufo phenomenon for quite some time but i have never seen anything like this before in my life. feel free to check my story and contact me for a follow up and/or if you have

car\". he had a very serious demeanor so i did. he continued to stare out the window, without saying anything. i kept looking but was unable to see anything from the driver seat. so 3:30 in the morning and on a back country road i put the car in park an stepped out. soon as i did i see what my friend was looking at. off not too far off in the distance maybe 150 yards away was an oval shaped object  with red white and green lights on the bottom of the craft from four  points flashing in randomized order. also one each side of the craft werea wings, looked what was attached by some sort of metal beam or rod, and the wings were not the typical kind of wings you would see on a plane, they were curved, almost in a u shape. the craft was ascending into the sky.  neither of us seen it on the

at 11:03 pm on 10/11/15.\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\ntom,\r\n \r\nsharon was looking out our bedroom window about 15 minutes ago and she said she saw a ufo. i looked at it and i think it may be a ufo bit i’m not sure.\r\n \r\nit is small looking, about the size of a large star, and it is not very bright. i went outside to look at it and i could see it sometimes. when i went to the front of our house there was more ambient light and i couldn’t really see it.\r\n \r\nwe have a venetian blind on the window and it is down but it is open. we believe the light is moving around but it is staying in one small area of the sky. in other words it hasn’t moved from the south to the east in the sky and the angle of azimuth hasn’t changed by more than say 5 degrees. a venetian blind has strings that run vertically. i moved my head so that the ufo was between 2 vertical strings. it appeared that the ufo moved outside the strings. i looked at it in relation to 2 of the horizontal slats and again the ufo appears to be moving up and down. i’m not sure if i am holding my head steady enough or if the apparent movement of the ufo might be from me moving my head slightly but not by my own volition. what it reminds me of is a flying kite that is pretty much staying in the same spot but just moving around randomly. the brightness of the ufo changes randomly too. \r\n \r\ni am looking approximately to the south (almost directly south compared to north main st. the azimuth is about 25 degrees. i just looked again and it is still there. we’ve seen it for 28 minutes. i know my camera won’t see anything if i take a picture. is there anything we can do to get some more convincing information that it is a ufo? i don’t even know if you’re awake and on line but i hope so.\r\n \r\npat shriver\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n10/17/15\r\n\r\nby looking at the street map and estimating the angle north main makes with true south (15 degrees) and estimating the angle the ufo was from parallel to south main (4 degrees) the ufo was about 19 degrees west of south. the ufo was circular in shape. what we were seeing was not scintillation or twinkling of a star. i went outside and looked at the ufo without looking through any glass so the ufo wasn’t a reflection of light. our address is 1161 north main st. north canton, ohio 44720. there was nothing near the ufo in the sky such as tree branch or an antenna so i couldn’t estimate the distance along the ground that the ufo was from our address. sharon shriver is my wife.\r\n\r\nwhen viewing the ufo we were fairly confident that the ufo was an unidentified flying object and not a plane, helicopter, satellite, or a planet. we were not 100% certain it was a ufo and would like mufon to check to see if it made sense that it was something that could be explained.\r\n\r\nafter watching the ufo for 30 minutes we quit watching it and went to bed. it was still visible when we quit watching it.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":71606,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.89555488485429,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10172015-0009","longitude":-81.38993472148279,"occurred":1444602600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1445086949000,"summary":"Saw
