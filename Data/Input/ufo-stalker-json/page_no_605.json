sure my parents weren't. going off their rockers after about 5 minutes. i went to go in the street lights went off i looked around to see what looked like a giant flock of birds as i looked closer they were not only changing color from black to dull gray then to shiney looking silver blue it was also changing shape like it was art almost dancing gracefully like birds in the sky i watched it for about 1 minute and it went through the tree line. my father was at a farther. distance on his way back and saw the same thing only what he saw was more solid but ended and begun the same shape i had saw i freaked  ran in the house looked nonlinear to see if there was anyone else who was seeing this i called lex18 and thelady said there was a post on the visitor page on facebook about strange

walk around, the man in the heavy back hoe repeated. so i walked around drinking my beer and crossed back across the street to the safe end and looked up. there was white orbs just stagnant in the air, did not move at all. i was walking as i was in awe looking up and it just didn't register in my head. i stopped at hastings and hawks in vancouver because i was looking up and because i was near hastings street i had to stop because a bus went by, i watched the bus go by and looked up again and they seemed so high they where barely visible. i looked both ways across the street and back up and they where gone. i had no idea what they where but assumed they where aliens and it didn't start to bother me tell about months and a year later, it was 2014, in the summer. not sure the date. my father thinks i am crazy. \r\n    no motion, they did not move at all.\r\n\r\n  i started to tell people down the street and they smiled and believed me. it has been chewing away at me for a while now. and i have all kinds of crazy ideas to why they are here. my imagination is going crazy. \r\n\r\ni lost sight simply because i had to look across a busy street. i had heard of sightings so i was not scared at the time but now i am.\r\n\r\n   they where above mt seymour i think, not sure. people always get lost up there and search and rescue hilcopters are there several times a year. there is

lived with her boyfriend paul sauders of 10 plus years. paul owned the texaco station located between qnot and poland indiana. we had full service station, diner, trash routes and several rental properties. mom did all book keeping for pauls businesses. we lived within 70-100 ft of the texaco station on hill. i remember the leaves were still on trees and we didn't need coats to take trash outside that night. we had a dumpster on right side of station which was directly across from our side door off kitchen and screened in porch. lisa, my older sister had one side of can and i other. we had little concrete sidewalk we walked down dragging this can about midway. i don't recall which of us looked up first but while holding can we both stopped..We exchanged words like what's that..I remember standing there. the object was hugh and 3d almost. totally black on bottom and top, rectangular. the sides all around were soft almost memerizing...I never felt fear just awe...At that moment lisa dropped her half of the trash can, twisting my wrist, she turned and ran inside yelling ufo..Or something like that.. i don't recall looking back up again, but did put down my half ran into the screened i porch area and mom and paul were coming out..When i turned and went bad out the porch door onto sidewalk...It was gone.  it was seconds and i was gone.. no sound, no wind, no noise while it was there..Just darker than the night sky, almost like a void with very distinct sides with light show i will never forget...I never heard it leave..Never felt the wind like you would from a car driving by that close..It was so close you felt like you could touch it. the garage was about 60' long, the object hoovered about 2 foot from touching the garages flat top roof. it \"hoovered\" starting about 20-30 ft over the roof but rest of its body was 3-4 times longer.  the night of garage was 10 ft ceiling and had partial mezzanine we had for part storage..The garage back was buttes up to hillside that was 4-8 ft high. the object looked like u could step on hillside and reach up and touch it.\r\nit is feeling and site i will never forget..Mom and paul mentioned that same night there were other spottings around lake area and even it was in newpaper. parents and older folks talked about these other siting and jets went over flying low more than i remember anywhere or more

happened to look out my bedroom window when i saw a star like object in the sky  very low in the sky with no exact form.It was not blinking like an airplane was not moving like a satalite would it had no noise comming from it no blinking lights it was still and it was what a star looks like but bigger and about the height where the clouds should be the sky ws clear. i first noticed it because it was so bright and not moving.I thought it was a star until i stuck my head out my window and noticed it was where the clouds should be and could not be a star.When i awoke early in the morning i just happened to look at the clock to see what time it was and my digital box said 5:20 so i looked out my window that was ajar with my fan in it to see if he sun was rising and noticed a very large bright white like a star object at first that's what i thought it was i then realised it was where the clouds would lay in the sky so there's no way it could have been a star i tried to stare at it but it was so bright it was almost like looking at the sun so i stuck my head out my window and adjusted my eyes and stared at it it had like orbish streames of teal blue and red when i stared at the middle of the bright white i could see like streams of colorful lights or aura i layed back in my bed and stared at it it did not move airplanes go by over head around my place this was not an airplane up north i have seen satellites and it wasn't moving slowly it was just there sitting almost.My feelings were confusion and almost like a shock because i couldn't put my thumb on what i was seeing or what it wasn't.A little freaked out!I last seen the object at around 545 am and then i fell back asleep because im a mother of three and was exhausted and needed to wake up again at 7:00 am to bring my oldest child to school.I couldn't believe i fell asleep then at 7:10 am it was gone.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Pretty much every night i have lived here, especially recently, i have watched two types of mysterious orbs hovering around the area i live on for years. about a year ago i was with a friend and we both saw what appeared to be like a meteor falling from the sky at a very high speed and made it all the way to the ground, landing somewhere due west, probably in the range of 3 to 8 miles. what was incredible about that event was the fact that this object was like a huge green fireball and mysteriously appeared visible only from an altitude of approximately 1,000 to 3,000 feet and did not originate from way up in the sky as a meteor would. about 3 or 4 years ago i observed several star like bright objects high in the sky making irregular movements at rapid speeds sometimes changing direction instantaneously and one night one appeared to the east of my house and was as close as i had seen before so i decided to point a very powerful green laser directly at it for just a second and i was absolutely shocked to see the object emit 5 projectiles towards me falling all the way to the ground at high speed that looked just like shooting stars one at a time in about one second intervals and they appeared to land in 5 different locations somewhere between thr object and myself as close as a couple football fields away from me. in shear terror at what i may have done and what the projectiles could be, i ran inside my house, locked the doors, and sat in fear the rest of the night. occasionally i see single blue-white light orbs which hover near the treetops and randomly flash in a strobe-like manner changing brightness intensity and then disappear after a while. the orbs i see literally every night i look that are more common are more yellow-white in hue (often it looks like there is also somehow sonething invisible in front of them which is hard to explain and doesn't make any sense) and hover usually in pairs between the ground and the treetops and move slowly in wave-like motions and tend to move toward my residence from the west usually and have been seen as close as 100 yards from my house.  the property i live on is over 600 acres of wilderness and my home is located in the southeast corner of the property. a couple years ago i started to try to attempt to get as close as possible to the objects and get photographs and video evidence (which i have, but i was very surprised to see that the orbs are extremely small when viewed through camera lenses, almost reduced to mere dots of light which is strange because the orbs appear to be approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter, and the videos are always disappointing..). they would always disappear and reappear further away once i got to be within about 100 yards, but one night i guess i got too close to one as i walked over a ridge to the edge of a clearing and when i stepped out of the trees at the edge of the ridge the orb about 50 to 100 feet away suddenly flashed the brightest light i've ever seen, as if i had just looked at a flash bang grenade explosion, which stunned me and blinded me for almost 30 seconds as all i could see in my field of vision was blackness after the burst of light occured, and it happened so suddenly i have no idea if it was a beam of light toward me or an emission in all directions, but once my vision returned the orb was gone. when the orbs are somewhat nearby the energy in the atmosphere becomes almost electric, as if they are charging the air, and when i am in their vicinity the hair on my arms and legs stands straight up and stays that way and i feel a sense of excitement. i know they are intelligent and aware of my presence and i can't help but wonder if they wish to communicate telepathically. my impression is that they seek like a more advanced version of what humans currently use as drones, whose purpose has something to do with exploration and the collection of data and general observation, as they seem to \"survey\" their surroundings. i am writing this now because i am watching unsealed: alien files \"alien messages\" and i was blown away to learn of an event where a man had a similar experience to my flash of light after touching an invisible craft with orb like lights and had received a message in binary code which was later translated to read something titled \"exploration of humanity\" i believe, which gave me chills and the fact that the phenomenon around my home is currently ongoing inspires me to try to explore the possibility of further communicating with the ufos if possible and because the remote location i live in is such a hotspot for strange events i felt mufon may be interested as well.","distance":"21-100 Feet,
