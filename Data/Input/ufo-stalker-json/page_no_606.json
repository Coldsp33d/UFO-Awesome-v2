times before heading west completely. then a helicopter showed up apparently moving towards the light and from there the light seemed to move south towards where i was, in the street. it continued to shimmer/flash and as what appeared to be the helicopter went north instead moving towards it, the light began to move east. once it was about parallel with 71st ne avenue but very far north, it began heading north and slowly fell out of the distance. it was fully bright and emanating light the whole time.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I drove down from minneapolis to visit friends in britt, ia. during the course of my visit the blood moon was taking place so we sat in lawn chairs in someone's front yard to watch the event.  the yard we were in was on the northwest edge of town so there were open farm fields to the north and the west of where we were sitting with the small town of britt to the east and south of us.  the eclipse of the moon was in itself a mysterious event and having seen many ufos myself in minnesota over the years i was leery that the blood moon may be trigger another event somehow.\r\n\r\nit's interesting to note that i had mentioned to the other people i was with that i was fearful that there may be a ufo event because there was an eeriness in the air that night.  the two different families from britt that i was with both mentioned that they had witnessed triangular ufos in the area recently.  the owner of the house we were at said that two years ago a triangular ufo hovered over the field just north of her house for over two hours.  she, her family and the other family from britt who was there had seen some triangular ufos when they were camping in july, 2015 (two months earlier) in crystal lake, ia.\r\n\r\non the night of the blood moon, we were focused on the progress of the eclipse and right before the moon was almost completed covered, i noticed several flashes of light in front of the moon that resembled flashes from cameras going off at the same time.  a few seconds later an object appeared from the east (which is the same direction we were looking at the moon).  it was heading right for us and was approximately 100 yards above the tree tops.  it didn't look like an airplane, for one thing is that it was absolutely silent.  as it approached us we could see that it was triangular in shape with several white lights on the edge with one red and one green light flashing.  \r\n\r\nas this first ufo was fast approaching us, a second identical triangular ufo appeared from nowhere just south of the first object and took off to the north at a high rate of speed toward the first object.  we thought the second object was going to collide with the first object as the second one accelerated at a high rate of speed and just missed the first object but what seemed like inches.\r\n\r\nthe first object then went right over our heads and the seven of us were able to tell that it was a solid, triangular shaped object.  the first object then moved over the town of britt and stopped about 5-6 miles out of town to the northwest where it hovered in place for a couple hours.  the second object moved over the town of britt and stopped about 5-6 miles out of town to the northeast and hovered in place for hours.  the first and second ufos appeared between 9:30 and 10pm.  around 10:30pm, a third triangular ufo appeared from nowhere in the east and moved over britt until it reached the hovering first object.  once it reached the first object, it hovered n place about 100 yards above the first object.  the two objects hovered close to each other for awhile until the first object finally became moving to the west and eventually floated out of sight.\r\n\r\nthe second object that was hovering 5-6 miles in the northeast part of town was joined by a fourth triangular object that showed up from nowhere and hovered near the second object.  between 9:30 pm and 2am we counted at least 14 triangular ufos appearing and hovering over and around britt.  we took a break for a half hour around midnight and eventually went to bed at 2am so it's possible that there were more than 14 ufos because new objects kept appearing all night long and were still active when we went to bed.\r\n\r\nwe took pictures and a video of the objects but it's interesting to note that the second object that was still hovering to the northeast when we went to bed at 2am wouldn't let us take its picture.  it was much brighter than the stars but when we took pictures of that particular ufo, only the fainter stars showed up but the ufo didn't.\r\n\r\nwe were wondering if these objects had come for us because it didn't make sense why they were hovering outside of britt.  there are no military installations there and it's a farming community. the closest airport is a regional airport in mason city, ia which is 30 miles away.  what did they want?  interestingly, my friend and i were afraid to go to bed because we may not wake up or may wake up with unexplained injuries.  it should be noted, however, that when we did wake up the next morning we had unexplained pains that appeared after we went to bed.  his pain was in his back.  for me, i had a pain that ran from my hip all the way down to the back of my left knee.  i needed to see my chiropractor every other day for the next two weeks to cure the mysterious injury to l3 in my back.  my chiropractor was perplexed and asked if i had done anything unusual because my back issues were in a place that we've never needed to adjust before.\r\n\r\nin july, 2015 my same group of friends i was visiting in britt, ia had gone camping in crystal lake, ia and had a close range encounter with one of these same triangular shaped ufos.  i asked if anything unusual resulted from the encounter and my friend mentioned that the next morning both batteries on his bus were completely dead.  the bus had always started no problem before this night and after charging the batteries has had no problems since.  no dome lights were left on that could have drained the batteries because they would have noticed they had left their lights on since they were sleeping in the bus.\r\n\r\nalso in 2015, there were reports that all the fish and algae in crystal lake (crystal lake, ia) were killed and nobody has had an explanation as to why.  now crystal lake is the clearest it's ever been and it's easy now to see the bottom of the lake. there have also been posts on facebook lately that people in storm lake, ia have been witnessing these same triangular shaped ufos.  storm lake is less than 60 miles west of britt and it's interesting to note that many of the triangular shaped ufos we saw in britt moved through town and continued west, perhaps on their way to storm lake.\r\n\r\nmy friend from britt visited me in minneapolis a week later and we were listening to music when suddenly two of my five cd changers both stopped working at exactly the same time.  we used a different cd player to listen to a new cd but the new cd stuck on one song.  at that point i went outside on my deck and saw the same triangular object moving away from my part of town.  that object was about three miles south of my house and was moving west.  interestingly, since then my friend from britt was at my house again and we watched a sphere shaped ufo appear in the northwest and move to the southeast over the city of minneapolis when suddenly it imploded and disappeared in mid-air.  this same friend also texted me last saturday (october 10) that he was watching another triangular ufo hovering 5-6 miles to the northeast of britt, ia again.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path

on the inside of the windshield. we quickly deduced it wasn't a light from inside the truck due to the light crossing over the road in front of us heading toward the north sky. i watched as the light, now in the north sky began traveling east. we stopped and exited the vehicle it was at this time we both noticed multiple, now small star like, blinking objects moving curiously in mostly the southwestern sky. randomly, the objects would cease their blinking and become continuous lights. binoculars were taken from the truck and though all the object's lights could be seen the shape could not be determined. two of the objects, which had moved into the west sky, made fast 90 degree turns and one turned quickly and flew over us. they seemed lower than a commercial jet's altitude. the object which had crossed overhead then turned and headed back to the south sky where it came to a sudden halt in the sky and changed it's color into a golden yellow and it's brightness intensified. eventually all the objects moved out of sight and after a few more moments we could no longer see any of the objects.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

had the faint sound of the wind as it moved to\r\nthe south.  it was maybe 10' above me when it was directly in front of me.\r\nthe image as it appeared was one of mass, very large, maybe 50 to 75

decided to follow the flashes to see if we could find the source.  we drove north on prospect, then the flash moved east so we took a right on artesia blvd. and then left on meadows ave.  the flashes

as i was continuing to walk south and noticed the light going to the right, then stopping, going up, then stopping, going down, then stopping.  it continued going a little right, a little left, a little up, a little down and then moving forward getting closer to my area.  the green light was getting brighter, and it was impossible to see a shape because of the distance.  i continued to go toward my house and would lose sight for a few seconds as the top of the houses and trees blocked my view until i was able to see it again in between the houses.  i arrived at my house and could see it there so i went in and grabbed my iphone to record it.  i went into my yard and started recording, but even with the zoom, i wouldn't get anything close enough to make out a shape.  the color and movement can clearly be seen.  i was trying to get my wife to come downstairs and see it, so i had to stop the recording and go in and get her.  when i came back out with her, it changed to a flashing red and silver color and started dropping.  i was able to record a portion of that and then it got too low behind the tree line from my neighbor.  i kept the camera going in case it reappeared and it didn't.  i went back in front of the house since there is a better view and i saw it again, but now it was all red and it was much farther away, south and a little east.  i could still see the same movements, but it was too far to record.  as of an hour after my first seeing it, it was still out there but farther and a different color.  we are in the flight path of fighter jets that come from

took, i tried to keep my phone still so you can see that the movement is from the lights, not my hand.  the bright lit up area on the lower portion of the video is the upstairs bedroom light from my

north side of the wapiti river at the canfor haul road bridge at gold creek.\r\n\r\n\r\n  my nephew and i were fishing on the north side of the wapiti river, at the canfor haul road bridge at gold creek. we were on the west side of the bridge. it was dusk, right before 8:00pm, about 25 minutes after the sun had gone behind the horizon, but was still light enough to see clearly for a few more minute. the stars were just starting to be visible in the sky. there were a couple small, high cirrus clouds to the southeast.\r\n\r\n  i was looking directly south from where we were fishing, about 60 feet from the west side of the bridge. above the river bank, at about the same elevation as the first stars that were appearing, i seen a bright white light moving in the sky. i'd say i was looking up about 30-35 degrees.  i could tell it was not a plane immediately. it was brighter than the stars and moving closer to us, heading east-northeast. it looked about the same size as a star at first, but got larger as it got closer. \r\n\r\n  i pointed it out to my nephew and said \"look, a ufo\". \r\n\r\n  it was clearly at a lower elevation than large passenger jets or satellites fly at. i'd say around 10,000-15,000 feet. it did not leave a con-trail. as it got closer, three lights could be seen around the large central light, in an equilateral triangle. a bright white light beam was shining out of the lead small light that was at the front of the object, pointing in the objects direction of travel. the beam was about as long as the object and pointy like a needle, ending in a point not growing dimmer and fading, and  not widening like a search light or flash light. \r\n\r\n  none of the lights blinked or strobed like the marker lights on an airplane. the object was moving on a pretty straight course, heading generally east-northeast, at a constant speed. after a minute or two, it changed course a little, turning a little more north but still heading in a general east-northeast direction. the center light grew brighter, larger and changed color a few times from white to orange-red, to blue and green a few times when it changed course. \r\n\r\n  i said to my nephew \"watch, there will be military jets here in two minutes.\"\r\n\r\n  as soon as i said that, coming from the northwest was a military jet, followed a few seconds later by another identical jet. the roar of the jets was audible when they passed, and the wings and marking lights on the jets were clearly visible. the ufo looked nothing like the jets. the jets were heading on a intercept course with the object. the moment the jets appeared the ufo made it's slight course change. it continued to fly for a while heading east-northeast, but as the jets got close, the outside lights disappeared. the central light changed to red and slowly grew smaller and dimmer, and then disappeared, like it faded out. it didn't fly out of sight or into a cloud. it did not reappear. the jets changed course slightly, heading more south east after the object disappeared. we got in the vehicle and left right then.\r\n\r\n  the light from the ufo didn't blink or flash at all, it just changed color. when it first changed direction and color, it switched from white to orangey-red and grew slightly larger and brighter for a brief instant, then seemed to change to red-orange then to blue-green, then red-orange, then white. they didn't look at all like the marker lights on a plane. from where we were, it looked smaller than the jets. the object moved at about the same speed and at the same
