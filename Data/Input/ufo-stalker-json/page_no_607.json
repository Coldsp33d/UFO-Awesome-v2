hollywood.  on this particular block is a hospital called hollywood presbyterian.\r\n\r\nas i neared the intersection a man dressed in green hospital scrubs ran up to me from around the corner, his arms were flailing for my attention.  he asked me, \"have you ever seen a ufo before? well turn around right now!!\" he ran off to tell group of three people approximately 30 ft. up the block. \r\n\r\nturning around, i was awestruck and couldn't believe what i saw.  flying in the sky was a large, luminescent disc-shaped object that was unlike anything i had even seen.  it was very clearly a shiny metal color with an alternating pattern of chrome and grey on its undercarriage.  at its base was a single pulsating red light.  \r\n\r\nimmediately i knew it wasn't a plane, that was apparent.  drone perhaps? no.  my perspective adjusted and i realized it was a huge disc-shaped object that was flying at a much higher altitude than anything you would typically see.  i also figured it to be moving extremely fast and traveling in a single direction: nw to se. it was without a doubt a ufo.\r\n\r\ni managed to take a few photos. when i was doing this i glanced back toward the sidewalk and saw the same group of people standing 30 feet away. they were witnessing the same thing as me.  all of them were looking up with their arms and fingers pointed to the sky.\r\n\r\nshortly after, the object moved over some buildings and disappeared from my sight.  it all happened over the course of about one minute.\r\n\r\nwithin a week of the sighting, i found a post on a message board describing the same incident.  also, a different person posted a video on youtube of a sighting which to me looked identical to what i saw.  both the board post and the video describe the incidences as occurring near the same time as mine and on the same date.  each one happened in an approximately 4 mile radius of my location at the time.\r\n","distance":"Over One

night sky, even for chicago approx. 10:30pm tonight, i observed an unusually bright object at the lower of east end of the visible constellation star grouping of cassiopeia.  so bright, and slightly orange in tint, at first i thought i was looking at planet mars in the sky, but this was brighter than i've ever seen it?  also, it appeared to \"twinkle\": demonstrate some variation in intensity, perhaps like a star.  fixated on it now, i kept looking at this object and it seemed to be more of a crescent or rectangular shape and i could make out red edges at opposite ends of this object, too. \r\n   it started to drift or move slowly from a stationary position from the star pattern, and then maneuvering to a correcting course.  then i noted the object to make tight circles a few times and then that's when i realized i'm seeing something highly unusual now as its movements were too unorthodox to explain!  i witness all types of aircraft and satellite movement across the skies by the airport, day and night, but this was not behaving like anything i'd be familiar with.  went inside quickly to make two calls - had camera too - i wanted to shoot some video of this object, but i did not.  no time to call out neighbors to see this phenomenon either...  the flickering continued as i was on the cordless phone and the object wobbled, but always moved back to its stationary position while demonstration some light pulsing (not blinking) for several minutes.  \r\n  the object then changed from the bright orange (sodium light-type color) to a dark red (tail-light)? and back again, in one second intervals for about 8 seconds or so.  \r\n    then, a change to all red with an appearance of red at opposite ends connected by a solid red line (barbell)?   the object then proceeded to gradually move off to the northeast (parallel with stevenson freeway path towards downtown chicago) and gaining in velocity and then disappear in that direction accelerating at an high rate of speed....  wow.   amazing seeing something i can't explain!  very exhilrating!     d. melnyk/chicago-midway  oct. 14 11:55pm","distance":"Over One

play the halftime show in the high school pep band for our basketball team when we turned a 90 degree turn on an old country road and saw a creature that was about 4' tall with huge eyes and big ears that came to a point. it seemed to have longer arms in proportion to its body with what would seem to be hands almost touching the ground. i cannot remember if it had a color to it or not. as har as hair goes, i cannot remember that very well either. the ears and the eyes is what was so bizarre and it lookied like it was kind of squatting there. we saw it for at the most 6 seconds but that was enough. i knew the spot well because my girlfriend and i used to park behind a little mound  right where the creature stood. just myself and the other student sitting next to me saw it. the ligh from the side marker in the front of the car is the light we saw it in as we were in the back seat of the car which was a 1970's camero. we both turned to each other and i said, \"did you see that!\" and we then went back and forth describing the thing like, \" it had big ears,\" and then he would say \" yea, and  it seemed like it had some hair on them\" ect...... my friend the driver tore off in a hurry as the tone of our voices were very serious. i was not friends with this student sitting next to me so they knew we were serious. we never talked about it after that.\r\ni have to tell you i was raised in that area and was an avid fisherman and outdoorsman. i was in the scouts with the driver who became and eagle scout. i know every animal in the wild. it was not a gopher, groundhog or anything close. i am now 47 and i can almost see it in my mind. it was watching us drive by. about a half mile away is carbon limestone and there are a lot of quarries we used to fish and drink at. oh, and we had barely had one beer that night. i saw a video about someon who saw something similar called a pukwudghie or something. all i know is what i saw and it was real i swear to you. i can give you the names of the others if you like. \r\n    later in life i had another incident i really don't like to talk about but someone should know. i used to have horrible dreams and my wife at the time used to wake me. after our divorce, i woke up with a burning sensation on my arm. i mean it felt like i had burned my skin. there were 2 sets of 3 scratches on my right arm. i tried using neosporin, hydrodrgen peroxide, and soap for about 15 minutes until it calmed down. i do not wake easily and i watched the scratches welt up and start to bleed. i took a picture of them if you need it. \r\n     i have felt evil before in my life only a few times but that's enough to make believe that these things are evil. that is truely my opinion. i believe they are some kind of nephelim like in the bible. \r\n      good luck on your cause and best regards.

high above the ground. the first thought was that it was a helicopter and realizing that there was no sound emanating from the craft made me wondered, but i dismissed it and when to fuel-up at a
