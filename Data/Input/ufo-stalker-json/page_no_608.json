States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This incident took place in the fall of 1996. i don't know the exact date, but i remember the harvest moon was in the sky. i was 19 years old at the time. \r\nat around 2:30 in the morning a friend called and invited me out to his house. we worked together on evening shift so it was a normal time for us to get together. i lived in a small town called williamstown at the time, and he lived in a town called waverly, about ten miles away across a sparsely populated state route. this state route, 31, has a break in it where route 2 intersects with it. in order to get to my friends house, i had to drive to the end of the first section of 31, turn onto route 2, and after about 20-30 feet, take a left and continue on the other side of route 31.\r\nit was at this intersection that the sighting took place. \r\n\r\nat around 3 a.M., i arrived at the stop sign at the intersection of route 31 and route 2. i pulled onto route 2, and into the turning lane to continue on to the second half of route 31. when i slowed in the short turning lane, directly ahead of me about 100 ft away, and around 20 degrees in the sky, was a very large, black, rectangular object. i brought my car to a stop, and rolled down my window, to get a clear look as my windshield was dirty. there were no lights on this object, and it generated no sound that i could hear at my proximity. it was illuminated only slightly by a few streetlights on the street below and the bright harvest moon. this gave me a very vague outline of the object. it was completely motionless. the body of the object was totally black, besides the outline of the thing, the only way i could discern its mass was its obstruction of the stars behind it. i observed it in this state for approximately 30 seconds, before what i can only describe as a green ball of fire ejected from the western side of the object, which rapidly descended in a diagonal path into the wooded area on the opposite side of route 2, a few hundred feet behind a small trailer park. \r\n\r\nunfortunately at this point i became extremely frightened and drove as fast as i could to my friend's house. i ran to his door and immediately told him what i had just seen. he said that he has seen dancing lights in the area once before and demanded i show him where it was. i agreed reluctantly, and we took his car to the location. the object was gone, the time between my exit from the area and our return was approximately ten minutes. \r\nwe drove around the area, which consists mostly of gravel country roads, thick wooded areas, and small valleys for the next hour or so. about 10-20 minutes after we began our search on these roads, the sky became busy with helicopter and small airplane activity. we saw nothing else of note that night, and i have never encountered anything like this again.\r\nthere is both a local national guard and a small commercial airport located on route 31, about 5 miles away from where the incident occurred.\r\ni have never been able to explain this occurrence, my father, who worked at the national guard at the time, told me it was most likely night maneuvers, and a helicopter from the base had simply fired a flare. \r\n\r\nhowever, i cannot accept that explanation, because the object was clearly not a helicopter. i have never reported this incident other than to my parents at the time, and some of my friends. the reason i finally reported it was because i came across the story of the phoenix lights, and some of the details reminded me of my encounter, and i hoped to see if anyone else in the area might have seen it as well, as there were no other cars on the road at the time but there was some sparse  housing.

1969, it was only a half-day. not sure exactly what time i came home but i'll say definitely close to 12 noon - 1 p.M. still in school clothes, i went to our back yard and looked into the sky, i don't know why but why not? that's when my eyes were drawn up and there it was. \r\n\r\ni was surprised that it wasn't saucer-shaped craft but definitely strange looking. i knew it was a craft pretty quick... i just had a feeling, like stripping away the logistics of what we see in the air, this didn't fit into that frame, plus generating its own force-field to stay in one position without moving and no, it was not a helicopter.\r\n\r\ni was disappointed b/c it was shaped like a barrel. silver/gray metallic, heavy looking, just hanging in the sky without moving...At all. the top & bottom were cylindrical and the widest point in the center, was a little wider than an actual barrel. it was too far away to hear anything, on the other hand, it gave me a weird feeling. \r\n\r\nprobably b/c i'd never seen anything like it & it was a little creepy b/c my mind was decompressing from school and it was noonday, still in school clothes, the last thing i'd expect to see was a ufo if that's what it was but by virtue of the fact that this \"craft\" was in mid air, not moving, intuitively, one ascertains that there's something unusual and i felt it. nothing \"from\" the craft like radiation, just the feeling that this is an anomaly, unusual and witnessing this event is something you won't forget.\r\n\r\nwho on a beautiful, sunny june day would concoct a ufo story after exams? \r\n\r\ni watched for a good 20 minutes and nothing happened. i went back inside for lunch and turned on my favorite radio station out of buffalo n.Y. that's when it was confirmed. the radio station got an onslaught of phone calls citing the sighting. the d.J. was a little ticked and confirmed it was a ufo and told the listeners to stop calling in.\r\n\r\nwhen i observed it, after my eyes glazed over, i took my focus off the craft & looked at it various times. i didn't know what it was going to do, hoping it would, but nothing happened.\r\n\r\nafter gazing at it, i felt it must be a ufo because there was nothing about its character that looked or acted like anything i'd seen in my 18 years on earth.\r\n\r\ni went back inside, listened to music, ate lunch, went back outside and it was gone.","distance":"Over One

our fathers house to get him so clothes. while walking next door i happen to look up and see what looks like what would be a helicopter falling straight from the sky to the ground.                                                                                  \r\n    i told my brother devin to look to make sure that i was really seeing what i thought i was. i said \"do you see that helicopter falling?\", but as soon as i said that it seemed to go straight back up the way that it was just falling down. what initally had made me think that it was a helicopter was the blue light that was blinkning. i noticed that it wasnt blinking uncontrollably. it seemed to not have a certain pattern, also it moved up and down back and forth side to side and diagnally, and the most austonashing thing was how fast it moved and the way the light seemed to blink all the way around it like it was a ball or a spherical ufo that you would see on t.V. \r\n    after about30-35 min of watching this dancing blinking light out of no where i hear my brother devin shout my name, \"kirston look\", i turned to look and as soon as i did i seen what looked to be a white or silver spaceship that had an blinking orange pulsating bright light that seemed to be going towards the other unknown aircraft, but as soon as it got over the top of some trees thats where it seemed to land, out of sight behind the trees across the road from my house. \r\n    after the space ship was out of sight thats when i turned my attention back to what i believed to be an ufo. now not only the round one with the blue and white blinking lights i now saw a right slightly smaller and dimmer version of the 1st ufo i saw earlier tonight. while i was looking all i could do was stand frozen with fear of what might happen next. im thinknig are these aircrafts goning to fight these ships or are they goin to join together to destroy us?, all these and more horrific thoughts ran threw my mind as if all at once. this started at 10:00pm october 13th, it is now 3:00am october 14th the blue and white ufo is still close to the red one but still has not come in contact with each other, although at times the blue one gets close but as soon as it get close enough it shoots back up farther away towards the sky and the small red one blinks and hovers in the same space slowly following the bigger blue one.

states. i'm from a chicago suburb where i first witnessed this. me and my ex gf got home around 3am about 9years ago(sober). we got out of the car and i told her there was a satalite in the sky mount slowly. it looked like a star moving slowly through the sky. we watched for a few minutes and all of a sudden it stopped completely. then got brighter and brighter and brighter. it became so bright that i could see my shadow on the ground. it was right under some low clouds i'm guessing a few hundred feet off the ground. it was a large bright orb with two different bright white lights. the lights above the orb were not as bright as the bottom lights. then the amazing part happened.. it zipped miles and miles to the left and the zipped back past where it started miles and miles and did the same thing 3 or 4 times making this splitting threw the air noise. it then stopped perfectly where it was when it stopped. it stayed there when i called the non emergency number and she said there was more calls about it. it then zipped off into the sky like star trek when they beam into light speed. it left such a long white trail that like fell and faded as time went. it was so long.. i couldn't sleep that night and have been telling everyone this story for years. just recently i seen the same exact thing in broad day light. almost identical except it didn't zip into space it disappeared behind some clouds slowly as i tried to grab my current girlfriend that i'm on the tv show with. except now i live at the top of the west hollywood hills in ca. i'm one of the very top houses and this time it happened it day light on oct 7th 2015. i'm willing to take a lie detector test or whatever i need to do. this is some technolog we have that no one knows about or completely a

towards the top of the mountain just below the snow cap. we were drinking hot chocolate and making smores for the kids around the campfire when my buddy jason suddenly turned and said \"what the hell is that?\" as i turned the direction he was looking, i observed a glowing object rising out of the mountains going strait up. i instantly tried to determine what this object was, but when it stopped just above the mountain tops and started pulsing different colors(red,blue,green,orange,yellow)i didn't know what i was seeing. everybody was mesmerized and all camping activities stopped as we watched the object meander its way higher and higher in the sky until it was over our heads almost strait above us at an unknown altitude. then it stopped, started hovering and the colored pulsing became faster and brighter. then red lights began to emerge from the main object lining up in formation to the left and right of the main object. if memory serves right, about 8 to 10 red objects. as the main object remained stationary and continuing to pulse the rainbow colors, the red objects began to dart about the sky in ways i've never seen any aircraft move. some seemed to be chasing each other, some seemed to go off by themselves flying erratically. they were making hard right angle turns without slowing down, they were going one direction and instantly going 180 degrees the other way. it seemed as if they were playing like children in the playground running around their mother. everyone at our camp was trying to take pictures with their cell phones, but nothing seemed to turn out very good. cell phones weren't that good back then. the only thing we had to see these things better was a pair of binoculars, which we all shared trying to get a better look. this event went on for hours. eventually the red objects returned to formation next to the main object and one by one went back into the main object, exactly as they came out. the main objects light pulses slowed and it began to descend. it descended down to the mountain we were on, and went just behind the top of the peak. i could still see the light pulsing around the mountain top. i had the binoculars and began to walk up and around the mountain toward the light. everyone was saying \"what are you doing? don't go over there dennis!!\" the kids were scared and thought we were going to be abducted, and hid in their tents. i admit i was scared to death too, but the curiosity i felt was overwhelming, i had to see what this thing was. as i rounded the mountain, the object was still there hovering, i stopped and tried to get a look through the binoculars. as i was focusing in, i could see the hull of the craft through the glow, there were no lights that i could see, it was as if the hull itself was glowing. it was silent, no sound at all.I was now within 50 foot of this thing. as i inched closer and closer, every hair on my body began to stand on end. then the object moved further around the mountain just out of my view, and my hair laid back down. i walked a little further bringing the object back in view, my hair stood back up and then suddenly the craft came directly toward me and flew right over my head within 20ft. or so. that scared the crap out of me and i screamed out loud as the object passed over me without a sound. it sped away at incredible speed, disappearing behind the mountains. oddly, the next thing i remember is standing next to the camp fire, everyone sleeping in their tents, and the sun coming up. i climbed into my tent and went to sleep. i don't know what happened, i wont say i was taken because i don't know. the eight of us spoke about it a few times since then, but were scoffed at and laughed at like we were all crazy. eventually we just stopped talking about it. one thing is for sure, what we saw that night changed my life forever, as i'm sure the same goes for everyone that was there. although i don't have any evidence of our encounter, i think about it every single day. i look to the sky a lot more than i used to. i do have nightmares about things that are hard to admit, but its just something i've learned to live with. it felt good to write all this out and share with you guys after not talking about it for so long.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile,

couldn't believe what i was seeing. there was a very large ufo, the kind that people normally see, the round dish with a dome in the center with lights going around the lower part of it, there was three colors but i could only remember the two that i mentioned. it was a bit into the block on 43rd. street not in the center of the two streets. it was almost as wide as the two buildings were on either side of the street. it made no sound it was just hovering and i sure as heck knew something was looking at me i felt it big time and i couldn't stop looking at it. as i said i just kept on talking to the girl and when i felt i could stop looking at it i waved for the girl to come look at it but before she took a step it took off in a downward direction headed towards 42nd. street and it was gone. i have no idea where it could of went but it was gone. i truly feel it would of tried to take me away if i hadn't waved for the girl to look. back then in the 60's i was a weight lifter and

them satellites in the sky since none of them had ever seen one before so they were really interested . at about 10 pm one guy left and another went to pick up his daughter. so me and another guy were talking when i saw a big flash above us like a photograph being taken almost . so i said to my friend what the hell was that and so we were both watching the sky when it happened again and again about 30 to 40 second in between flashes you could never see the object unless it gave off the flash of light which would last for a few seconds and then disappear . the light looked circular and would expand a bit disappear and show up in a different spot but still very close to original spot not in a straight line random all over the place . this happened 14 times that i remember . twice the light was yellowish and once i could see it was emitting some kind of gas or emitting something on the side or back looked like a wind blown cloud that was the same color as the light. after the 14th flash a commercial plane was flying underneath and we never saw any more flashes after that . we tried to take video with cellphone but never got it because it would move and you couldn't see it until it flashed. my feelings are that we saw a ufo . we looked for another hour but never saw anything after that

startled to see 4 large orange star like balls moving across the sky. it was alarming because they were very large and at a low elevation and 4 of them moving in a row. there were no stars in the sky because it wasn't dark yet.There were also at least 2 planes in the sky at the same time at higher elevations with easily identifiable blinking lights.The orange balls of light seemed to be following each other but not in a straight line horizontally across the sky. they were so abnormal and close that i took cover under a nearby tree to observe them not wanting to keep walking toward them out in the open because i was afraid. as i watched the first orange ball of light ascended straight up into the atmosphere out of sight and then the 2nd and the third and the fourth like they were following each other.No one else was walking on the street to see but cars were going by. i was thinking that the planes must have seen them but i don't know they were flying so much lower to the ground than the planes. afterward i felt disturbed and worried about what they were.

drove to work, we usully listen to the radio but not that morning. we drove with the windows down and no radio so it completly silent during the trip. once we reached air cargo rd, just north of the f.A.A, we noticed a round object lower from the fog, the botton had red and blue lights that flashed for a few minutes then it shot straight up, causing the fog to follow it from underneath. the incident took about 5-10 minutes, and afterwards, we looked at each other to make sure that we both witnessed the same thing and then drove as fast as we could to the airport. once there, we mentioned it a few co-workers but nobody else had seen it. i understand it was a long time ago but watching your show tonight made me realize, we are not alone and i am very thankful neither my friend or myself was not harmed. we kept trying to pass it off as a helicopter or little plane but there was no sound, complete silence as it hovered down and lifted off. the year it happend is not certain but i do know it was between the years of 1989-1994, the years that we obtained employment there. i also understand this may not be much to work on but, at least our story(sighting) is known. thank you for all

looking at the stars.  we noticed a craft streaking toward the ground. it was about a mile away and stopped and hovered about 50 to 75 feet above the ground. its lights were flashing and the craft was turning and we were able to look at it through the telescope for a brief time. it stayed visible for several minutes then it streeked off in the same direction it had come from. several minutes later it returned to the same location it had been hovering at. then it streaked off and disappeared.  it was amazing how fast it moved. we believe there was a report in the news paper in fredericksburg several days later that a person had discovered in their travel home that they had lost a period of time and thought possibly they had been abducted.  i'm not sure of the exact date the incident took place but it was in the summer of 1975.  there were five or six of us in our group camping out that night. we still talk about it sometimes and are still amazed at what we saw. i got a real good look at the craft through the telescope but it was moving left and right, turning and flashing its flights.  it was definitely something not of this world.  we were all stunned and could not believe what we had just witnessed but having the telescope gave us a really good look at it.  it was definitely a saucer shaped object. we could see it's  body along with the lights because of the telescope.  it appeared to be 12 to 15 feet in diameter and possibly 8 to 10 feet tall. it appeared to have at least three different colored lights and although it was moving left to right it was also spinning.
