old roughly 1990 we lived in mount washington kentucky near fort knox. i could hear the tanks going off all the time. one night i woke up and saw this object hovering over the middle school football field that was behind our house. it seemed to be staying still but had red green and yellow and blue lights underneath it circling the bottom of it. i woke my mother and we went out into the backyard to see what was going on. it was hovering right overtop of a goal post and was at least 50 yards wide completely circular. now i dont remember going to bed or even going inside i remember waking up the next day. fast forward&nbsp; to 2009 i was stationed at fort knox as apart of the 1/16 cavalry training brigade. another soldier and i were doing squadron detail when we notoced relatively the same thing hovering over a nearby field we knew it wasnt a helicopter or a plane so we decided to take it to higher ups who gave us the number to talk to air control tower on base. we called and they said they werent picking up anything irregular on radar but sent out a leiutinant. when he saw it he immediately started snapping pictures and calling someone apparently having a heated conversation. the next few days we had to give witness statements and were told not to discuss what would happen because no one knew offically what happened. about a week later our 1sg told us in his office it was just a weather ballon. thing is we had seen a weather ballon go up and we both knew this was much much larger. i think maybe something alien is in the vault at fort knox. sorry this was so long. also i dont know of i was abducted or not as i dont have many of the signs of an abductee.","distance":"21-100

bright (i estimated they were led-type lights) red and white flashing lights to the south/southwest.  i went outside to observe.  the lights moved west/east slightly, hovering just above treetop level; i could hear no sound at this point.  my initial inclination was that the object was a drone because it was hovering so steadily; however, when the lights moved to a position behind a distant palm tree, i discounted that it was a drone because, if it was a drone, the size would have to be incredibly large.  i also discounted that it was a blimp as there was no discernable outline of an object - i was simply seeing lights.  i also discounted that it was an aircraft (on approach or otherwise) because the lights were far too bright for any aircraft that i had ever seen (i am a former air traffic controller and flight navigator) and the object did not appear to be approaching/closing in my direction.  moreover, the lights, in the configuration i was witnessing, didn't fit any that i'd seen in my 12 year aviation career.  at some point, the lights began a direct movement toward the east/southeast, remaining just above treetop level all the while.  interestingly, the light configuration and pace of flashing did not change when departing in that direction.  it was then, just after departing, that i heard what seemed to be a pulsating sound, very low in intensity and at a pace of about 2 pulses per second.  the object continued east/southeast and remained just above treetop level until it disappeared at the horizon.

gradually. \r\ni went to jogging, it is one remote street outside the community. it was dark, no street lights over there. at the end of the road a saw stron lights, like lights from a car, a pair of lights just like a car lights, very strong ones. and yes i thought it is a car that is shining the lights on me. they were very strong a persistent and they irritated me so i pick up a stone and throw it towards the light. throw another one i think but no change or reaction. after that i think i went home and that was it.\r\nnext morning on m palm i saw something strange. about 1cm in diameter, ovar scar tissue, young scar tissue (called glomerulous scar tissue, it is still very young and pink-know that because i'm a doctor). i had + lines or like a cross, like made from a scalpel. so imagine it like a circle with a big plus sign in it.\r\nwhen i saw this mark on my hand i was thinking how did that this get there and then the last night event started to be suspicious. the wound healed in 3 days completely. it is strange to heal so fast. no scar at that place.\r\nthat is my story.\r\n","distance":"101-500
