(if i had been holding a ruler at arm's length, it would have moved around 4-5 inches to the right)...And then it seemed to \"fizzle\" out.\r\n\r\ni was totally amazed at what i was watching!.....And then i noticed a satellite running through roughly where the event took place,...I often see the satellites go overhead, and i always watch out for them, and yes, i know they can glow bright when they catch the light from the sun, but this was not a satellite!\r\n\r\nas i stood and watched the area where the light had \"fizzled\" to darkness, my eyes were then drawn to my left,low in the eastern sky to another bright flash! but this was just one slow flash.......And then using my analogy of the arm's length ruler, i would say the next flash happened about 12 inches or more to the right, again in the lower easter sky.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what i witnessed, but it was not a meteor, a plane, a helicopter, a firework, a chinese lantern or anything of that nature....The flashes of brilliant white light were very definite,and the slow dimming was also quite definite.\r\n\r\ni had to rush out to work, and could not stay to see if there was any more activity, but this morning when i returned home, i went on line to see if anything had been reported to the armagh observatory, but alas it had not.\r\n\r\ni hope someone can please tell me what i witnessed last night, but i am sure someone else's eye was drawn to the bright flashes in the beautifully dark, autumn, cloudless sky.\r\ni also hope that somewhere, an observatory has recorded what i saw, because although i have a mobile/cell phone, i am not sure how to take video, and even with that, it was up stairs and i was literally rooted to the spot in case something else happened.\r\n\r\ni couldn't wait to tell someone about what i had witnessed, so thank you for giving me the chance to give in detail what i saw.\r\nit was an exciting event, but with a tinge of creepiness!\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":71441,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":54.4804006,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-10132015-0019","longitude":-6.0434952,"occurred":1444680300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1444752399000,"summary":"Extremely bright light, which dimmed slowly and then lit up again and moved.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"BT27 5NF","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Lisburn","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:4613"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed, Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Red Lion","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"120ct2015: identifed 4 distict crop circles (2 large; 1 med; 1 small in diamond formation)  in field just outide of tree line from home on hill; walk dogs in the area daily and was not there a week ago; took pictures and called mufon.\r\n\r\n130ct2015: awoke 0130hrs to strange pulsating noises and as though something was outside of my second story window; looked out and noticed a bright light coming from the area where i observed crop circles. noticed object on ground level and was scanning with white light; had multiple lights emitting, disco ball like and varied in depth very bright lights; pulsating lights and glitter; pulsating continued. documented my observations on iphone 6 plus as i describe what i saw in action.\r\n\r\nthere were 4 objects total observed; 2 space station star-like hovering in the sky due west and sw bouncing and communicating with lights and pulses.\r\n\r\nwoke up my parents and my mom drove with me as she recorded with my phone in the car as we went to the main road to view the opposite side of the field/tree line where we observed light casting  off of the trees in the woods. noticed the larger craft in the sky very clear above us; bright white bulbs at the top and bottom; vertical/inverted diamond with blueish white, yellow and gold shimmer, pulses and stobes. no aircraft were in the immediate area at this time of night!

not literally, but they don't really think it's anything.  my husband said the ground is just contaminated and i told him, yes it is, and contaminated in what seems to be a perfect circle.  the edges of the circle seem like the grass is trying to grow back, but it sure is taking a long time and it's an \"eye sore\".  there have been no spills or accidents of any kind on our property, as we take good care of the property and are environmentally respectful and safe. this circle is really starting to bug me, but i am more bugged by the fact that family/friends just laugh it off.  i have lived on this property since 95 and don't recall, nor does my husband, anything ever happening to cause this.  the only thing i can think of, and it's only my imagination according to family/friends is one drizzly/foggy evening in winter a few years back i heard something strange.  i was on my back deck smoking a cig and heard what sounded like a low flying aircraft/loud humming sound.  it was dark so i could not see anything, nor did i.  only problem with what i heard was the sound was first heard as abruptly as it stopped.  fog, rain, weather, traffic from the main road, can be deceiving out here in the woods when it comes to sounds, so i dismissed it after that evening, although it really bugged me that evening as i sat and thought about what i had just heard, or lack of what i heard. anyway, the dang circle is still there, and the longer it remains there, the more i am convinced that it's not normal or from here.  i wish someone with an open mind would just come and look at it and test my soil.  the dogs won't even go potty in that area.

ends of the wings. as i got closer the craft appeared to be stationary which i thought was weird for an aircraft of the size it appeared to be. i turned under the overpass to the park and ride to see if i could get some pictures but couldn't see it so jumped over to the fishermans in crab deck parking and noticed it had disappeared. i drive a prius and was on battery with the windows cracked and there was absolutely no noise. if this was a jet or other aircraft i would have expected to hear the engine noise at least. talked to the workers at the crab deck and they saw it as well but they looked away and it was gone. \r\n\r\nthe craft appeared to be 150 feet at least from tip to tip and wings came out of the base a little bit then swept up on a 30 degree angle. brief glimpse i got of
