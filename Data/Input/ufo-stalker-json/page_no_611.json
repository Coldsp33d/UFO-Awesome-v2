constantly trying to figure them out. started out just as bright light that stays lit then goes dim. objects hover then move east, then se, then directly south. they get extremely bright and then dim and move. and repeat as they move. the area in which they move in the sky seems to be limited in an area of about as far as you can open your arms against the sky. as you will loose these objects in about 25 minutes to 1 hr. i ignore objects that just go in straight lines as i chalk them up to jets or satellites. i also ignore objects that just burst one bright light as exploding stars. but if the object moves , hovers and changes direction multiple times i lock in on it. using my plain eyes first then move in with my barska 10x30x50 binoculars. these objects when seen are not moving fast, but noticeably across a section of sky. always seem to find a second or third nearby. use to think they dim out until i got my binoculars on them...They do not they just are much dimmer to see. currently seeing them in north west sky or straight up above me. seen a few this month in north east sky near and passing through the w-shaped constellation cassiopeia. objects seen also on no moon nights as it's easier seeing the sky and tracking them with naked eye and binoculars. these objects are very high up in the sky. at least satellite distance but lower than the stars. but it is hard to judge on that. any avid colorado skywatcher should be able to see these objects and watch them as they get super bright and dim as you can tract them moving across the sky and changing direction quickly as they never really dim all the way out. but you do need binoculars or you will loose them quickly in the night sky as they change direction or hover going super bright then dim. i would love

could clearly see a lit circular (possibly spherical) object with rotating/pulsating lateral red and blue lights.  it was about a three-count pulse.  it was far enough away i could not decipher detailed shape, markings or sound.  but the white light seemed to brighten when either the red or blue light pulsed, lightening up haze around it.\r\nafter a few minutes i realized the object was not on an easterly path towards our home as i thought (like perhaps an aircraft on a straight path).  it came no closer and simply hovered.  'helicopter perhaps?' i remember thinking.; 'an inadviseable nighttime ultra-light aircraft in flight?' maybe.  but then after watching for 15 minutes i decided that, no, this was not a police or emergency helicopter that would be capable of hovering for an extended time.  it just seemed 'strange'-that is, not normal behavior for aircraft in our area.\r\ni was giving this byplay to my husband the whole time.  at one point i heard movement from one of my twins and looked away from the object towards them.  as i looked back the object was gone-leaving no sign in the sky that it was ever there.  i looked frantically around for it in another part of the sky, but to no avail.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":71399,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.387259648719294,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10122015-0017","longitude":-86.87752286339168,"occurred":1444596000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1444659697000,"summary":"Two adults witnessed (from darkened interior house) stationary lights in westerly direction for approximately 15min, no change in direction, speed or location.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":24,"maxtempi":75,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":14,"meantempi":58,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":5,"mintempi":41,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":24,"maxtempi":75,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":14,"meantempi":58,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":5,"mintempi":41,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"47909","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Lafayette, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:4683"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Windsor","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Noticed a fireball object in the sky.  it was bright and firey orange. we watched it fly by and completely disapear withing approxamately 30 to 45 seconds.(much faster than an airplane)  it had no sound.  it also did not have a long tail on it which may have made me think it was a meteor.  as we were all talking about what we had just seen,  we noticed another one that seemed slightly closer but repeated the same path as the first one.  we then compared the speed at which it passed by with that of some airplanes that were also in the sky and it was much much faster.  not even comparable.

(other than the sun obviously). then we saw a hint of red and green lights coming from it. it was very faint thought. then i suggested it may be an airplane, but as we watched it, it seemed to hover. i then told him its a star burning out or something to that nature (i know nothing about the subject but it was way more logical than a ufo). it did seem to get smaller and dimmer and i assumed the guessing game was over and we would go back in. however, as we were watching it slowly fade away, it seemed to \"turn around\" in the sky. the way the lights motioned in the sky, it was like a car making a turn at night with the lights on. it then started to get brighter and bigger. it looked like it was coming right for us. it was so far away though we couldn't make out a shape. it just kind of looked like a star with a faint aura coming at us. then it stopped and just hovered in the sky, as if looking at us. and we were like deer in headlights, waiting for it to move again, but it just sat there. i went back inside not entertained by it anymore. i just thought to myself \"it's something that's either causing an illusion and playing with our minds, or its an airplane. i've seen a couple of those ufo shows. it's always something logical and realistic.\" i am not a believer. \r\n    my fiance' on the other hand was amazed and convinced from the very beginning that it was a ufo and \"aliens\" were watching us now. so, he was walking outside every few minutes to look at it and \"tease\" it with a flashlight. he tried to tell me that it was spinning and moving, but i ignored him and told him he was imagining it and irritating me with all that nonsense. he came in a few minutes later and i asked him to stop trying to justify why it has to be a ufo and i explained to him that it was impossible. there's now such thing. it was ignorance to me.\r\n      about an hour later he decided to go see if it was gone. he stepped outside and immediately stuck his head in the door demanding i come look. i went outside and the light was still there but in a completely different spot. it was still to far away to make a shape but it had moved were you could see it up in the sky as you got off the porch straight ahead and not to the left anymore. i still wasn't amused. i assumed it was rotating with the stars. \"stars move every night, so what\" were my words to him. i went back in. im not real sure how much time had passed but maybe somewhere between 30 minutes to an our later, we stepped outside again for another cigarette. this is where i kind of began to get a little curios... the light was back around the area it was the first time, which was to the left as you step off the porch. i remember thinking \"since when do stars backtrack\". i'm trying hard  now to think of something realistic; at least realistic to me. i was about to jump on google to find an explanation but  as i'm looking at it i begin to notice some movement. i couldn't see it real well at first because right behind my car was a street light and it was making it harder to see what the object was doing. i decided to put my sunglasses on and look to block out the street light. that is when i noticed the movement he was talking about. the way it was moving seemed like it was deliberate, like it wanted to get our attention. i could see the lights bobbing up and down first, then side to side and right back toward me. the was it looked actually reminded me of headlights. then it made a circle. i could see the lights turning and then come back around, as if it were a lighthouse. after seeing an object in the sky moving like this, i began to get excited and nervous all at the same time. i remember saying \"this can't be real\" and smiling from absolute disbelief that i have let some illusion warp me to \"think\" i am seeing this.\r\n    it started moving left to right and up and down as if playing and i swear every movement made me believe more and more this this thing had headlights like a car. i also saw the red and green colors just a little more. the red lights looked like they were on the sides of it much like an airplane except they looked like beams of light and did not flash like an airplane. the green light was strange to me. i barely could see it it was so faint. but what i was able to see looked like it was like a thicker beam. it seemed controlled. kind of like you see in the crazy movies. the object would turn slightly and i could just see a faint green light come on and then off. it would turn again and the light would come on then go off. it looked like it was scanning sections the sky to make sure everything was in place or it may have been searching for something. or it may have been a figment of my imagination. that would make more sense believe me i know.  \r\n   we didn't see all of this in one setting. it was a little chilly so we would watch for a little while and go inside to warm up. every time we came back out it had jumped from here to there, back and forth. sometimes it was a big jump others it was just a little. but always back and forth. it also never seemed to go any higher into the sky or lower. when it would start to fade away it seemed like it just simply turned around and went the other direction. the highest and lowest it got was the small up and down bobbing like gesture it did. \r\n    the real action happened when we were leaving to take him to work. it was short lived but scary for a second. we got in the car to leave around 5:30am. when we were pulling out of the driveway we stopped at the end of it to get one last good look. daylight was coming and we knew we wouldn't see it again. as we were looking, it seemed to fade away yet again. getting smaller and smaller. then all of a sudden the car-like \"headlights\" turned  and there it was coming at us. it was getting bigger and bigger...So big i began to get a little scared so i pulled off. (when i say big i mean the size of the light. please understand i didn't see a definite shape or really good detail of it because it was really far away, it was just extremely bright. the lights and movement are the only detail i could see.)  we kept an eye on it on the way to his work. we wanted to show it to his co workers. as we were driving, i guess it stopped \"coming at us\" because it seemed to go back to it's normal size. it didn't seem so close anymore. we pulled up to his job and was looking out at it, getting ready to show it to some of his friends...But it wasn't moving anymore. just hovering. and it did not move again. as the sun rose, it faded with the stars. i'm sure we will be back outside tonight to see if this mysterious light returns. \r\n         i really hope this makes sense. it is really hard to explain because it's just off the wall to me. i gave every detail as i remember it. i felt like i was writing a science fiction book as i was typing this. i feel crazy for even typing this because i never saw an actual object; i basically only seen lights. if my fiance' had not seen the same thing as me, i would swear i was hallucinating and go to a doctor. i really wish i had videoed it. it was amazing and scary all at the same time. im not sure it would have shown up very well on a video anyways. i could tell it had some sort of shape but it was so far away i couldn't really tell. the lights are what i saw. i imagine what i saw to be like what the three wise men saw when they seen the north star and was following it. that's the best reference i can think of. if this ends up being something \"realistic\" like i said in the beginning i am going to feel so stupid for actually thinking \"maybe...\"","distance":"Unknown","duration":"03:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

clearly see it was actually a rounded triangle, meaning the corners were rounded, not pointed. the object continued from the northeast to the southeast at a quick pace and was quickly out of site. the

to visualize the stars is normal. while he was looking up he noticed two lights that were flashing red/blue (this was a continuous flashing that never changed) and moving in tandem of each other. the movements were very precise. they went up, down, zig-zag, and sideways but always seemed to be in tandem. he brought me outside and i immediately saw the same thing. then i looked a different direction and saw another one. they were not planes, as there was no sound. there also isn’t any plane that could move like they did. then through some of the tree’s we noticed another one. when the objects were not moving but just hovering they had a little bounce or wiggle. if one object was moving a great deal it seemed the others stayed rather still. this went on for about an hour. then they just slowly started getting farther away and disappeared.\r\n     the same thing occurred again the following night on october 11, 2015. the first 2 flashing red/blue lights we saw were in the exact same place, then we saw the third and it was in the exact same spot as the night before. there was less cloud cover this night and we saw two additional lights. these also seemed to move in tandem with each other. total, we saw 5 lights but expect that the single one probably had a tandem partner that we could not see. we watched again for close to an hour. when we went inside they were still there. when we woke the morning of october 12, 2015 at 0500 there were no lights that we could see. \r\n     we tried to obtain video but could not get anything. what we saw is similar to video we found online dating back to 2012/2013 of mysterious lights in the sky. \r\n      we don’t believe in aliens per se. however, something is going on in our skies. we are thinking the objects might be some sort of drone but the fact that is happened the exact same 2 nights in a row is disturbing. i don't think there was any reaction with our feelings other than just curiosity and some mild paranoia wondering if the government is doing something.  \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

was quite a breeze on this particular day, october 2nd, 2015.\r\n   i decided to open up the windows of the first floor of my home, and proceeded to open the back door. upon taking a step outside onto the patio, i took in the beautiful sky, observing some clouds to the north-west, the sun in a south-western orientation. directly to my west, and high up, to the left of the aforementioned clouds, i saw what looked like a star. i at first thought it was a plane reflecting the sun, many fly overhead so it seemed normal. however, after the initial sight of this object, i noticed it didn't move at all. the time was just after one in the afternoon, so i ruled out stars or a planet, as those would be difficult to see, if at all. satellites do not remain stationary, so i ruled this out as well. i was beginning to get anxious, as my camera was on the second floor, so i would need to quickly get it in order to document whatever this could be.\r\n\r\n   i hesitantly ran to my room, after taking one stop in the kitchen to return to view the object, making sure it remained(and possibly getting my last view of whatever it could be). i made it back outside, and to my surprise the object was there, in the same spot. still keeping its star-like appearance, just shimmering up there, i began shooting. i did not have my tripod, so i used an outdoor shelf just to the left of the backdoor. i had to tilt the camera about 70-80 degrees, and shot as many photos as i could, deleting older photos off my cf card. \r\n\r\n   the sighting lasted about 30-35 minutes. i shot from 1:18pm to 1:33pm, with intermittent spurts of prior photo deletion. using my canon 50d camera, and my 70-300mm lens. i had to zoom as far as possible to get a shot, and even still it was only a speck on the frame. what struck me as odd was the fact that after deleting some older photos, i could no longer see the object with the naked eye, instead only through the camera. this confused and frightened me slightly, thinking that whatever i saw, could see me, and perhaps cloaked itself? speculation aside, there are many photos of something.\r\n\r\n   i have been messing around with the raw shots, editing things such as contrast, shadow and sharpness to get the clearest possible image. i have many different types of shots. some show a boomerang shape of light, some show a circle of light surrounded by a halo. i'm not sure what to make of it, and would love someone to check them out and analyze! i have both the raw shots, as well as edited jpegs. in order to observe, the images need to be zoomed in to the max (pixelization is rampant). i also have more than allotted to post, available upon request.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

the sudden i noticed a diamond shaped craft seemingly jump out of the sky/stars and pulsate in the night sky. i immediately felt extremely uncomfortable and thought maybe i caught the tail end of a very bright shooting star as the craft dissapeared, but within 10-15 seconda it reappeared even closer for about 8-10 seconds and grew much larger before skimming up towards the sky even higher. the craft seemed to look like the north star every time it would pulsate/vibrate to a stop before totally disappearing. then every 10-20 seconds it would reappear in a vibrating/pulsating bright glow and literally seemed to be mimicking the north star every time it stopped. it is an absolutely crystal clear night tonight and this experience just occurred a little over an hour ago. it seemed to be super high in the sky, like it was outside the atmosphere and as far away as the stars but it would appear very close at the same time. the craft appeared to be gigantic, diamond in shape that would glow with a vibrating white circular center and white edges that would become almost transparent. the entire event took about 3-5 mins to completely dodge above my roof/house and be out of sight. i felt extremely uncomfortable and still feel uncomfortable and shocked with goosebumps as i type this. during the experience, i saw a second object that mimicked the main object briefly before darting across the sky faster than anything i have ever seen. both objects moved quickly and slowly but faster than anything i have ever seen when they moved around the sky at high rates of speed. i did not see any of the typical man made objects in the sky (planes, satellites, helicopters,) during the experience, but did see them on their normal paths a few mins after the experience ended. i held my hand at during the experience to block the only light in my neighborhood that was on to make sure i had the best view possible and when the second object appeared my hand felt warm like i was holding it up to a distant fire or welders torch. i have never seen anything remotely like these objects in my entire 30 years and never felt the way i felt during this experience in my entire life. i still feel very uncomfortable and awkwyrd. i thought that there had to be an explanation and looked up online what did i just see in the night sky!? the space station website showed up and i filled out the information on my location and time and it was nowhere near me. i could not find one video online that even resembled what i saw and experienced and i felt overwhelmingly compelled to somehow report this experience. i work in a church and want to remain anonymous but had to share my experience. please offer any help, explanation, or insight that you can if possible. thank you for your time.
