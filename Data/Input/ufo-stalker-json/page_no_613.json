appeared to be a plane or jet at first. but then i noticed it wasn't high enough or moving fast enough, to be either. as i watched it i didn't see any wings or a tail. it appeared cylinder or cigar shape as some would say. if i had a ruler and knew how to measure heights. i would say it was a foot long but then the more i looked at it the  more it looked bigger about 50-100 ft. maybe..Considering the height. i can not say. but i know if it had landed it would of covered at least a good 50+ft maybe more. the more i think on it the more i picture it in my mind. i say it could of easly covered 2 1/2 - 3 blocks. it was silver in color but it did not reflect the sunlight..Even tho the sunrays were directly on it.Would of reflected off of it. the sun was bright enough that i could see it was silver in color..And it was low enough where i could see it had no windows ,because the sun was hitting it directly and there was no reflection it was a solid silver object..But as i watched it i did see a reflection like something was on top of it. a little to the left of center. the reflection was not all along the side. but just in one spot.Even tho the object side was facing the sun. the object itself still did not show any reflection at any time. imagine chrome colored ink pen and u shine light on it and hold it flat not upright..As if to write. then shine a light on it.. u can see it has no reflection but u can see it appears silver in color all along the side. there were no other colors just a solid silver or chrome appearance..Now to the left of center on top u get a reflection not from the side but from on top of it. like if u would hold a piece of tin foil so the sun would shine on it. how bright it would appear from say 50' and then multiply that light say by 7 times. give or take. that's how bright the reflection might appear.Then multiply say a 2'x2' square piece of tinfoil...7 times that..Giv or take..Its hard for me to explain...I am not good at

with me when we say it.\r\nwe were on our way home from her boyfriends house about 10:30 at night, we were going north on catherdral oaks rd in goleta ca.  we noticed a light coming from the foothills to our right. this was really strange because there isn't anything out there except ranches, orchards and we later found out an electrical plant. i was about 17 and had grown up in goleta and i never knew there was an electrical plant back there. we first noticed it when we were about one mile from glen annie rd where we were going to make a left hand turn to go home. because there is nothing but ranches and orchards out there and no street lights it is dark, but i remember it was a clear night with lots of stars, so the light we saw really stood out. it was coming towards us but traveling above glenn annie rd from the hills. i was the first one to see it and pointed out to my bestfriend, neither of us knew what it was and i don't think neither of us really wanted to say what we thought it was, a ufo.  when we got to glenn annie to make our left turn this thing got there at the same time we did.  my bestfriend wanted to stop and check it out and i made her go. it hovered right above the eucalyptus trees and followed us for a couple of seconds. it was so low it felt like we could have touched it. then it was just gone, it went straight up and within seconds it was gone. on the rest of our ride home we were trying to figure out what we had seen. we went through a list, helicopter, plane, you name it we were thinking about it, everything but a ufo.  we decided that it had to be a ufo and we decided never to tell anyone about it. by this time we were both pretty shock up.  it scared me so bad that when i got home i went into my mom's room woke her up and slept with her for the next week.  i really thought they were going to come & get me. when my bestfriend got home she called me and we talked about it more. my mom checked with some people she knew that were in the air force and stationed at vandenberg afb and they hadn't heard of anything. they also told my mom that they see them a lot out on base. \r\n\r\ni forgot to describe it.  it was disc shaped and it had a white color light on the bottom until it started to leave then it turned a warm red color. it seemed like it was going to follow us.  it stayed right with us until we got to where we could see the lights from the gas station.\r\n\r\nbefore this happened i really never gave ufos any thought but now i think about them a lot and when it's clear outside and we can see the stars i'm not only looking at the stars but looking to see if i see anything else flying around up there.  i really truly believe that people will not believe they are real until they actually see one and then some of them are going to try and explain them away, it's not that easy.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

star like thing was. i have an iphone so i thought i'd take a video. in the video it just looks like a star not moving and that's why it's not included but if u want it i got it. anyway while i'm filming this thing i look up through a big hole in our trees and i see what looks kinda like a red star shoot out two objects with orange and blue lights. i couldn't tell if they were orbs or solid craft. i tried to video them but the film is just dark. they traveled away from the red star like a plane would but one was right behind the other. now if this isn't weird enough, i do an ancient practice called sun gazing. i go to a properly next door and down by the lake to watch the sun. it's 7:47 and i'm waiting for the sun to come up. i start seeing these lil flashes of light in the sky. kinda like when you're seeing spots or about to pass out but i was outside wide awake and felt fine. so i started to think.... are these far away? am i creating them? then i just focused my eyes and suddenly there were 50-100 fly sized luminous orbs floating around my body. some stayed floating around me for 10 min or so but others were like blinking in and out of reality. i had no idea what to think of this. they just looked like little intelligent balls of light. i tried to grab one but my hand went right threw it and it kept floating there. then after 10 min or so they just all disappeared. i don't know if all these events are related but it was one of the strangest mornings of my life. also 6 months ago i saw an orange ball of light 150 feet away from me across the road at the tops of the trees. this thing was super bright about the size of a basketball and u could see it had structure and energy or something swirling inside of it. about a block from where today's

in the sky near the airport. this is not uncommon, but the lights themselves were! i compared them to what were obviously planes coming and leaving from slc airport, and noticed several differences, which lead me to conclude that these might be ufos.\r\n\r\nthe lights in question were absolutely stationary. there was not a strong wind at the time, but planes do inch along in the sky, and there were conventional aircraft doing just that. the navigational lights of the planes were strong and steady, while the unknown lights i was witnessing scintillated like stars. the radiation of their lights was inconsistent; they pulsated rhythmically, and seemed to alternately glow very bright and get larger, and then diminish in luminosity and size to the point of disappearing. then they may – or may not – reappear! \r\n\r\nthese ufos just hung there in the sky above the airport absolutely still while passenger planes came and went. i didn’t think to count them at the time, but i now estimate there were between 5-8 such lights positioned at various points in the sky. some were as far east as to be visible in front of the mountain range just north of the city, while others were much further west. the westernmost light was observed to get very low to the horizon in a slow, vertical descent, which made me wonder if it was landing! there was the main grouping of lights, which formed a line of three in a diagonal. \r\n\r\nfor the most part, they just seemed to hang there in the sky, with the exception of the one that moved down slowly toward the horizon. i had to park my car at work and go in to start my day, but i did snap four pictures with my old school “dumb phone”, but even with computer enhancement later i can detect no trace of the ufos. in one photograph, i believe the descending ufo may be visible, but i cannot be certain. my photos reveal nothing, but even if they had, they would just be pinpoints of light in the sky above an airport; so what? the lights my eyes saw, however, were twinkling like stars, pulsating and changing in brightness. they were absolutely stationary.\r\n\r\ni feel fairly certain that i was witness to an early morning display of extraterrestrial craft over salt lake city. then again, they could have been something sent up by hill air force base, but they certainly caught my attention because of their odd qualities and behavior. \r\n","distance":"Over One

the perimeter of the object. and the whole of the object was lit in a brilliant white light that pulsated, but not blinked.\r\ni decided to get my game binoculars and my cell phone to study it further and take a photo (unfortunately my cell phone camera takes a poor picture.) using the binoculars i found that the object was stationary (and remained so for at least 45 minutes), but for one of the
