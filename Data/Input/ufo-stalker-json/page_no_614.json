night. we had never observed anything that we couldn't explain until about 6 weeks ago. we were leaning on my car, watching the stars, and an orb appeared about 500 feet to my right, that drifted slowly northwest, then disappeared. it was only visible for about 3 seconds. i yelled \"what the hell is that\" to my boyfriend, and he didn't see it because it disappeared to fast. i told him to get in the car, and that i wanted to go home. he made fun of me, and told me it was probably farm equipment or a shooting star.  the next night, we decided to go out to the same place in the wheat fields to watch the stars again. i was curious to see if anything would appear that night, too. about a minute after we got there, an orb appeared over the wheat fields, slowly moved east, and then hovered over the ground for about 2 minutes, then disappeared. my boyfriend witnessed this one, but was still skeptical, and still tried to explain it away as being \"farm equipment.\" we decided to drive further down the road to another location. we stopped about half a mile away, and another light appeared less than 100 yards away from the car, hovering over a small hill. it didn't move, but disappeared after about 30 seconds. this is how our fascination with the \"lights\" in the sky near our house began. since then, we have observed strange lights almost every night we've gone out. there are ones that appear like the lights described above, but there have been other strange occurrences happen recently too. we observed a \"fuzzy\" appearing star-like light in the sky that slowly moved from north to south, would stay stationary, then move west, east, then continue south. i commute 30 minutes to work each day, and when i come drive home around 9 pm, i have seen other strange things in the sky. i have seen strobing lights that move slowly across the sky. they don't look like lights from a plane. a few nights, i've seen 3-4 of these types of lights while making the 30 mile commute home from lewiston, id, to moscow, id. i have also seen a quick flash of light from the sky that disappears in less than 1 second, and then a few seconds later, another flash will occur in a different part of the sky. i've finally decided to take to the internet to try and see if anyone else in my area has also been seeing these things. the strangest one that happened, was literally right outside my house in my driveway. we had rented a movie and were returning home, when we saw one of the \"strobing\" lights in the east sky right before we turned onto our street. when we got home, we got out of the car, and i saw a light in the west sky that appeared to be about 200 feet up. it was slowly coming towards. i pointed it out to my boyfriend, and we watched as it literally came straight towards us. as it got close to us, it started to dim, and completely disappeared right as it was overhead. we are both working professionals, don't have any history of mental illness, and don't use any substances.  the only other time i've seen anything similar to these lights was as a teenager in spalding, id. my family and i saw some lights one summer that would move back and forth in the sky, and would split into 2-3 lights, then reabsorb back into one light. that was at age 14, and i'm now almost 28. i've literally seen nothing weird since that time until 6 weeks ago. if anyone else in the area has seen these lights, i'd love to hear about it. i'm now fascinated with them, and want to know what they are. feel free to leave me your contact information. i do have some videos of some of these occurrences, although they're poor quality cellphone videos.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

los angeles, ca. i have a clear and unfettered view of the clear blue skies in and around my home.  my adult daughter (university graduate summa cum laude criminal justice)) and myself were sitting on my deck outside of my home. absolutely clear blue skies, no clouds, slight breeze, no haze, and no adverse weather conditions whatsoever. as we were talking we were watching the commercial jets above that were cruising by some from 12,000 to 30,000 plus based on the con trails.  i happened to look straight up, and i observed a unique looking shinny object tear-drop shaped ufo hovering approximately 12 + thousand feet above.  it appeared about the same size as a commercial aircraft and about the size of a dime.  (very difficult to determine the exact altitude but appeared as large as a commercial jetliner)my daughter joined me in the observation…a neighbor across the street said hey ….”is that a ufo” confirming our observation. i grabbed two sets of high-end binoculars. we all clearly observed the hoovering silent craft. it was a shimmering gold color with a slight minor haze as if was vibrating or giving off some energy.  it was shaped like a tear drop, a pointed nose and a rounded aft. with the binoculars i could clearly see the entire perimeter of the craft and it had darker edges than the rest of the craft, the darker edges also were shimmering.  the simmering effect resembled that of a desert heat mirage.  we all watched this ufo for about 45 minutes….It was not party balloons! it was not a weather balloon! it was not a helicopter! it was not a stealth bomber, it was not a plane or harrier jet. it was not a bird... it hovered.....Then after about 45 minutes of our observation, it moved slowly to the west and at that time my daughter and my vantage point lost sight of the ufo in the tall pines.  at my neighbor’s vantage point he observed the ufo to hover for the entire time and he said that he seen it depart instantaneously…..It was there then it split to the west as a mere faint streak....Poof! gone...  no further details.   \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

long stretch of road not too far from our home on our way to a family members. there was moderate traffic and people walking around and i looked out of my top left corner of my front windscreen and saw a jet black triangular object about the size of a golf ball high in the sky about the height that planes fly i thought it was some kind of plane at first but it was still or almost still in the sky. as soon as i laid eyes on the object began moving in the opposite direction to which i was driving. i then shouted to my wife \"look what is that!?\" and she could not see it at first and as soon as she spotted it the object instantly changed direction and also at the same time began to morph into different shapes from disc to sphere almost pulsating in between the transformations and began flying along side our vehicle whilst it was still at the same height. i pulled over and got out my phone to record it and it began to hover above my car staying around my area and as i tried to record i hit the picture button i took a picture by accident and i got a picture and as i slid across to change to video mode my screen on my phone went black and my phone was unresponsive for at least 1-2 minutes and when my phone came back on the ufo was no longer in sight. during the sighting me and my wife were very excited and at the same time shocked and amazed close to the end of the sighting we began to feel very dizzy and nausious. i carried on my route to the family members house which led through a wooded area and there was an opening in the trees where my wife then saw a classic flying saucer shaped obect with bright lights and a highly reflective surface the lights were  all the way around it i did not see this ufo but when we came to another opening in the trees my wife lost sight of it. at this point my wife was just in absolute shock and she was abit nervous. we then saw a large black or dark plane flying by we were unsure if this was a military plane or not. i have include two pictures of the object one is fully zoomed out and the other is fully zoomed in.\r\nthanks for your time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

my aunt said that birds really do not fly at night. she also said that if i wanted to see a ufo, just to talk to them mentally and ask them to come back. so i did this. i was just shooting random pictures in the direction that the shadow went. at the time of this event i had a sony phone, that is what i was using while taking pictures. i did not have a digital camera. i was using different apps on my phone for night pictures. i continue shooting all the pictures i could that night.  the next day my aunt uploaded my pictures onto her laptop and this is the picture that i caught on my phone. she has a picture that she took maybe about 2 to 3 years back, it was a night shot. in her picture there was a shape with lights, upon zooming in she noticed a ufo also. it has the same shape has this picture of mine. she put her picture in negative and you can see the shape really well. i'll send a copy of her's has well. my reaction to this picture was totally shocked. i never would have

about 30km behind us my brother inlaw drove in his car. out of thin air just south of ottawa a strange triangular/rectangular object appeared on our left side, flying and accelerating fast downwards towards the ground. it had 6-8 green sharp lights with a red one above the middle of the center of the green lights. it seemed to be flat in shape as it rotated slightly towards the ground, like a falling leaf. against the illuminated background of ottawa lights i could determine a dark solid surface, as if the lights were attached to this surface, seeing it from below.\r\n\r\nthree people observed this from two different cars, car behind us was about 30km behind. he reported that he saw it as a fast moving green light on his left side. i estimate the speed was 200 km/h and size at least 15 metres from back to tip. we travelled about 100km/h and the object flew about twice that speed. the whole experience lasted only 5 seconds. \r\n\r\nwe were both amazed by what we'd seen. never scared just totally fascinated by this as we never seen a ufo before. i am pretty sure it was not a plane, but possibly a military drone or atmospherical phenomena. but deep in my mind i think this was something else. it's been some days since we came back to our country but i couldn't stop thinking about it and started googling and finding this site, deciding i had to report

it seemed still but when i looked at it closely, i noticed that it was slowly moving. kind of like a slight hovering movement. at this point i was really freaked out and a dull static noise began to grow in my ears. it was getting to the point where i looked away and rubbed my ears to soothe them (due to my autism, i have sensitive hearing). after the static died down(maybe around 20 seconds or so, i looked back up at the sky and the orb was on the other side of my peripheral vision. i ended up getting really spooked, so i ran back inside. unfortunately, i didn't have a camera or phone with

immediately saw the craft and the orb. the craft was lower than the orb and was emitting light pulses to the orb. i took my phone and snapped a picture. you can see the craft and the light pulses going up but you can't see the orb. the next thing i know i'm waking up on my couch and i thought to myself that i dreamt the sighting. i remember taking the photo so i grabbed my phone and the picture was there. i was sick to my stomach and felt warm all over my skin was red. i felt a feeling of doom.\r\nnow i'm coming forward for the first time in my life because i need serious help. i've been being abducted since age nine. my first experience with abduction was in late summer i was nine years old playing worth my best friend in the woods by her house. we were exploring and found to dead baby horses. i remember they had parts cut off them but there was no clear reason why they should be dead. no injuries.. nothing. we got really scared and next i remember my hair got all staticy and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. then we saw this metallic silver orb perfectly round and it looked totally solid. and this orb was hovering above us and we started running for our lives. next thing i remember is waking up on my friends bed and she was also next to me. we said nothing to each other until years later when we reunited and i asked her if she remembered the orb and the baby horses. she said yes it was real and it happened. \r\nover the years i've known something was happening but never remembered what. however, i couldn't deny that when i lost time something always appeared on my body. a cut, a mark and scars that appeared from nowhere. note for the last three years i've suffered so much with lesions that won't heal and strange things that come out of the lessons. sometimes strange living creatures. i know this sounds so crazy but it's true. my hair texture has changed and i find weird structures in my hair. intricacy in knots and strange black hairs that move and my hair acts as of its alive as well. i have proof of all this as i've documented and have numerous samples of the strange structures that comes out of the lesions as well as strange scabs and fibers that move. i know this sounds crazy but it's not when you have proof.. and i do. i'm coming forward now because i'm scared as my health is starting to be effected and i feel far older

ave. in the town of bridgeton new jersey. it was in the early evening thirty minutes before dusk. as we were sitting on the front step talking i happened to look down the street and noticed the object that was passing very slowly over the roof of the bridgeton hospital which was about 3 city blocks from where we were sitting i qiuckly said to my friend nelson what is that! as i pointed at the object to nelson my brain was quickly trying to identify it i said its not a plane  because it had no wings, its not a helecopter no blades. its not a blimp. it was no more than twenty ft above the hospital roof. moving so slowly. we were so excited that  i said to nelson lets go to check it out. we immediately jumped off the steps ran out the yard and down the st. towards the object. as we were running as fast as we could towards it i could clearly see it was a ufo silver in color. and round disc shape. as we were running towards it i could see that it was turning in direction slightly and if we continued running down irving ave that we we miss it directly so i estimated that in order to get a closer look at the ufo i would have to change directions and start running up another st named church st. i did that and got about a quarter  block up the st. then i decided to stop and wait to see the ship fly over me. as soon as i stop i looked up and it appeared as luck would have it i was now directly underneath  the ufo as it slowly moved no more than 20  to 30 feet above the houses roof tops. i was amazed because it made no sound nothing. it was matalic  silver in color with multi colored lights under it that were not blinking at all. it was so close to me i remember saying i could have  it it with a rock. i was only 20 years old at the time along with my friend nelson.I distinctly remember thinking that it was heading in the direction of the salem 1&2 nuclear power plant which was only about 20 miles or less away from were we lived at the time.The interesting thing about this is because my friend nelson and i have kinda both moved on with our lives and not been in touch that much, i really love to talk with him about that incident to see and compare our story about what we both saw that day back 1980. to this day i feel so lucky in my mind knowing that i personally witnessed seeing a ufo! and i am very content knowing that we are not alone.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional

than side to side, atleast from my angle. it was flashing red yellow and white lights randomly and very bright, not blinding bright but too bright for a plane. then is started to move south however it stopped flashing yellow, it dimmed reddish and then started flashing white and reddish. it was flashing in pattern after it started moving. i lost sight of the object when it went past my house over the room that i could see from my room. also when it flew away it wasnt super fast but it was fast. towards the end of it being in my sight a plane more north and higher was flying and they looked similar but not identical the ufo just seemed off. i know what planes in the sky look like and there was something different about this object . i immediately called my friend after i couldn't see if anymore and she didnt answr. i was scared and nervous because i've never seen something like this and i didn't know what to expect. i couldnt tell anyone in the house because they were all

outside during a fire drill.\r\nwhile walking, i saw my first ufo. it was descending, quickly, and it looked like an silver extremely reflective oval. it was not an airplane, because it was wingless, quiet, and didn't leave a mark in the sky. my sister witnessed it as well. it then ducked under the trees and we couldn't spot it anymore. \r\nthen, while we were all in lines, i spotted the second ufo. it looked like the first, except was red on one side and blue on the other. i looked away and i couldn't spot it anymore.\r\ni kept asking my classmates what they thought it was, and all of them annoyed by my persistant asking and excitement, didn't answer. of course, i got the normal responses of \"it's probably just a plane\" or \"drone maybe?\". one girl suggested it was the rocket that was launched by nasa in virginia, but it very clearly wasn't that because it didn't leave streaks in the sky. it was too high up to be a drone as well.\r\nthe last one, was the most frustrating. it was a red wingless object, but with the tail of an airplane. it didn't make streaks in the sky and didn't make a noise, so i knew it wasn't an airplane. if it was an airplane, we'd hear it because of the altitude of the object.\r\nit was very reflective. i saw it during the fire drill, but then lost track of it. while walking back inside, i spotted it again.\r\nthen, later, for theatre class, we were sent outside to practice our pieces. i spotted the red object again. it was come from the right side of the sky, and would disappear in the middle. i saw it repeat these patterns 4 times, continuously telling the people around me.\r\nthey all thought i was crazy, they couldn't see it. until finally, they all witnessed it the last time before we came inside.\r\nthey all started to believe me, since it came from the exact direction i told them and disappeared in the middle of the sky. \r\n\r\nfor all of the ufos, there were multiple witnesses. it's hard to tell how many since the whole school was outside, and who even knows how many people even looked at the skies during it. it was very strange.\r\nunfortunately, i didn't have my phone with me during the drill, so i couldn't take pictures.\r\ni am praying that other people saw these objects and i'm not being delusional.
