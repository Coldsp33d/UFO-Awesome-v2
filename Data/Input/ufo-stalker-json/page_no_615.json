flyingtt airtctraft.  i live several miles away from harrisburg international airporo  but the planes coming and going from there typically follow a northwest totraveling  southeast route from the airport or vice versa.  this aircraft was extremely low and emitted a differ sound from what i hear from most aircraft.  it was more of a loud humming sound. the aircraft sounded that low that i truly thought it was going to crash into my house and another thing i noted is that it seemed to move so slowly.  i wish i would have gotten up to look out my window but i didn't.  this happened at 12:55 am.  around 2:00 pm, i got up to use the bathroom and when i walked out of my bedroom, i noticed a flash of light and i turned and looked into my living room.  there is a picture window in the living room and i could also see out of my dining room windows.  i looked across the living room and there were numerous bright flashes of light that completely covered the window on the east side of the living room.  i would estimate these flashes lasted around fifteen to thirty seconds and they were very bright and there was no sound emitting from them.  the best description i can give is that they were bright white to silver flashes.  i recall standing there watching what was happening and i had no clue whatsoever as to what was going on.  i remember looking towards my picture window and my dining room window and there was nothing there.  after this all happened, i went back to bed and i just laid there trying to understand what had just happened.  the next day, i called a neighbor who lives about a quarter mile down the road and he said he saw and heard nothing.  i've seen many strange things during my lifetime but never anything close to what i saw that morning.  it wasn't until the day after it happened that i started to associate the aircraft incident with the lights and that's when i decided to contact someone to find out if anything like this has ever been reported before.  please tell me i'm not crazy.  sorry, i just went up to the beginning of my report and tried t add some comments but for some reason, it just messed up my statementi hope you can offer some explanation for this totally bizarre incident.  thank you.","distance":"20 Feet or

reddish orange fire ball dropped out from below the main object and just like that at atom splitting speed at the same exact fraction of a second the main craft shot north in a straight line and the fire ball shot straight opposite direction at this point i lost site of both objects. i was stunned. i noticed the dogs were already in the house i went in the house and told the family i saw a real

october 2002-2003. we live in the country, the driveway to our house is a mile long with woods on both sides of the road. it had been raining  all afternoon. we were driving down the driveway,rain pouring down, poped over the little hill and seen over to the left right in the tree line a bright fireball bought the only way i can explain it.  it was red,orage,yellow glowing,it looked to be about 1-2 foot of the ground hovering in one spot.  we all saw it, we all were like what is that at first i said someone must have started a fire, but then who would do that considering it had been raining  most the day heavy rain  for a couple of hours and it was  my property. i know  i felt  scared i had my cousin stay the night with me, there was no way i was staying home  alone. the last thing of that night i remember  is getting out of the truck running to  my house locking the door. everyone in the truck was confused  at what we were seeing.  the next day my step-dad  and cousin went to check out the spot were we saw it, they said that they didn't  see anything not even a burnt place if someone had started a fire . that's my story to this day i still am trying to figure out what  we saw that night.

they all headed in the same direction behind the trees where the sun was rising all heading that way  some reflected the sun on one side as you can see in the pictures. once i looked back on the pics i noticed a purple blob in quite a few pics but that could be lense issues i'm not an expert i don't know what it is but i couldn't see it in the pictures when i was taking them i said at one point it

flash in the sky several times as it changed direction and started to move in a southerly direction. we watched it flash intermittently for a few more minutes then hadn't return to the house to go to bed. i frequently observe satellites overhead and the move at a much more rapid pace than this object moved. there were jets in the sky at the same time so we could differentiate between them and the object. there were also several meteors near the object so we could tell it seemed to be at an altitude comparable to satellites. i wasn't sure if it could be a satellite making controlled burns to change course or what but was really strange to see it maintain a steady position for as long as it did.I knew i needed to get witnesses to confirm that i  was seeing what i was seeing and thankfully
