i've been pursuing and haunting by ufo. i've been living different types of events with aliens. it was in 1994 when the first time i saw a flying red light ball came to the treetop of my house in haiti with a powerful light. all my family was witness of that first event. and while it flew again, struck against something, it made a strange noise and its light turned off and disappeared. and so many amazing things i lived in my life. four years after, my family moved to another house. when it was like 9:30 pm, i was in the yard of my house listening to the music and observing the stars as usual when suddenly appeared a strange flying object. at first sight i thought that was an airplane. i didn't pay too much attention to it. but when i saw it stayed too much time in the air without moving and silently. that the way i could imagine that wasn't what i thought. it was a round white object with many triangular windows all around it by which i could notice the reflect of yellow lights as a steam. when i said it's not an airplane. it moved with a such speed that it disappeared like lightning. i felt astonished and a little worried about that at the same time. i wondered why they were observing me? and why after being noticed them they had decided to go? since then i had begun to see different types of aliens in my dreams; giving me pictures of them which i drew in a paper what i had seen in that dream when i've been woken up on that morning. i attached this drawing so that you can see what he looked like. \r\nin other dream i had too, they would like to take me with them. nevertheless in 2007 i left haiti to come to live alone in dominican republic and to study medical science; and in 2010, 11 years later the first events that i lived in haiti, an alien had come to my apartment at 1:00 am. he was outside of the window with his arm inside of the bathroom. when i saw him he hid a part of his face but his arm was stayed in. i stared at him without fear. he looked a good one. it seems he wanted me to shake hands with him cause his arm was still staying extended till he pulled it out. a few seconds after he left mysteriously. but he was exactly that one i used to see in my dreams before and that i drew in the paper. so after he left i was a little scared. i couldn't even turn off the light to sleep! i couldn't believe that i came to see an alien! i felt so strange! i asked myself who am i to get visited by an alien? so what he wanted from me? in 2014, i had another dream, \"i saw men in black in limousine came to my house and look for me. i tried to get away from them and they caught me anyway then they said to me: \"you cannot escape from us; you got something inside of you who belongs to us, you are one of us\". and then they disappeared\". when i woke up on that morning the palm of my right hand was all green color like a leaf of a tree. i washed my hands, nothing! so scared of what was happening to me! i went to some friend's house to show my hand. they couldn't help then worried. three hours after my right hand was normal without i realized it. the dreams say the truth sometimes. i can't understand this phenomenon! can i please have any explications in that case? thank you!

5, 2015, we observed a brilliant stationary light 30 degrees above the horizon approximately 45 degrees left of our course on the interstate.  the sun had just set when the object appeared.  we observed that it was a spherical light in a stationary position for five minutes.  it was far brighter than two airplanes that were flying overhead on an easterly path at almost the same time that we saw the object.  there were no stars visible in the sky, as this was just at sunset and the sky was still very bright.  the object was larger than any star or planet that we had seen in the night sky on the previous night.  we pulled off the highway to observe the object, and retrieved our binoculars.  while i was retrieving the glasses, my wife noted that the object changed shape, increasing in size, elongating and seeming to develop a veil-like shape, so that it resembled a filmy rectangle.  the color was yellow-white.  with the field glasses, i observed the object rise in a straight line at a rapid velocity, and change from a pulsating/rotating white/yellow to bright orange, as it decreased in size.\r\nwhile i was observing this, the object vanished. it didn't disappear into the distance - it simply vanished, like a switch had been flipped.  the entire event lasted approximately 10 minutes.  we waited for a couple of minutes in wonder and tried to assess what we had seen, and comparing the relative size to the planes we had seen that had flown on eastward.  this object was  much larger than those planes had been.  we drove on, and saw nothing more...","distance":"Over One

wat looked like a plane to the west of my house bout mile or so away what seemed to be a plane but this thing was not moving at all had 2 lights spread apart from where i could see with a kinda flat shape between the 2 i'd say green lights.  then i looks to the south and saw two crafts with fast blinking lights going toward this one that was jus sitting there. so im watching back and forth with my binoculars which was difficult having trees in way on the path the other 2 were coming from.  well when the 2 got behind a tree one one emerged toward the one jus floating then as it got closer the one not moving started headin north for sure maybe nort west with one that looked to be kinda under it but was definitely following it. then i finally noticed where the 3rd one was it flew rite over my neighbor hood going east with wat looked to be a triangle shape of lights flashing and it wasgoing very fast not like u hear about like pole to pole in seconds but in my binoculars i could see a smoke like trail behind the one that seemed to guide one to the stationary one.  the other 2 jus kept going and eventually i lost site.  i jus thought it was to strange for airplanes to what seem to be a guiding of someone to a airplane that isn't moving at all then when does start going the lights blink like a plane jus fast but planes also do that and one of the 2 others follows it. please tell me what i saw this was at least a minute in cass county missouri in the belton/raymore area and was over im guessing 430 am. course no phone with me dang it. i mean maybe it was a exercise of sum sort i would like you all to check radar in the cass county area around 420 am to 435am thanks.","distance":"Over One
