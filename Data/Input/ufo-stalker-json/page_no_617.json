as i continued observing this very bright star looking like object. it continued moving up & down at truly such fast speed that it could not have been a drone or any type of manufactured airborne object from the planet earth. i watched it moving in a manner that was not consistent with anything that i had any ability to explain. it varied from very precise right & also left angle trajectory flight. once again, all movement that i saw were all occurring at lightening fast speed and beyond that specific description of truly jaw dropping speed in sync with perfect avionics. the kind of super accurate movement and motions that were unlike any traditional aircraft i had ever observed, prior to this specific event. i did not have the ability to accurately know how large this object, aka ufo was/is. beyond it maintaining it's consistent brightness. it was not pulsating. it was not changing it's size or the amount of star like bright white light that i was observing from what i in a conjectured manner of thought. possibly believed that this object was anywhere from twenty miles away from my home. upwards of it very possibly being hundred's of miles away from my home location. if it was very far away. that caused me to wonder about what the true and accurate size of this, not of this earth, flying object truly and honestly was. i do not own a telescope. i own a pair of high power binoculars. i did not want to search for them in the main part of my home. with great concern that if i stopped intently observing this most unexplained flying marvel in the early morning sky above whiting, nj 08759 at 3:00 am edt until 3:25 am edt. everything that i have communicated above was done so in an ethical and honest manner. i did not add or exaggerate anything relative to my honest observation that i have shared above. i would love to know exactly what it was that i was actually observing. fyi: my home is a fifteen minute drive from the town of lakehurst, nj ( i do not know the zip code there ). there is a very large us naval base located in lakehurst, nj. most people i know locally believe that this specific us military naval base has nuclear weapons located on its very large base. when the local & state wide nj press has inquired as to whether or not this us naval base does or does not have nuclear weapons on it's grounds or within it's large & multi-faceted infrastructure. the official spokespeople from this us military facility have consistently responded with the answer: \"no comment\". i've read & heard in the recent past, that ufo's are frequently attracted to military facilities that contain nuclear weapon's. possibly that's was why the specific ufo sighting i observed. very may well have been within the specific area that i have just related. beyond my original accurate described observation. which is now being honestly shared & reported here.

approaching route 40, coming from interstate 95. on my way home i noticed helicopter activity around parkville, then again around rosedale. one helicopter, i knew for sure was a local news station.I could tell from the markings. there was a second helo, hovering near rt 40 to my right. i wasnt sure if this was baltimore county police aviation unit or another news chopper. as i was looking to determine the markings on the second helicopter,  i saw a very large black cylindrical object high in the sky moving very fast from west to east, outside of normal flight paths.It did not have a vapor trail as normal jet aircraft would. the object looked very similar to some sightings that i have seen reported in georgia and florida in mid to late september that appeared to look like a boat or ark. i saw it go behind a very thin cloud. i could see the sky through this cloud, and the object for about a second. i did not see the object come out the other side of the cloud.  i lost sight of it at this point. there was a lot of traffic and i had to pay attention to the road in front of me. in this area, there is martin state airport, which is a maryland air national guard base. there are also frequent commercial aircraft in this area landing at baltimore washington international airport about 30 miles south of here.  i knew right away that this was not a commercial aircraft or standard military aircraft. i immediately thought to myself \"i'm pretty sure i just saw a ufo.\" i got the chills and i am getting the chills as i write this report. i am a believer in extraterrestrial beings, and i do watch the skies. living around/near military bases and airports, i know what commercial and standard military aircraft look like and how they manuever. this object was not like
