away from saratoga ny heading towards utica ny. the driver spotted something in the sky asking the other passengers what it was. it was around 1:30 pm and i was sitting in the back seat when i looked at the \"object\" pointed out by the driver. i saw a dark cigar shaped \"object\" that was hovering in the distance. at first i didn't know what the \"object\" was but everyone in the car discussed and dismissed several options of what it could be. we ruled out a plane, helicopter, blimp and even a cloud. the car was traveling at around 50 mph and we followed this \"object\" for at least 10 minutes and never lost sight of it but never seeming to get closer to it. one of the passengers had a cell phone that took photos taking several photos from inside the car. the \"object\" seemed to keep hovering but moving slowly to the right but staying ahead of the car. we arrived in a small town (johnstown ny) and pulled the car into a store parking lot. i got out of the car taking the other passenger's cell phone taking photos from outside, the other males remained inside the car. we tried to get closer to the \"object\" but were now in town with stores and then neighborhoods and lost sight of the object. on our drive home we all discussed what we each saw. one of the passengers estimated the \"object\" at (40-50) yards in length and the driver estimated it to stay about a mile ahead of us. all the males passengers work together and have discussed our sighting since deciding to report it here. i've reviewed the photos and although they are not close-ups the \"object\" we witnessed does appear in the photos. i've zoomed in to the best i could and noticed something i did not see with my naked eye during my sighting. the zoom of the photo shows a \"glow\" on the top and bottom of the \"object\". since the sighting i can not stop thinking about it because i've never had a sighting before which is why i'm writing this now.","distance":"Over One

sky. as an amateur astronomer, i had with me my celestron binoculars and a tripod. we decided to look at the object through them. \r\n\r\nthe object appeared as a disk with lights rotating around it (blues, greens, whites and reds) - it was similar to looking at the dog star through binoculars (the weird prism effect) except this object was not moving like the stars, but  horizontally. it hovered but was slowly moving in a south-westerly direction, about 30 or 40 degrees above the horizon. we observed the object for about an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nthrough the binoculars, it was possible to see the lights quite clearly, but roughly every second, the object appeared to blur, like a heat haze. this was a very regular thing and because of the tripod could not have been caused by heartbeat movement of the binoculars. to me, this was the aspect of the object that made me believe it was not a technology that i have ever seen before. the only thing it could have been was a helicopter with a set of rotating lights above the rotors, with an atmospheric effect causing the blurring. i think this is unlikely.\r\n\r\nall three of us observed the object and the blurring effect. unfortunately i do not know if it was a large object very far away or a small on much closer. from our vantage point on the mountain, it is a reasonable guess to say the object was a minimum of 10 miles from us. sadly, none of us made a video or took any images - i am annoyed at myself for this omission. so that's it - i now look every night i can to see something like this again and am a staunch believer in the ufo phenomenon what i saw makes me believe the technology displayed by this object is far in advance of even the latest physics research/hypotheses of us humans.","distance":"Over One

walls. i stared right at the one above us, gun in hand and the middle was round and shaped like a white bubble. there were 3 bars outside the orb connecting to an outer ring that was like a tube and in it were small balls of light going round and round on the outer tube. after standing there for what seemed like about 15 minutes. then the orb by the motel flew up and so did the one that was above us. they were joined by 2 other orbs that came from nowhere and the 4 of them flew off without sound towards denver. as they flew they gained more speed then all 4 went and kinda fanned out flying up then disappeared. me and my wife went inside and drew what we saw for comparison and it was the same. but, we did notice that it was 8pm when we went back into our apartment. no reaction from the dogs

telling me that it did it again. but it shifted, maybe about an inch over and just as bright. the second time my heart stopped because i knew this was a \"new\" event. we've seen lights before..Never this \"kind\" i kept thinking it was because we had the fire going, so were going to try it again and see if we can get the same response. it happened (blinked) maybe 6 times total but faded after the first 2 really bright bursts. there was a large plane that flew right by it and we didn't see any swift movements by it. it was a dot in the sky and the light came on..So hard to describe it unless you were there. scary..Yes. because it seemed so close or like it was going to get even brighter, maybe a star exploded? and exciting at the same time because it was \"different\". there is a mountain

flashing. we also observed 4 planes flying by over the course of the 30-40 minutes we observed the unidentified craft, the planes were very obviously quite a bit lower than this craft. we watched it for about 35 minutes and over that time it didn't move too far (distance wise), always stayed within our line of site, but was moving around with no observable pattern during the entire time. when we left the area to go home it was still in the sky, blinking/flashing and moving around strangely. no pictures or video were taken due to the fact that our phone cameras aren't that great, how far away

made up of metal panels with different types of indentations on each panel.My cousin and sister report more of a disk shape.(mother and brother are deceased) mother did remember the incident but we never talked about it and i never talked with my brother.In fact i had forgotten about it until my cousin mentioned it to me some 13yrs or so later.The object sat in the lot and i was thinking about the movie the day the earth stood still and said to myself\"well i wonder if anything is going to get out\" just after i thought this the craft rose above the barn and in a second was a black dot in the sky.My cousin became afraid and wanted to go back home.I said wait a minute and went to the barn lot and observed a yellow ring of dead grass.I drove out by there a few yrs ago and now there is a pole barn on that very sight.Just recently i spoke with my cousin and she asked me if i noticed any scoop like marks on my body that had been there forever but didn't know how they got there.I told her that i have a small scoop mark on my left upper outside leg that i thought was maybe a chicken pock scar but wasn't sure.My sister also has a similar mark only on the back of her leg.My cousins

different random points on an linear path between cygnus and cassiopia, appearing essentially in the region from cygnus to cassiopia in almost popcorn fashion. starlike object dwelled stationary for short periods at times with out moving, indicating no constant lateral velocity or propulsion, therefore not a satellite. the starlike object would appear in one position, go out, and then appear (\"pop up\") in another position; second observer, my wife also observed the same phenomenon, we were both surprised; i've seen single flashes before, but nothing this numerous; no sound; starlike objects appeared to be very high altitude; no tail on the starlike objects; it's unlikely they were numerous meteorites coming straight towards me having no tail; i stopped watching when none appeared for a while; the video on my cell phone didn't show anything because of the low light intensity; if anyone else was looking at this region of the sky at the same time, they may have seen the starlike

sometimes it would be white to blue or white to red, other times it was only white light. at first i thought it could be a helicopter, but realized its path was changing. in between flashes of light, it would go from traveling northeast to traveling east. i then knew it was not a helicopter or plane, nor could it have been a satellite. i tried to film it with no results, but am uploading the video i took encase you have better graphics than i and can make it out. after 5 mins i realized i was probably watching a ufo. as a sky watcher, i know when i am seeing something man made. it's path was somewhat erratic. when it flashed at times, the light was very very bright, brighter than a meteor falling to earth. this is not the first time i have witnessed a ufo in this area. possibly drawn here because there is a diamond and crystal mines nearby. i know this was a ufo, alien, i'm not sure, but i am certain it was a ufo. left me feeling privileged, as i have witnessed many ufo's in this area

over us it seem like a 60 seconds. it then vanished like someone turned off the light. we thought it was a meteor and that it crashed so we went to look up the hill but it was to dark and we could not see past a foot. we went back to the house and i turned on the tv to see what the news had to say, but nothing, so i then called the local radio  station to see if they knew anything about a comet crashing which they said no. the crazy thing is that i remember looking at my watch seeing that it was 7pm and the time i called the radio station was around 8:30pm. it could no have taken a hour and a half to walk up the hill and back to the house. my cousin never remember the sighting, he died at 58 from a rare bone cancer that made him go from 5 feet 9 to 5 feet 2 and the looked like he was 90

sit and star gaze.\r\n my neighbor to the south was leaving for his 3rd shift job,he rolled up to me and asked why i was sitting in the dark. i told him i wanted to watch the stars. he replied as he looked out from his side window that it was a good night for doing this since the stars seemed bright. he had just left the shared drive from our condos to the street when i turned to watch the sky in the north. i had just started to scan the sky from north to south when i spotted a semi bright object  moving rapidly southwest. \r\n\r\n object was just a little larger than the stars.Moving very fast.\r\n\r\n as i tracked this object i also saw another bright light approaching from the south. it appeared that they were on a collision course. but when they were about (an half inch apart when holding my arm at it length) they slowed and began to circle each other. one craft was larger than the other. they had maybe made about 10-12 circles when they both stopped and started to move in a southern direction.\r\n a commercial jet flew below them (just as i observed all this) in a western direction.Both craft appeared to be saucer shaped of unknown size.To far away to be accurate on shape.\r\n\r\n also from one or both of craft there was several bright flashes, seemed directed towards earth.\r\nthen they both flew in a southern direction side by side.\r\n\r\n i had forgot to pick up either one of my phones when i went outside. i wanted to call my ufo friend, when out of the east i saw 2 red lights flashing.\r\n  i could not tell what they were till they had passed about maybe a mile from south of town and from the east.\r\n\r\n they appeared to be fighter aircraft at about 4-5000 ft elevation and moving very fast.\r\n\r\n i confirmed this from hearing their jet roar when they were out of sight. they were maybe just over 1 mile away when i first saw them. they were not in afterburner as i could not see any jet flame from their engines. only lights were the rotating red on bottom  of craft. they seemed to be on an intercept course with these 2 ufo's.\r\n\r\n my heart was racing so fast from seeing all this.\r\n i went inside my home and got my phones, came back out to sit on my tailgate and call my ufo investigator friend.\r\ni called my friend ,it went to voice mail, i left a message about what i had just saw. i decided to try again to get thru. he had just answered and told me he was just about to play message i had left. time elapsed about 6 minutes. i was trying to scan the sky while having a conversation with my friend.\r\n\r\n  i began to briefly  repeat what message i had left when  bright lights came from the southwest traveling to northeast. it was much lower than before and it was or appeared to be a large triangle shaped craft. (my first time ever seeing this type) it appeared to be about 2 miles high now.If lower then this craft was gigantic in size like several football fields large. \r\n\r\n craft was dimly lit but i could see it's large shape against backdrop of stars, i also noticed what i thought to be 2 red orbs following craft or part of craft.\r\n it turned out to be fighter aircraft chasing it. i estimated they all were traveling at 900-1000mph or faster since they covered what part of sky i had view of in 20-30 seconds and were out of sight.\r\n\r\n jets appeared to be within 1000 feet of craft and was keeping up with it,\r\n \r\n all i could hear was roar of jet engines and whine of turbofans\r\n\r\ndo not know if this tri-craft was same as craft as 1st sighting.  it was closer to ground than first two craft and was only maybe 2-3 minutes from when they were out of my sight and me coming in to get phones and this craft returning back over me to the westside of town.\r\n \r\n  no other sounds could be heard from ufo. \r\n\r\n i had to apologize to my friend because i was somewhat speechless, unable to describe what i was seeing and had just experienced.\r\n\r\n this craft was not as bright as before, but i could make out its shape against the stars. the craft did not emit any sound that i could hear. \r\n\r\nif craft had any lights they were on bottom and dim. it appeared to have bright light at front of craft, this is how i first saw it, but when it passed,only outline of craft against the sky.\r\n only sound was from military aircraft and only after they had past my home and were almost out of sight before sound was.\r\n\r\n i discussed what i had saw with my friend on phone and then came inside to write down all info while it was fresh in my mind. then filled out my sighting repot on mufon.\r\n\r\n*********** this was a first for me seeing this type of craft and seeing  military jets involved.\r\n               in past had seen military helicopters where ufo crafts had been. ************\r\n\r\nalso, why was i prompted to go outside??? this has happened several times in my past. \r\n\r\nglad i was obidieant to my thought of going outside, \r\n\r\nmy only regret was

was and inspected the night sky. i noticed a uniquely bright object just over the tree line appearing green/red light so bright it twinkled and had streaks that were unpleasant to look at. the object hovered in the same position for 10+ minutes. i continued to observe from inside my home to see if something odd would happen. the lights suddenly dimmed to the point the object appeared as white and pinpoint like a star. it was hard to see but i watched it as long as possible, as i watched it slowly tracked to the south until i lost visual in the trees.\r\n\r\nwe are in a flight path for aircraft but this did not look or act in that manner. further, the brightness of the light was unusual. there was no noise to speak of. i though it was a bright celestial object, but knowingly was impossible because the color and intensity was by far greater than jupiter. i thought perhaps a plane but was hovering for to long and the dimmed light that did not blink and slowly tracked away from the flight path and went slower than aircraft but faster than celestial objects to the earth's movements. hoping someone else saw and reported so this may provide support for that sighting. was strange and not sure what could be.
