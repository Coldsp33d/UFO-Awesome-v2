only saw it for a few seconds before trees obscured its descent. kept watching through the window for a minute, looked away then back again. saw the red bar above the obscuring trees moving slowly south. the bar now had blue lights around it and descended again out of sight after a few seconds. based on the distance and size it appeared to be from here, it was too big to be a drone. no visible faa lights either. very important to note that the sighting was right under a flight path for planes and helicopters, although from the distance i estimate the object was, it was far too low to have been a plane or a helicopter in the flight path. i saw no other objects in the flight path or parallel to it until after the sighting. i did not hear anything from the direction of the object. waited

reflective object not moving and was over land and over clouds. a more precious location can be determined by the coast formation on the photos. i immediately started photographing it. it seemed an undetermined distance away, but a good distance away. i observed and photographed the object when i could see it through my camera. i took 7 photos throughout the 4 minute period i made the observation. it was difficult to get focus on the object given the distance, so that's why only 7 photos were taken. i also photographed a moving airplane with contrail in the same frame as the the non moving object that is moving right to left. i photograph it starting on the right and over a few photos, ends up on the left of the object, showing it hadn't moved. after 4 minutes and the moving of the plane, i lost sight of both of the object and airplane. i was moving right to left with the object as well. all photos come with details of the camera used, settings used and times. my camera was not set to the right time, but it does show the first and last photos being about 4 minutes apart. the photos also need to be zoomed in to see the object and other airplane, except for the first

objects it the air that looked like nothing we have ever seen.  triangular objects that would stop and start randomly.  objects that were more circular that would move vertically as well as horizontally.  it seemed as it they were preforming for us.  it was explained , by my mother, that they were \"experimental\" air craft from the air force base in columbus ms.  we looked forward to our entertainment.  one fall evening, my parents were in the house and i was outside alone.  i wandered several hundred yards behind our house and felt, heard, and saw simultaneously a large, cigar/blimp shaped object.  a fat cigar or skinny blimp.  it was a dull pewter color. then it emitted  a white light down.  the craft was not on the ground, but hovered just below tree level.  i was drawn to the light, had a feeling of total comfort, almost euphoria.  i have no idea how i got there, but i came to in a room with no windows, there were no lights, but it was very bright.  there were 3 male and 1 female human-like \"people\" there.  the men looked like super athletes.  close to 7 feet tall.  blond hair, blue eyes which were a little larger than normal.  the clothing was plain, but skintight, almost appeared to be painted on.  the woman was a few inches shorter, very curvy.  i was only 7-8 years old, but i immediately had a feeling of comfort, trust...And even attraction to her.  as i was looking around, i had no discomfort, all i could move was my eyes and head.  they touched me, had something like a wand and went all around me with it, the entire time we communicated but didn't talk.    it was primarily them telling me the evils of nuclear power/weapons and to always do all i could to stay away from and stop its use.  they also told me that they would be watching after me and \"mine\", not to worry, i would always be taken care of. over the next few years, i had communication with them, but it was less vivid memory.  i would be asleep, have almost a feeling of a dream i was aboard, then wake up in a chair outside.  i always felt great after these visits.  i found my self looking forward to these.   i told my mother after the first and every other encounter i had.   she told me that she believed me and that it could be real or could be a dream.  but convinced me not to tell anyone else, because they would not understand and it would make life hard on me.  some time later i noticed a 2-3 cm hard object just under the skin on my left outer mid-thigh.  i have asked several doctors, but have had no explanation on what it is.  i have had spontaneous pneumothorax (collapsed lung for no apparent reason) 5 times as a teenager.  no problems since.  i put this repressed, or did not think that this could be real, as these were not bad experiences and were not like aliens that i have read about.  i did a search on the internet to find a movie, and a picture of the type of \"people\" that took me came up.  that is when i have had a flood of these memories return.   \r\ni have a great life, i am a successful eye doctor, with a wonderful, healthy family.  i just had to report this and want to know if there are any other similar reports.

thought was  string of balloons rotating in the sky. but for being so high and far away they would have had to be really large. my balcony veiw can see where the planes come in and circle before landing. i saw a plane a minutes before but none during the entire time the objects crossed the sky. \r\n    the rotating string of objects although rotating were also moving across the sky fast, and smoothly changed from rotating to slithering up and down in tight formation still looking connected. the motions looked like a dragon. and i'm now saying to myself what am i looking at.It didn't seem like something balloons would do,but i still felt it was some sort of objects on a string, until it changed directions and formation again. as this is happening the objects were moving in almost a circle path around my point of veiw. so when they made this formation change into a v formation they were turning towards my direction now getting closer. i now felt ok its a huge fleet of birds, but i could see no wings moving. getting closer i could now see the motions of the objects changing directions like fish, but still saw no wings or flapping. and the speed was to fast for birds. once to the east of my sight the objects changed formation again to the string pattern and changed direction moving away,where i could see they were not connected, where no birds, or balloons. each time the formation changed  different object took the lead  which doesnt seem possible something connected. i've lived within eyesite of major airports my entire life but was left feeling scared from what i saw. i never saw birds that big, fly in such tight and strange patterns, and especially that fast. and i've never seen that many fighters at once,that low, or with no sound.","distance":"Over One

reflective.. it's top and bottom were angled slightly in while the middle of it was more verticle and had panel sections that were darker and may have been windows.. the verticle section was over 10' tall.. my guess on the overall height would be around 20-25' and the width was around 100-160', the wall panel area did not rotate, but the lower and upper areas could have.  height above the ground 500' or less.. looked like it passed over the tall trees at the end of the road by about 1 or 2 times their height. my sister and friend both said it came from the north and went right down the middle of the road.. it did not appear to change elevation or direction... where i was playing tight to the backside of a house... we did not notice any noise, smell or shadow that alerted us.. just my sisters scream... my sister said that she saw a person in the vehicle's window... her friend didn't say that she did... we told my mom...Who thought my sister was up to her old tricks.. tried to let the subject go.. but, she finally called my dad... who came home earlier but not immediately.. we described it to him all four of us and then he called somebody to report it... i believe he called the farmington police and/or oakland county sheriffs department... there were other reports like it and then he called my mom's cousin, who was a high up in the air force at wright-patterson... the next day two men in a unmarked dark sedan showed up, and we told them what we saw.. they asked some questions, talked a little with dad and then left, then in the next day or two after dinner, mom's cousin came to the house, dressed in uniform with another man that was not (and said almost nothing), we (sister and i)were asked about it and after my mom made tea, she took me and my two sisters for a walk.. in the dark... i think that is the first time we ever did that that late at night...And that was it nothing more.. ( this was when i was 6 or 7 my sister was 11 or 12).. until about 15 years ago a good friend of mine said the old neighbor would be in town and wanted to see me.. we met for dinner and she brought the ufo up... in nearly the same way.. and it still bothers her and her sister... my sister still remembers it too.\r\n\r\na couple of weeks went by and as i was visiting my parents i mentioned that i saw her and then brought up the ufo...He said quite bluntly that it was a ufo that was confirmed by mom's cousin in the air force.. my mom startled me when she said her cousin was on a team that retrieves downed ufo's...\r\n\r\nas a side note... a couple of years later my mom had a stroke and i was talking to my dad and he brought up the ufo sighting, said he was sorry for not taking about it earlier, but he was asked not to.. and then said that the last time he visited with mom's cousin.. he asked him about his work.. and he said that.. there are space crafts and aliens... upon my dad's death, unknown co-workers (1940-1962) told me about his past employment.. dad told us he was a chief draftsmen for a defense contractor ( the only lie i have ever heard him say)... they said he was the companies top manager of engineering.. designed the guidance gyro's for the navies bo-mark (nuclear defense miss el), dart drone gyro copter, target practice jet drones for the korean war...They all figured he was a dead man when he quit in 1962... either by cia/fbi or by russians...Too much important design knowledge... they said  multiple times the feds came in and gave them a scare/threatened if they were to leave.. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Patterned

\"drone greys\", telepathic communication with greys and a single hybrid, abduction; so it would obviously seem in comparison to dreams, and over 30 ufo sightings also viewed by friends of mine in the san luis obispo county, california, very close to diablo canyon, outdated nuclear power station, with credible u.F.O sighting. to elude i'm not a nut, with a substandard i.Q and sociopathic agendas, i watch my t.E.D. talks, am a student at cuesta college with a broad emphasis on education; sponsored by diablo canyon taxes, am aware of the elite institution, don't like \"vaccines, fluoride, pesticides, fertilizer, herbicides\", have decent grammar and diction, i'm socialist, i know the buddha and krishna and dao, etc. i have had dream premonitions of places unvisited and events yet to happen, telepathic conversation during an abduction, tours of a ship and its electro magnetic technology etc, colors smells technology, i asked all the right questions and asked for the event, childhood fixation, drawing, events of the beta folks, operations involving drugs, attempted sexual bribery, laser augmentation, morphine, etc, a hybrid doctor who unveiled her \"true self\", and have witnessed countless ufo sighting at work during 3-4 am, via a psychic request. i know what hertz can do for us, i know of magnets, and electrons etc, i know of tesla. i have had an mmpi, am diagnosed autistic with a slurry of other western labels, and am not a hillbilly or bro. my family all knows, and believes, they've been through this for generations now. my family has been inhabiting the same geographical area for over 100 years dating to 4 generations, with my own abduction taking place near my grandparents. the greys or beta etc have science we have hear, so i feel. the elite agenda to hide truth is large, scary, and the dollar reigns. i want help, hoping not this isn't a \"non-profit\" scheme with history channel b.S. with some sick sociopathic agenda. i know the earth future, with or without humans, it will be fine for billions of years. i just want more credibility from outside sources to validate odd odd things either other sentient visitors or fellows human have experimented on me and many other to be true. my apologies for grammatical errors and lack of shift caps on sentences. thanks. billy gene..Etic, btw, i clean up my creek and care about the steelhead, save the steelhead! feed the 3/4 starving humans! excuse this long shot of ego validity, i don't consent to unessecary government interference and violation of my constitutional rights. in all forms. i have a lot to share, and a lot of journalism, and that whole, freedom of information jazz, my county needs some media help, national geographic just made a cool piece on car jackings in santa maria, f that place, huge amounts of industrial ag poison. help out us folk in slo county dealing with rich sociopaths and way to many jets, ufos, nuclear soon to be disaster plants. come on mufon, you have corporate help. expose the truth, this is all real, and dating back to ww2 and beyond, things have been \"influencing\" this world. especially in the last 60 years, or me, and many others including government bodies, are just insane and twisted, etc...I am not quite sure on how to approach this. but, frequency is matter, matter is data, and manipulation of thus is sentience. all this occurred in san luis obispo, ca, 93422. my feelings..Many, i had marks, three dots in a triangle, white scars, on my left arm and leg, both of which were amputated and reinstated during my abduction. objects move randomly, non linear, faster than a satellite, stop trajectory, grow, shrink, leave red dots, look like magnesium glowing, always  at 3-5 am. the organs belt seems to be a spot of interest, and the milky way tendril we can see, they use push-pull physics validated by hawking. its visible as they expand and contract. they telepathically bacon you to see them, as they have over 30 times. really mufon, sit outside at night from 3-5am in slo county ca and you'll will assured see a spacecraft in the summer every night, every third night in other seasons. its constant. you think texas sees a lot, not like ca. we have a deep ocean. i have a lot of information as a person and as a human to share. be safe, in this very crooked world of money and sociopathic elites. i haven't looked into history channels funding, which isn't good on my part, i hope you don't get federal dollars as a means of brainwash for the masses, you are on cable t.V. muffin, but so is pbs and npr. amy goodwin is

were doing when the sighting occured.It was about 9:10 p.M. we both got in my car and headed down the road.My daughter is very into the ufo phenomena and always learns as much information about them as possible.The entire time we drove down the rode to the waters edge,she kept her eyes to the sky looking for anything 'unusual'.Once we reached out spot,we both got out of the car and began to set up our small bit of fishing gear.Theres a large rock that my daughter and i always sit on,it was the best place to fish.Because i had nothing else to do i kept my eyes on the sky and noticed a small orange orb lingering like a star.I kept my eye on it as my daughter continue fishing.It began to move and i quickly alerted my daughter. she lookd up happily she'd seen ufos before so she was excited to add another sighting.As the object began to move it made a large circle around us, after about 30 minutes watching it i noticed several other small lights with it. after a full circle was made i grew tense so i told my daughter to pack up all the fishing gear and jump in the car.We did. at first the car had trouble starting but after a few twists of the key the car started.I began driving down the long narrow road that led to our fishing spot. my daughter kept her eyes to the sky and informed me that it was following us. after a long pause of silence 3 patterned beeps were emitted from the car, my daughter and i didn't recognize them. i wanted to continue driving but i had to hold because of a stoplight.I wasn't paying attention to the skies but my daughter was she asked me how the object new where we lived. northwest of our location was our home. the object continue down the road and turned directly over our house. the light turned green and i drove to our house. as soon as we reached the lawn i stop the car, jumped out, and ran to the door.My daughter stood outside trying to catch a glimpse of the object but the area we lived in at the time was wooded so you'd imagine it
