each like a single, thin horizontal bar, very slightly angled up toward the ends, with equally spaced lights (about 10) running entire length of bar, blinking randomly in various light colors; no structure visible (no underside, sides, or anything behind or above the bar of lights); lights were not bright like jet lights appear head-on, but more like “running lights”; no physical movements of craft itself; stationary in the sky, despite winds; craft always facing in one direction (westward); no side views of craft; always same shape no matter my angle to them; the two maintained exact distance from each other, a mile or more apart. i was surprised and curious but not fearful; thought “they're sightseeing”; sensed they could see my car lights on the dark road; wanted to pull over and observe but didn't think it safe to stop on remote, dark road, as i was alone, the wind was blowing, with only an occasional car passing in the opposite direction.\r\nsize of ufos: larger than jumbo jet (which has 222-foot wingspan). \r\naltitude of ufos: closer craft, 3,500 feet?

telepathic communications of some type with others that sound human. interactive miterials with those \"others\". closing my eyes and seeing as clearly if my eyes were open but whats i was seeing was some where else with other \"ppl\" with intention of accomplishing a goal unkonw to me and grey aliens looking in windows knocking on them to get my attention and them using the telepathy or something telling me to chill out and alot of other things.And alot more experienced with them. for several yrs ive wondered about the pops/booms,voices, rumbles and light flashes and how they do what they do.\r\n\r\nabduction /visitation again\r\n\r\ntonight jan 3 2018 i walked out in the back yard and. was abducted/visited i looked up a large orb or ship like object was hovering over my home a less than 100 ft it interacted with me using a human voice. showed me other people/enties and i felt like they wanted me to socialize i refused (this happened alot but the first time i've seen thier craft or what have you this close) and was returned to my door step looking in the same direction with the object still at the same altitude .It flashed a bright light i heard a boom or pop. then i looking up in the same direction it was at an altitude of 500 ft plus.For several years they've been harrassing me and worse.\r\n\r\ni'm sure that the orbs that piolots see ect have a purpose of spying on humans . and with what theyve been doing i have developed the assumption that they have been finding humans with certain characteristics taking that what they like to developed a personality for aliens who look human and can provide a vibe that a human would respect. i've see greys up close and the use our brains against us. making us feel what they want us to. and that purpose it to know where our minds are i.E. scared defensive inspired ect. to use the unused part of our minds. \r\n\r\nive been abducted multiply times. tonight i'm sure that whats been happing is alien.

amherst, massachusetts, in western mass about 1/2 hour north of springfield.  i lived in the orchard hill dorms. on a september or october night a group of friends and myself walked thru the orchard, crossed  east pleasant street and continued to the railroad tracks where there was a one story tower with an elevated platform, maybe 15 feet off the ground.  we were hanging out up there when we noticed some lights in the sky moving around.  about 10 or 12 of them  as we watched  they made a formation and then stopped in mid-air.  no sounds.  they were very small and hard to judge how far away they were.   as this amazing thing was happening someone shouted  'this can't be happening!\" and the lights disappeared disappeared\r\n      we looked around, and were all concentrating on what had just happened.  soon, maybe a minute later, the lights came back on, and were in motion and formed a vertical formation in mid air and then stopped-a vertical formation but with a few in the formation near the top- i forget exactly but they were not all in one line, just most of them.  we stared.  again someone shouted...\" this can't be happening!!\" and the lights went out.\r\n     again we looked and searched the sky for them and lo and behold they re-appeared but now they were closer, so much closer that i could now perceive a moderate spinning, what was before seen as one light per object now was seen as a somewhat spinning sphere/disc with slightly flashing lights, but they were still far away, if i had to guess i'd say 1 or 2 miles    \r\n       this time, as they were getting closer, i had to really think about  what i would do if they landed   because these ufos- i call them objects now because i could see some manifestation of that, the spinning, the flashing, that was not happening at the onset. they had been tiny lights in the distance at first sight,  but now they were indeed getting closer and i decided for sure i would not go towards them but would definitely run in the opposite direction!  once again our concentration was interrupted by a shout  or an expletive and they were gone, in the blink of an eye.  it was obvious to me that we had something to do with the lights appearing and disappearing.  when we focused they turned on, when we were in disbelief they turned off\r\n     we left the coal tower  and walked down east pleasant street to town to grab a grinder.  about 3 minutes into the walk a huge cigar shaped craft whooshed by  us over the tree tops.  this was really close. it was also silent but for the air friction.  \r\n  why didn't we report this?   i don't know, we were 19 and 20 then,  but i'm glad i looked for and found this site to put it in the record\r\n     \r\n   ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

(no longer visible for about 2mn, then re apeared, star like again, and stood there all night (north/west above my head).","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":89313,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.8383595551066,"location":null,"logNumber":"FR-01032018-0021","longitude":1.2308131982665085,"occurred":1497922020000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nouvelle-Aquitaine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1515000794000,"summary":"Suddenly apeared, hovered, i blinked my cam light, they stoped and turned their on (stationary 4 a minute). then lifted/drifted away slowly","tags":["video","ufo","lights","flash","hovering"],"timeZone":"Europe/Paris","timeZoneName":"Europe/Paris","tweeted":1515119144517,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/89313_submitter_file1__boomrangshape35mnbefore0.52amfirstsight0360.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/89313_submitter_file2__IMAG0365.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/89313_submitter_file3__IMAG0366.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/89313_submitter_file4__IMAG0367.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/89313_submitter_file5__IMAG0368.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/89313_submitter_file6__boomrangshape50369notvisibleanymore.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/89313_submitter_file7__boomrangshape60372visibleagain0372.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/89313_submitter_file8__365edited2.png"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"87000","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":197,"locationName":"Limoges, Nouvelle-Aquitaine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:3769"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Puerto Penasco,Sonora,Mex","country":"MX","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Outside on my sun porch,having a cigarette. casually looked to my nw,and saw larger object rapidly fall,stop and hover above cell phone tower and smaller white objects streaking in different directions,some becoming stationary,while others disappearing,but all eventually disappeared. it was dark,with cloud cover,so i didn't know what it was. as it got light,larger object went straight up,and disappeared. smaller orb like objects just disappeared stationary,before larger object. my reaction was,who am i going to mention this to,other than my wife.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":89312,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"MX-01032018-0020","longitude":null,"occurred":1514962500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1514995253000,"summary":"Larger craft straight up and down path,hovered above cell phone tower,with bright white orbs (hundreds).","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"PST8PDT","timeZoneName":"PST8PDT","tweeted":1515118846662,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"83553","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Puerto Penasco,Sonora,Mex","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:3770"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Langenau","country":"Germany","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Ich stand auf der terrasse und schaute in den himmel richtung süd-ost, plötzlich sah ich ein objekt das aussah wie eine sternschnuppe doch sie fiel nicht zu boden sondern stieg extrem schnell und geradlinig durch die wolkendecke nach oben. das objekt konnte ich nach der wolke nicht mehr sehen. mein gefühl war normal, nicht außergewöhnlich weil ich zu anfang dachte es ist eine sternschnuppe doch es bewegte sich gegen die gravitation und das mit extremer geschwindigkeit, somit konnte es keine sternschnuppe sein. dies war auch nicht meine erste sichtung von einem ufo. leider habe ich von meiner ersten sichtung noch nie jemand davon erzählt.

fireworks going off in my neighborhood and across the city out my dining room window.  i noticed a bright amber light not moving or stationary which i thought was very strange as i could see and hear fireworks going off.  i decided to go outside in my backyard to get a better look.  \r\n\r\nonce i got outside i see that there are actually 2 amber lights one a little higher than the other.  after a few minutes watching the light highest up of the 2 slowly ascended straight up into what was a light layer of cloud cover.  then after another minute or 2 the second light ascended straight up into the cloud layer as well.  i could see the clouds reflecting the color of the lights as they ascended.  i could no longer see the lights after they ascended.\r\n\r\ni live on a hilltop on the north end of town with a great view of the city to the south.  the lights from my vantage point were to the south eastwardly direction.  i was looking up at about a 45 degree angle.  i took a video of the lights on my cell phone, which doesn't do what i saw justice, but the video basically shows the lights and them ascending up into the clouds as i described.  i regrettably used profanity while recording the video so i am not sure if i should submit.  i took a 30 second video and then stopped so that i could turn off the flash on my phone and then continued for another 2 minutes until the lights went out of my view.\r\n\r\nthere is a air guard base here on the south end of town and i am very familiar with the f-15 fighter jets and what they look like at night.  i have watched them from my dining room window many times.  as far as i know they were not doing night flight exercises new year's eve.  i am also familiar with what drones look like at night.  these lights were much larger than a drone and too high up to be a drone.  i couldn't make out any shapes other that the lights themselves, which were square/diamond shaped.\r\n\r\ni was really hoping that other people saw the lights just to give me some validation or an explanation for what i saw.","distance":"Over One
