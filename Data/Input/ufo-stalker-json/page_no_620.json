it was a calm cool night and stepped out on the deck of the combine and wanted to look at stars till he got there.  the combine was facing north so i was able to see the north star and such.  all of the sudden i see a ball of bright white light moving from the ne to sw.  as it got closer i had noticed that it was moving erratically.  this is hard to explain.  if you draw a straight line on a piece of paper,  then draw 2 more lines an inch ubove and below that line.  now this ball of light followed the middle line. yet as it moved i noticed it would go up really fast to the top line then go to the middle line.  if you blinked you would miss it,  it happened fast.  also would do it to the bottom line.  it would also move really fast then go really slow if it was on the middle line, almost to the point it would stop but would not stop.  now this got me thinking if i could hear any engine noise.  at the closest point to me it was pry 5 miles and would be maybe a mile high.  i heard no noise from it at all.  the cool night with no wind would have carried that noise and there was nothing.  i listened really hard for something but nothing.  would blink my eyes and shake my head to see if i was actually seeing that.  this was as bright of white light as i have seen.\r\n\r\nday 2, 3 days later\r\n\r\ni had gotten done with cutting corn for the night and went out behind our farm which was 1 mile north of where i was on the combine 3 nights before.  i go out hunting for anything in the back of the farm place with a spot light and my 22 caliber.  about the same time of night i happen to look to the ne and i see the exact same thing, same direction, same flight path.  only this time i was 1 mile closer.  cool, calm night, just like 3 days prior.  i could not hear a thing coming from it.  i am looking at it in awe as it went from ne to sw.  right after it got straight north of me i thought about shooting the spot light light on it.  so to the nw of me a little bit i did.  that middle line on that paper,  it stayed on that line after that going at a constant speed.  i shined it on the object a second time and a flashing light come on.  i think to make it look like a plane.  still no sound.  but to make that object go from erratic movement to constant speed and a flashing light just by shining a spot light on it baffles me to this day.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

and saw a fleet of blue orb-like ufos in behind the barracks over the woods near some hillsbdoing zig zags. more than 10+, couldnt count them exactly since there were so many and they moved too fast. these craft had to be doing thousands of mph doing zig-zags, 90° and other sharp angular maeuvers. they moved in a straight line, point to point manner and did not stop or slow down to make these angular maneuvers. almost immediately before our drill sergeants came out to dismiss us, they basically abruptly slowed down and \"drifted\" behind a hill when the drill sergeants emerged from the barracks out of sight. once inside the barracks for the night, i personally had extra duty and was cleaning all through the barracks. of course i went straight to the windows to see if the objects were still there/returned. they did. i watched them for around almost an hour out the back windows of the barracks in the same direction as before outside. still performing impossible maneuvers continuously. they never went away, instead after about an hour or so, i became to frightened to continue watching. i sought out the d sergeant on cq duty for the night and managed to hang out in the d.S. office until extra duty, once i was allowed to go to my rack to go to sleep, me and another soldier checked out a window in that same direction, as i was still too frightened to be alone. they were finally gone. had another experience witb my company during our final field training exercise. completely differemt craft this time. very large orange orb at night. looked like a second full moon (it was either a full moon or very close to it) in the sky. only hovered a couple hundred yards away from out bivouac, a couple hundred feet off of the ground. several times that night it would appear silently out of nowhere, hover for long perilds of time and then slowly drift behing a hill and be gone only to reapear in the sky half hour to an hour later. there were flares in the sky all night simultaniously with it and can say with extreme confidence it was absolutely not on those flares. very very strange way to experience my bct and introduction to the

was working on my computer at home at 5:00 pm today, oct. 3, 2015. the computer faces the ottawa river overlooking quebec, the usual area where i have seen ufos in the past 4 years when all of a sudden i noticed a strange area in the sky.  it was still very much daylight of course but in the clouds there was this vertical column of rainbow.  it's the only way i can explain it.  it consisted of rows of the regular rainbow colors but it wasn't bent in an arc like a regular rainbow and it was only about what to me looked like a few feet high from here - which of course is far from the actual height of this phenomenon.  when i looked through my binoculars it was actually two vertical masses of 'rainbow' one parallel to the other - like rainbow blobs - so to speak.\r\n\r\nit was the strangest thing i have ever seen and the other weird thing was that it lasted almost an hour in that same spot.  it got a little dimmer, maybe clouds passed in front of it or it dimmed on it's own, but it wasn't long til it was back to full rainbow color strength.\r\n\r\ninstinctively i had this feeling that this was just not right and that something else could well happen so i kept an eye on it when i was working on the computer. about a half hour into it, now about 5:30pm ish i picked up my binoculars and looked at the rainbow-like blobs and i was stunned to see these two huge contrails that went from a cloud above the rainbow blobs straight into the middle of the two rainbow things and at that moment they appeared - two long black narrow what looked like ufos.  they were parallel to each other, very close - belly to belly kind of and they were pointed on an angle almost straight down to the river but slightly angled upwards as if they would fly together down a bit then leveled off.\r\n\r\ni didn't see them disappear or go anywhere else as i put the binoculars down to catch my breath and when i picked them up again they were totally gone leaving the rainbows behind.\r\n\r\nthese two black thin ufos were huge, the way some describe the size of them to be like 2 football fields long.  they were very thin as if they were totally seen from their edges and they were slightly raised in the middle as if domed but slightly.\r\n\r\nwhen i have seen other forms of ufos i haven't been afraid but i have to say this sighting freaked me out.\r\n\r\nthis sighting has really shaken me up and has put the last sighting of a triangle of orbs far behind in comparison.  these two ufos today were just gigantic.  it almost looked as if they had entered through this rainbow portal or something.  they didn't fly in from anywhere else in the sky at all they just came from the huge cloud above the rainbow blobs through the centre of the two short rainbows kind of halted there for a bit belly to belly then they were gone.\r\n\r\nwould be interesting to know if anyone has ever seen this rainbow blob thingy before too?  i sure haven't.\r\n\r\nlater on in the evening around 6pm i noticed another two short vertical rainbows like the one i described above but didn't notice anything in it although i had to attend to other things so didn't really look as closely as i did with the first pair of vertical rainbows.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:20:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

thought it was a vivid dream but now i am wondering if this really happened to me and it was blocked from my memory when it happened.\r\n\r\n my father and i were deer hunting with bow & arrow on the border of illinois and wisconsin near jo daviess county, illinois.  my age was approximately 14 - 15 at the time of this event.  i had a deer come under my tree stand and took a shot.  i waited for my father to return to my tree stand as he was about a mile away in his own tree stand.  this was well after dark.  i told him that i took a shot and we proceeded to follow the blood trail together.  as we were walking through the field following the trail.  i observed a violet light hovering over the tree line going from left to right.  i told my father and he didn't pay much attention because he was following the blood trail and told me to quit messing around.  i shined my flashlight at the light and it darted off toward the woods very fast.  after some time the trail stopped and my father said we would resume search in the morning but he though i probably had a brisket shot to low and wasn't going to get the deer.  that night we ate dinner cooked by the coleman stove and got ready for bed in the back of his old 1973 chevy pickup.  it had a metal cab on the back and i remember windows on the side and in the back.  my dad snored loud and i remember him snoring that night.  as i was laying in the back of the truck at some point of the night or early morning.  i remember having a frightening feeling that someone was watching me to the point i didn't want to open my eyes.  i did and through the side window saw what i think was the big eyed big head grey looking back at me.  i closed my eyes again and heard what was like a mechanical voice telling me \"we are not going to hurt you\" then something made me open the back window of the truck cab and get out.  when i did i observed three short and two taller big head big eyed aliens and a disc shaped craft landed in the field about 200 feet from the truck.  i remember the little ones touching my fingers and leading me toward the craft and saying \"do not be scared\" in a mechanical voice that seemed to be in my head.  that is all i remember.  i woke up in the back of the truck and thinking boy was that a vivid scary dream and it has bothered me since it happened.  to this day when i see a image on tv or other of a big

was early in the hockey season. teams had just been selected and pre-season exhibition games were being played in minor hockey around the province. our london ontario team had travelled to nearby stratford ontario (about 45 minutes drive away) for one of these exhibition games. it was so many years ago, but i believe i was around 10 years old at the time, which places the year at 1979. i believe i was in the major atom age grouping in hockey which aligns with the date estimate. \r\nour optimist club sent all the major age group teams to stratford that day, so the major atoms would play followed by the major peewees, followed by the major bantams and so on. my brother being 2 years older played on the major peewees which meant that after my game, i had to wait around for my brother's game to finish. it had to be either a friday or saturday because i had been given permission to have a sleepover with a friend from my hockey team. my friend and i killed time in the arena while my brother played his game.  as my brother's game came to to the final buzzer, i asked my dad if i could have the car keys to go out to the car with my buddy so we could listen to the radio while waiting for my brother to get changed after his game. my dad, probably eager to get us out of his hair, tells me not to start the car, then hands me the keys. it was a fairly mild october night because my friend mike and i rolled down the front windows of the car, and sat on the car door \"window sills\" so that we're able to look at each across the roof, while the radio is playing. there we are in the parking lot of the stratford arena, sitting in the windows, listening to the radio, when it happened... \r\nfrom behind a tree next to the parking lot, a large angular \"square\" of light suddenly appeared. it looked to be just behind the tree or about 50 feet away, and i'm estimating was about 20 or 30 feet in length on all sides. this was not a light like you see coming from a typical light source, but rather it was like looking into the sun but without any eye irritation, pain, or squinting. the \"square\" was completely pure and uniform white with no part dimmer than any other-- as i try to describe it today i would say that it looked almost like an sliced opening in the fabric of space. there were no discernable edges around the white light, it was just a huge sheet of pure whiteness. time seemed to stand still at the time, as i have difficulty remembering the sequence of events after we first saw the light. i remember the light just disappearing and mike and i running inside the arena in fear to find my parents. of course we tried to share our experience with my parents, but we were not taken too seriously -- which really looking back isn't all that surprising.  what might they have done? they acknowledged that we saw something, but they didn't see it themselves, and we looked to be unharmed.  so what was there to report? and to who?\r\n\r\nthe next part though, is even more strange to me. as we weree driving home back to london, maybe just a few minutes after leaving stratford, out of the star-filled sky (at about the 10 o'clock position), another \"square\" of white light flashes right above the car we're driving in about 100 feet away, and instantaneously retreats back into the sky (to the same area it came from), all within a what seemed like a microsecond. it was almost so fast that you could not detect it's motion path. this time the adults with me saw it. i told them that is what we saw in the car in the parking lot. they said they had no idea what that could have been, then there was a long silence afterward, and we didn't really talk to much about afterward.","distance":"21-100

good friend. we had just returned from the grocery store. it was relatively clear out and the first light caught my eye as it was moving in an abnormal fashion and the light was fairly bright. when i first noticed the object, i figured it was the local police helicopter making its rounds but then i took a closer look and realized that the lights were moving to quickly and making maneuvers that a helicopter couldn't possible manage. after noticing the first lights my fiance pointed just to the right and a little bit higher then first, a second set of lights appeared out the the sparse clouds which looked identical.\r\n\r\nboth sets of lights had 4 red lights that were in a diamond shape and seemed to change shape into a rectangle and then back into a diamond. the lights on both light anomalies would be blinking and pulsating red, once in awhile a white light would pulsate in the middle of the 4 red lights then disappear. the white lights would only appear approximately every 30 seconds then disappear. the 4 red lights looked as if they were rotating in clockwise motion as they flew around in the sky and when the stopped the rotations would stop. the first light anomaly was just a bit lower in the sky then the second, maybe by about the length of 3 full size semi trailers long. and the second set of lights were about 100 meters away to the right. the first set of lights were moving slowly from left to right. once the second set of lights appeared, it quickly moved towards the first set and stopped abruptly just above it. the two sets of lights just hovered briefly then both took a short flight in opposite directions quickly before making a sudden stop then returning in each others direction but crossing ones path. they continued this pattern for about 7 mins before the second set of lights quickly took off the the south east and disappeared. once the second set of light was gone the original set of lights made it's way south before i lost sight of it for approximately 2 mins in the clouds that had started to form. i seen the lights again not to far from the original location, just a little more south. i observed the lights for a few more minutes, the lights were moving from west to east rather fast in a straight flight path. during the last few minutes, all lights were on (4 red and the middle white) the middle light did not blink at all, it was very bright and the red lights seemed to dim slightly. i lost sight of the lights as it became very overcast and the lights were flying just above the clouds. \r\n\r\nwhen i first seen the lights and realized i was looking at a ufo of sorts, i became very excited as i am a sky watcher and am very interested in ufos and the unknown. my reaction was to keep looking up and pay close attention to everything that was happening, so that i could recall the even in detail. after my fiance and friend witnessed the second set of lights take off, they both entered the house as they were both paranoid to stay outside any longer. once i finally entered the house, i was surprisingly calm and collected after observing the light anomalies. (this was not the first time i have seen strange things in the skies. i have had 7 other accounts of strange objects and lights that i could not explain over my life time, and most of them have been in the past 5 years)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:40:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":71097,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.9224334,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-10032015-0006","longitude":-97.09135409999999,"occurred":1443388800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Manitoba","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1443864191000,"summary":"I observed 2 individual lights moving around in the sky for approximately 40 mins","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"r2k 0z1","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5,"locationName":"Winnipeg, Manitoba","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:5387"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Rose City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"As i was watching a show with my daugter i was disturbed by a light in my eyes, i thought it was my daughters cell phone and as i thurned to tell her to shut her light off i realized the light was coming from out side behind her.\r\ni then thought what the heck?
