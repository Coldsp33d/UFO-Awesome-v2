relaxing and sometimes i spot things then before i realize i am just standing there in awe i run to find a phone or a camera and usually i miss getting a picture. this time i got pictures.It was white and shinny, it hoovered, then made some very quick moves kinda zig zagging i kept snapping pics because i wanted to catch the movement in sequence but when i loaded them only about 3 turned out the rest were black images, my feelings were it was not of this earth but i am not an expert in this, i just love to observe and learn, at first i thought it was just a very bright star until it moved around then i knew it wasn't , it did not look like any plane i have ever seen. and had 2 huge appendages out the top and a hook looking one to the side, i have never seen a plane like that, it reminded me of a cats ears except for the hook to the right.I lost sight when it zoomed quickly up ... straight up not on an angle like planes do. one things a few got this pink screen as well and i made no adjustments to my camera it really doesn't have many features just zoom in or

object.\r\nthe hair on my neck stood up. felt electricity. it appeared to be looking directly at me. it hovered silently about 20' above the ridge. it must have been 4-12 feet wide. it was oval with

precision of a hummingbird the object suddenly zipped off behind the ridge out of my sight. i was hoping this was a drone. perhaps a corporate security drone, or a surveillance drone for government. i'd like to know if any other reports coming in from nine mile canyon. if there is any more information about this i'd like to know.\r\nwhat i saw was real. i was not under any influences of alcohol

to disappear. it was flying towards the atlantic ocean. i was awstruck as i saw the craft. i tried to get my wife to come out to see this thing but by the time she got there it was too far away to

empty of furniture, and as a kid thing me and my brother, a year younger, were spending the night sleeping in our sleeping bags in mom and dad's bedroom. we slept at the end of the bedroom that had a sliding glass door opening onto small deck. since the ground dropped away to a small lake, the deck was elevated about 5 feet off the ground.\r\n  down the ground sloaped to the small lake then the ground rose back up on the other side. a road ran from right to left on the high ground across the lake. i woke up just in time to see what i thought was an ambulance emerging on the road to the right from some trees. i was flashing like aan ambulance and proceeded to move straight from left to right along to road across the lake. where a small dirt road runs from that road to the lake used by fishermen to put in boats, it turned in and followed the road down to the lake. i noticed that under all these flashing lights was a solid object casting a small shadow directly under neath. red and white lights flashing like crazy it came to where the dirt road hits the lake and i figured it was some guy putting his boat in (at maybe 3 am or so) it proceeded to cross the lake moving a few feet above the water and making no sound. when it hit the shore it glided up to that deck, just off the corner off it. it flashed red and whit light a a brilliant white light that was unreal. \r\n  i got up off the floor and started to walk to the glass door, saw my little brother sleeping on the floor next to me, and noticed that the object was shaped like a 10-12 foot tall dull lead kind of top. i got up and walked to it and the next thing i know it's the next morning.\r\n  the next morning were siting at the breakfast table and i said to my parents \"did you see the aliens land on the lawn last night?\". they laughed and i was kind of ticked they didn't believe me.\r\n  that night my brother and i were sleeping back in our bed room still on the floor, and i woke up real late early in the morning and i noticed a brilliant light out side the the window. sitiing on the floor i turned to wake my brother and show him the light but i couldn't wake him and he was stretched out super taught with his mouth stretched wide open and so were his eye and he couldn't/wouldn't close them that is all i remember.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 501 Feet - 1

ice water and looked outside, which is a natural thing that i usually do. i noticed 3 lights in the sky flying in a triangular formation. i've seen many planes here, and there lights didn't look like any plane i've ever seen before. because it was cloudy outside(making the night sky gray) i was able to make out a black outline, however i cannot be certain since it was only there for about 9 or 10 seconds and i was to interested in the lights outside. when i first saw it, i didn't really have any thoughts of what it belonged to, so i looked up \"3 lights in a triangular formation in the sky\" and it came up with a bunch of information on ufo's. i was slightly duds turned by this, but i then returned to watch the movie. i should have noticed my cats strange behavior of running back and forth but i was focused on the movie more. when it was time for me to sleep, i decided to just go on my phone and browse a bit. i heard a high pitched humming sound from outside, but at the same time it wasn't loud at all. i looked outside and saw that the 3 dots were passing by again, but this time they were closer. i only got a glimpse of it for 5 seconds though since there were trees in the way. i don't know anything about aliens or ufos, and it could just be an airplane of some sort, but i still think it's best to ask for some answers then to be afraid of what i saw\r\nthank

the orange lights were very bright not like plane lights which i'm familiar with because i live next to ohare airport in park ridge, il. also what caught my eye was that they were flying parallel to each other maybe about 100-200 yards apart from each other. i thought for a moment maybe they were fighter jets the kind that fly in air shows. but then i noticed the orange light on the right  had hesitation erratic moves not like a steady flight pattern. then the one orange light on the left was trying to keep up with the orange light on the right. then they were trying to keep up with each other at the same speed. when i first noticed the 2 orange lights in the far distance it looked like the were going the same speed but when they got closer the were changing speeds to keep up with each other while still traveling parallel  to each other. at that point my guess was they weren't airplanes. i ran from my parking lot to my patio to get my binoculars. i still could see the 2 orange lights from my patio but due to there path my building started to block my view. so i ran back to the parking lot to still see if i could still observe the 2 orange lights but 1 light was gone and  the other was still traveling south. by then i had my binoculars and saw the object with my binoculars. it was a bright orange ball with a brighter white light towards the center. it was traveling very fast and it was hard to keep up with it while looking through my binoculars. then i decided not to use my binoculars and just observe it with the naked eye because of its speed. then it started to flicker out then disappear. i noticed a small white trail after it had disappeared. a part of me says they were some kind of flares but at the same time what confuses me is that they were traveling parallel to each other and also the movements and speed that they were traveling at raises my curiosity. what were they?","distance":"501 Feet - 1

especially since after today i am slightly creeped out.\r\nat around 7:39 i was with my brother preparing for our halloween horror movie marathon. while watching the movie, i got up to get a cup of ice water and looked outside, which is a natural thing that i usually do. i noticed 3 lights in the sky flying in a triangular formation. i've seen many planes here, and there lights didn't look like any plane i've ever seen before. because it was cloudy outside(making the night sky gray) i was able to make out a black outline, however i cannot be certain since it was only there for about 9 or 10 seconds and i was to interested in the lights outside. when i first saw it, i didn't really have any thoughts of what it belonged to, so i looked up \"3 lights in a triangular formation in the sky\" and it came up with a bunch of information on ufo's. i was slightly duds turned by this, but i then returned to watch the movie. i should have noticed my cats strange behavior of running back and forth but i was focused on the movie more. when it was time for me to sleep, i decided to just go on my phone and browse a bit. i heard a high pitched humming sound from outside, but at the same time it wasn't loud at all. i looked outside and saw that the 3 dots were passing by again, but this time they were closer. i only got a glimpse of it for 5 seconds though since there were trees in the way. i don't know anything about aliens or ufos, and it could just be an airplane of some sort, but i still think it's best to ask for some answers then to be afraid of what i saw\r\nthank

vehicle mechanic with a secret clearance and had earned multiple awards/recognition's) when driving down the road, i noticed multiple lights that were pulsating at odd/irregular intervals.  upon coming to an intersection, i stopped, shut my car off and got out to look at the lights.  there was barely enough sunlight for me to drive without using my headlights.  i stared at the lights, thinking they were army helicopters (blackhawks, quite common at fort drum, ny at the time), but there weren't any flashing lights (red/green to indicate direction of aircraft), they were to close to be flying in any type of formation, and there was absolutely no noise.  if they were indeed helicopters, i would've heard the engines (as there was between 3-8 lights pulsating on and off in a \"v\" shape, staying in the \"v\" shape the entire time, and i was close enough that i would've heard a single helicopter engine, even a smaller one like that of an oh-58 series).  i thought that they might be flares from soldiers doing a field exercise, but flares when launched, will slowly float to the ground, and are a bright white - these lights maintained their altitude.  they weren't planes...Again, no noise and not red/green lights.  besides that, the \"v\" shaped (which was a very wide \"v\") object moved slowly, seemed to stop, turn a little, move slowly, turn a little, move forward.  i swear that it moved towards me, stopped, turned directly to me, made all of it's lights glow, then ascended slowly, as if it saw me and was just slowly \"sneaking\" away, and disappeared.  while i couldn't see any specifics of the object itself (exact color, texture, windows, markings etc.), i could barely make out the outline of the front of it.  it had to be at least 300 feet side to side, if not more.  simply put - i was in awe over seeing it, and not being able to tell what it was.  i knew it was a ufo, as there was/is no other explanation for something that size, moving like it did, and not making any noise at all.  after doing a lot of reading/research, i've learned that military bases are frequently visited by ufo's, which is why, some 18 years later, i've decided to share this with mufon.  hopefully, someone will be able to collaborate this sighting.  i'll include screen shots of google maps depicting where i was, where the ufo was, and the direction that the ufo was heading.  the object i saw was nearly identical to the \"v\" shaped ufo over phoenix in march of 1997.  of course, i didn't realize that until years later, thanks to google images when i googled \"v shaped ufo\", and it came up with a picture and a caption. i'm a professional photographer now, and still have my secret clearance.  and no, i'm not crazy.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
