computer i noticed this odd globe and then started asking the guys that were elk hunting with me what this could be after we all got home and no one can explain the object in the photo. i also had my german shepherd dog with and he didn't appear to have noticed anything like that at the time either.\r\na few days before that me and 2 other gentlemen noticed a flying disc around 30,000 feet in the

noticed what i though at first were two aircraft flying in the same direction almost side by side and i thought that they were very close to each other in airspace and that there was no way that air traffic control would let two aircraft fly on the same path at the same altitude, this now had my full attention as i thought that i was about to witness a mid air crash. however, as i was watching them i noticed that the furthest was actually an aircraft had a vapour trail and the one that was closer to me had no vapour trail and no wings that i could see. it was the same size in length and height as the aircraft and even had the same reflective white colour. the sun was rising behind me and was lighting them up it must have been at the same altitude as the aircraft and as i was watching the object it was sort of jumping slightly ahead of the aircraft but still at the side, it was getting closer and closer and then it did a direct right turn and went above the aircraft. it took a few seconds for it to sink in what i had just seen and first i was unsure, but then quite excited. unfortunately, the low clouds then obscured my view and i do not know what happened. i was disappointed that i didn't get to see what happened then and where the object went to. this morning i even looked out again at the same time and saw the aircraft on its own on the same flight path and nothing else was around in the sky, which made my sighting even more mysterious and exciting. there was not enough time to get my phone to film this, i would have missed the whole thing.","distance":"Over One

factory that has assembled drones for the military the last two years. activity in the area has been increasing of late and i believe this plant is the only reason for this to happen as drones can be utilized as a delivery system for nuclear weapons. i immediately went to get the camera and photograph it but as i was changing it to video mode it disappeared. but when it did i noted that there was an almost imperceptible blur from it's exit towards the east although most observers would have thought that it disappeared. i have been watching the sky off and on since the sighting i reported from july 31st of this year and was waiting for another occurrence i couldn't de-bunk. i should mention that the object was hovering approximately two miles away from the drone plant. i feel it helps substantiate my reasoning for the activity. also, one of my tenant's father was watching the same object at the same time from mcminnville. i urged him to file a report also and he was going to he

but it didn't have the normal lights.  i looked around and saw there were other amber lights like it in a grid, maybe 15 or 20 lights. that was very startling to see.  the lights were evenly placed over south katy between fry road and grand parkway.  the lights were slowly fading in and out, but not in unison, they were not moving.  we pulled over in a parking lot on the north side of katy at westgreen blvd. to get a better look and there was no noticeable noise or heat coming from the lights. after a few minutes they started to slowly move together and seemed to connect.  the lights completely disappeared and a large grey triangle traveled slowly and quietly east/south east towards the city of houston. it was difficult to see the craft because there were no lights on it. it was about 200 feet above the treeline  it was a very large, equilateral triangle that covered most of the area between south fry road and south mason road.  both of us had the very distinct feeling that whatever was in there knew we were observing it so we decided not to follow it.  it was gone from view in 2 minutes, maybe less at that point.

a buddhist stupa located in the middle of a remote wild life sanctuary. the stupa is known as the somawathi stupa and lately it has been drawing huge crowds because of various mysterious phenomena being reported at the stupa such as strange lights or rays of lights emanating from this stupa, mysterious sounds of drums and bells being heard from within the stupa, and even eye witness accounts of other dimensional beings frequenting the place. \r\n\r\nthe somawathi temple authorities have put out a large number of photos showing a number of anomalous events. one document that they have published (see attachment) clearly shows photos of what looks like a flying saucer hovering above the stupa. the same document also shows what looks like an extraterrestrial being showing up in a number of photos.  the being that appears in these photos is about 1.5 feet in height with a large head and a spindly body. it looks grey or greyish brown.  the being seems to have three pairs of limbs (two arms, two legs and somewhere from its midsection it appears to have another pair of small arms/appendages) in some photos the being is fully visible while in some others it appears to be only partially visible. it is amazing how clearly visible the being is, in some photos!\r\n\r\ni have attached here a scanned copy of the document published by the temple authorities showing all the photos i have described above.  the sinhalese text on the document can be translated as follows. the heading reads:\r\n\r\n“the visitation of extraterrestrial beings on 14th february 2014 at 7.00pm, in what looks like a flying saucer, to somawathi stupa which contains lord buddha’s right tooth relic,”\r\n\r\nthe paragraph at the bottom right hand corner reads:\r\n\r\n“photos taken by: resident monk of somawathi vihara, venerbale medhananda, parliament minster jayawickrama perera, and rsident of kadwatha, r. p. gamini ratnakumara.”\r\n\r\n“contact cheif monk of somawathi viharaya in sungawila, venerable pahamune, sri sumangla, who is a retired lecturer and former section head at the university of peradeniya, and secretary of the malwathu oya chapter on, phone numbers 0273279285, 071- 8086040”\r\n\r\nmy first reaction to the photos was that “are these photos photo- shopped?” however, the temple authorities have openly published the names of the people who have taken these photos as well as a contact number to get in touch with the chief monk for any queries about the photos. i guess an analysis of the original photos could reveal if they are photo-shopped or not. in addition to the anomalous photos, there are eyewitness accounts of actual sightings of strange phenomena. so my gut feeling is that there might be some basis to these reports.  i had a firsthand experience myself, on the night i stayed overnight in a facility not far from the stupa, which might be worth mentioning. i went up to the roof top to enjoy the cool night air. it was a very clear night and when i looked up at the sky in the direction of the orion’s constellation, there was a blinking light in the sky. it blinked about every 12 seconds and at times seemed to be hovering in one spot while at times it moved in a very irregular manner.  this was visible for about 20 minutes, then it completely disappeared. myself and two other people witnessed this.\r\n\r\ni would like to pass on this information and the scanned photos in case it might spark your interest, and mufon wishes to investigate further. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":71039,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":8.3451852,"location":null,"logNumber":"LK-10012015-0008","longitude":80.38813329999999,"occurred":1392404400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Central Province","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1443668880000,"summary":"Ufo and extra-terrestrial sightings at a buddhist stupa","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Asia/Colombo","timeZoneName":"Asia/Colombo","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":593,"locationName":"Anuradhapura, North Central Province","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:5725"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Anaheim","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Taking pictures of the eclipse, turned around and saw this opposite (w).

they moved too slow to be birds, and weren't shaped right, and didn't travel like birds.  i pulled over into a gas station parking lot, and got out of the car and grabbed my phone/camera.  the larger object was shaped like a wobbly jelly roll, and all the rest of the objects were much smaller dots/circles.  i first noticed the larger object tumble around in no noticeable direction, but it was not stationary.  then i noticed small black dots around it, then more and more.  two dots stayed ahead of the object, and the rest, about 15 of them or so, moved around, non-linear, but not stationary.  they moved around each other.  they were below and to the left of the larger object.  after a minute, the small dots below the object faded.  not suddenly, but quickly.  the larger object with the two dots in front of it stayed, moving off together.  it was still moving off when i returned to my car and left.  i did take a picture and a video, but not more because it was hard seeing the objects on my phone.  one other lady saw me looking and stopped to ask me what i was looking at.  she saw the larger object and wondered what it could be, but by that time the black dots were all gone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
