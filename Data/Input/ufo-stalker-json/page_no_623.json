video tape for only a few minutes or so. next thing you know after coming in and looking at my video, bobbi and ahmya went upstairs to fold clothes. the clouds passing the \"moon\" reminded me of bats

was like it was completely erased. today is 9/30/15 and it seems like weird things have been happening. cell phones cutting out, my computer went on the blink. my second video from 9/28/15 all the

home. on my way there i saw lights in the sky occasionally. i then saw a ufo with blue lights in the air next to a house. i told everyone in the car but they just laughed but one of my friends saw something blue but he wasn't really paying attention. i was really frustrated that they didn't believe me. i got dropped off home. when i went inside i heard a strange noise coming from a block away. i decided to go check it out since i knew i saw a ufo.  i walked over to where i was hearing the noise. it was coming from an alley in front of my friends house. i saw a ufo! i got scared so i went inside my friends house without permission. i stayed there watching it from the door. this ufo was a different one from what i saw earlier. this one was white and it was shaped weird. and had different color lights around it and on the bottom it seemed to look like a orange and blue light/flame sort of thing. i was so in shock. 1st thing i thought was too get someone here to see it! i called my friend that lived there but they didn't answer. i decided to go closer to get a better view of it. as i walked to the road all it's lights turned off! the only thing you could see was the orange/blue light flame thing coming from the bottom of it. i got kinda scared and started to back away. then it just stayed there and so i went closer to it again. and this time it started to fade! like it was disappearing but i could see where it was. i ran back to my friends house. i looked and it was there again. i tried calling my other friend but she wouldn't answer. this was now like 2:30 in the morning. i stepped outside my friends house and stayed by his garage. all of a sudden i see lights to my right. i look over and i couldn't believe what i had seen. it was an alien! but it didn't look like the type of aliens people picture. this looked like a super advanced technological robot. it was a dark grey/silver with like a stick body and it had two lights as eyes. and it was moving in one spot. i stood there for a bit observing it. it would just move it's head. i decided to get a better look at it by moving away from the fence and so i did. i walked slowly towards the road and that's when it saw me and froze! it's lights turned off and it stood in one position and did not move. i backed away to were there fence was in between us. it remained that way. i went again and this time it became invisible. i went back to the fence and when i looked at it, it was there again. but still remained frozen. it knew i was watching it. i couldn't believe what i was seeing. i was in shock scared excited and nervous all at the same time. i needed to have someone see what i was seeing because i knew nobody would believe me. so i decided to try to call more people to see if anyone would pick up! i called a friend. he answered! i told him to come asap. he asked why what happened?? i told him not to ask and to hurry and come. he came and parked in front of my house. i slowly ran over there hoping the thing wouldn't see me. i kept looking back to see if i would stay there and it did. i went up to my friend and from where we were i pointed all the way where the thing was standing by the alley in front of a garage. i asked if he sees a silver thing over there and he says yes. that's when i told him what it was and everything i saw. he looked at me and was like shut up. i said i was being dead serious. he just stared at it. he looked scared. i told him i could take him to where he could see the ufo but he didn't want too! he was scared but he just didn't say it. all he said was no it's nothing. and that he didn't see anything over there. i'm like you just said you saw the silver thing over there now you can't say you didn't because you already admitted to it. i tried to convince him to come to see the ufo in the alley he didn't want to but at the end he did. i took him to the side of my friends house and pointed at the alley. i told him if he saw the blue and orange lights and he said yes i'm like okay that's the ufo. it was kinda distant from us. but he said those are probably lights. he was trying to convince himself that it was something else. he went back to his car and i followed. i'm like wow you're really not going to do this with me? i thought i could count on you. he said no sorry. i'm like why???? you saw everything. are you really that scared? he said yeah..I'm scared of aliens and all that stuff. i'm like okay i understand i guess i'm just going to find someone else. so he left. i went back to where i was and just watched. i was so amused at what i was seeing. my phone was dying so i went back to my house to charge it. then i went back to where i was without my phone. everything was still there. i was by the fence seeing this thing just frozen there. then all of the sudden i see it's eyes (two lights on the head) start turning on. it was blinking and it looked like it was just waking up. and it just started to move its head around and his arms up like it was stretching. it then looked worried and sad. i thought. is it lost or stuck here? i just stayed there and observed it. i went a bit forward again and i think it saw me trying to get a better view of it so it turned off again and froze. i was upset that my friend didn't want to help with anything. i really needed someone to come. i went back inside to grab my phone to see who i could call. i called my friend and she picked up! i told her to hurry and come and so she did. i did the same and pointed at the silver thing and asked if she saw that she said yes in like okay are you sure you see it. it's right there. my finger pointing at it. she said yes what about it. and i told her everything. she came with me to show her the ufo. shes like are you sure that's it. this was now like 330 am. she said what if maybe it's lights from another house or something. i'm like nope it's not. let's go check it out?? she said that i was crazy and went back to her car. i followed. i'm like please!! she's like we can go in the car but i'm not walking over there. i'm like fine but it knows and it will probably go invisible. so we went and drove around the block and passed by and then it disappeared and that's when my friend was like wow i give you props for this one. then she dropped me back off and left. she wasn't much help. i needed someone to have interest in it and explore this with me or i needed to get it on camera or something because i knew nobody would believe me if i told them. i just wanted evidence of what i was seeing. i then thought of my moms video recorder! i 1st went back to see if it was there and it was. so i went to go get my moms video recorder and i went back and tried recording it but it was hard to tell since it was dark out but it had the bottom lights on so you could see that part of the ufo. and i couldn't get the alien robot thing since it was off and it was dark. i then left. and i regret not doing anything else about it. i regret not doing more further research or anything. because i knew this was a once in a life time opportunity. i maybe be the 1st one to ever see this. maybe nobody will believe my story. i was indecisive on wether i should do a report on a ufo signing page or something because what i seen was crazy and maybe nobody will believe me. they will think its a joke or something. but what i seen was real and i may be the 1st one to ever see what i saw. i may be the 1st on to have discovered another alien species from the galaxy. either way if my report files or not i know someday. someone will come upon this. may be in 1year or 8 or 20 or 300 or 50,000 years but someday someone will rediscover this and everyone will see i was right.

was with also witnessed this.  since then, needless to say, both of us have been sky watching quite a bit more than usual.  about a week ago, my friend came back over with binoculars and told me to look closely at this star.  at least, it seemed like a star.. but it was flashing red and blue and i think white.. but the flashes were so sequential.. it did not seem random at all.  could not quite make out what it was... really, it had looked like a star.. but a big star.. but have not seen it in the sky since.  i looked up star strobing colors on google and was surprised to find quite a few people reporting this, going back to about 2010.  perhaps there were some even earlier than that.  but some people described it like a disco ball... and yes, it could have been described like that.  i am not saying it is a ufo, but i have never seen a star do that.  i know that stars can scintillate colors.. but this looked more like a strobe... or a cop's lights when they pull you over!!!  could this be some sort of satellite or drone?  i just don't know.. but i am sure keeping my eyes on the sky.  of all the reports i have read about such a star like thing, i haven't read any definitive answers as to what it might be!  i watched this star a good 15 minutes, then came in and went to bed.  the next night it was not there.  it had been completely stationary  (that would not be the case if it was a satellite, would it?)  if it moved, i sure didn't detect any movement.. other than the strobing lights.  i would love to hear some feedback on this.  any of you skywatchers out there... check out the stars with binoculars.. and see if you can see anything like this.  i hope it comes back.  it occurs to me that these things could be revealing themselves to certain people.. who are open to it.. because i have noticed many people who have seen a ufo have, in many cases, seen others later on, as well.  what are the odds of that happening?  i mean, yes, once you have seen something, you tend to look at the sky more than before.. but still.. for people to see, not one, but two, three, four.... either they are very fortunate... or hallucinating, right?  always love,

continued to approach each other the one white light soon became three in the shape of a perfect triangle at this point we new this was no helicopter as it continued towards us at a steady pace the three light intensified in brightness almost blinding i then stopped my vehicle with mountains on both sides of me in close proximity and i started to flash my headlight constantly and we both put our windows down and could hear no sound but as i continued to flash my lights the craft was now almost overhead stopped and made an unbelievable left turn not a sweeping turn the now visibly triangular craft dark in color turned on the spot and headed off north the three white lights went of and three dimmer red lights started to flash and it unfortunately disappeared out of our site due to the close proximity of the mountains i would like to add the sky's were clear and a bright full moon was visible and its shape was easily identified on the moonlit sky i can categorically say this was no

back and forth in the night sky. making no sound what-so-ever. the fact that they make no sound to me is the surprising point of interest. because soon after watching them after a while. they would morph, or shape shift into a light pattern similar to a conventional aircraft/possible helicopter. flashing red and white lights. still, i repeat, appearing to make no sound. they do not appear to have any shape that i can make out other then round balls of fire. they would also from time to time dematerialize, or fade out, and at times glow brighter or dim down. the residents here do not seem to pay much attention or be interested in them. they do not seem to be surprised or in shock of what is occurring or they may not be able to see them at all, which i have studied is highly possible for some to see, and others not. on one occasion, during the super blue moon eclipse on august29th of this year. which btw is my birthday. they were everywhere, flying around as if they were normal aircraft. but balls of fire are not normal aircraft. i have a few video clips of them, though i used my smart phone camera to capture the video and did not get a great video. keep in mind when i say them, there were more then one, but i was only able to capture one on film, though i do have other video files of other sightings of the same objects from earlier dates. i plan on purchasing a camera soon so i may hopefully catch a better glimpse of them for future evidence that can be more easily & professionally debunked. \r\n\r\nthe manner of which the sightings as follows: i had pointed down on my calendar the day of the super moon so that i may see it with my father. as we waited for the moon to rise into view, we watched the moon together for a few minutes. i decided to get a better view so i rode my bike a block down to the beach. moments later the orbs appeared. i stood there in excitement for a few minutes then rushed back to my fathers apartment where i was initially before the sighting, to show my father and see if he could see it as well. sure enough he was able to see it, so i pulled out my camera, and began to film from my cell phone. i then rushed back down to the beach to see if i could get a better view, then suddenly when i arrived, it had morphed into what appears to be some sort of man made aircraft. which also made no sound.    \r\n\r\ni will send the video files of the or before and after the morph below. thank you. \r\n\r\ni plan on becoming a member of mufon. for i have been studying this subject for over 10yrs. and have seen, experienced and witnessed multiple sightings, as well as physical contacts of the 5th kind. i have a long huge story. and i wish to share this with the world when i am ready. thank you for making this happen for all
