front deck enjoying the fine mountain weather. at the moment when we were embracing one another, i was looking north westerly at the time, over the top of the hill which is about 100 feet higher than our deck. at an angle of about 45 degrees above the horizon, right about midnight on 9/28/2015, there was a truly brilliant flash of light which lasted about .25 seconds, then disappeared. i said wow, that was different, and my wife turned around and looked up. about five seconds passed and it appeared again. it had moved about an inch (from my standpoint) across the sky. this time it appeared fuzzy, and there was a steady point of white light on it. again it stayed visible for about .25 seconds and disappeared. about five seconds later while we were both looking, it appeared again. it had moved another inch or two fingers held up at arms length across the sky in the same general direction as before. this time it was faint and fuzzy with hints of more than one bright light on it. it lasted about the interval, .25 seconds and disappeared for the last time. right after it happened i studied the angle of its direction as it related to the tall pine trees. i did this for hours, imprinting it on my visual memory. the next day i studied the angle of my front deck as it relates to due north. then i estimated the direction of the sighting as related to my front deck angle. i've lived in southern california most of my life and am familiar with the desert. my best estimate is that it was headed in the direction of las vegas. it was very obvious that there were none of the night time characteristics of normal aircraft such as numerous flashing running lights, that continue without stopping. we have a normal aircraft flight path near us. this unusual event described above occurred in an area of the sky where there is no aircraft flight path, nor was it traveling in a normal direction. there is nothing but open desert, and las vegas in the direction that it was going. to guess its elevation at the time of the occurance would be almost impossible to guess, at least for me. but i will continue to work on the problem.","distance":"Over One

\r\ni had seen a ufo a few months before and was always looking to see another\r\nand after looking this particular night this row of lights was unmistakable \r\ni knew i had to watch\r\nfirst it was one very bright light,and as i watched i could see that there were at least 10 behind it ,like a train\r\ni will try to describe the whole sighting now....\r\nthe small town i lived in was asleep with an occasional car coming through \r\nwith this string of lights off in the distance,i noticed  over a small mountain range to my left,a very large but bright sphere.When a car would come through town,this sphere would desend down behind the small mountain,when the car would pass it would then rise up to its original altitude. like a lookout....\r\nafter a while when all in town was still,the first of the lights way off in the distance left the pack and descended all the way into town.I watched as it made its way all the way to the ground.It hovered right off the ground.On its way down it cornered towards my location and its lights were extremely bright,it illuminated roof tops as it went over them.Dogs were barking other than that it was dead quiet.\r\nonce it got to the ground it nestled in to a small creek bed with small trees i could see that it was hovering close to the ground,and then it dimmed its lights down real low but i could still see it barely.\r\nthen here comes a car...The big sphere over the mountain to my left hid again and the hovering craft backed even deeper into hiding,when the car left the large sphere rose again and the smaller hovering craft kind of moved back in to position.\r\nthis went on for the next hr.Plus,with each craft from the train made its way all the way down,and then hovered,hid,and dimmed down so as not to be detected.\r\ni had to go see for myself,dressed and took a walk to see them up close\r\nwhen i got outside i noticed behind my house,so behind me was another big sphere another lookout. i was scared but pulled to go look...I could now see all 10 small craft   dimmed,hiding but i could still see them\r\none was hovering next to a church rooftop high,very still but i could see small hovering movements. i said here goes,i never took my eyes off of this one craft, as i walked towards it\r\nand got nearer to it,50yrds. it dimmed down to where it was invisible \r\nwhen i walked past and continued its lights powered back up slightly\r\ni found a place to watch from a short distance and could see all ten.As dawn approached and got lighter they were getting less visible until they were invisible as it became light.\r\ni headed back to my house at 630 am,and as the town started to come alive\r\ni looked across the road in a great ravine and see the two lookout spheres low to the ground and floating away no sound,almost looked like big floating bubbles transparent...\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This sighting happened in the fall of 2000, as observed by my mom. she's a highly skeptical person and has a low tolerance for what she calls 'bs', namely ufos, bigfoot, and other dubious phenomenon. i guess she passed that on to me, as i tend to be critical of this sort of thing. she was obviously shaken by whatever it was, but my dad had just died a few months earlier so perhaps that had an effect on her impartial nature. i lay it out here for your interpretation; suffice it to say my final judgement (knowledge of the observer's observational skills notwithstanding) probably falls more on the side of the 'unknown but mundane'.\r\n\r\nmy mom was living alone at the time in the house my sister's and i had grown up in. it was a rather large home easily capable of accommodating five adults comfortably. my father had passed recently as i had said, my two sisters and i had moved out a year or two before, so it was basically an empty nest. it was (and is) located in rural upstate new york on a mountain/hill overlooking a valley, facing another incline some five miles away. on a clear day you can see several of the finger lakes, twenty or so miles away. the valley was sparsely populated with a lone farm located at the lowest point of the valley about a mile away. our back yard was a half acre deep facing downhill and ended in an overgrown field that continued unabated until it reached the farm below. it was very dark at night (not sure if the area has since become built up) with little light pollution, giving an awesome view of the night sky with the milky way clearly visible from horizon to horizon. \r\n\r\ni will add here an additional observation, one that's more anecdotal in nature, but worth mentioning since it was commonly observed by those who lived in the house and visitors. that is, a certain sense of unease during the night hours. this feeling wasn't always there, but when it was it gave one a sense of being watched. i'll chalk that up to perhaps the abundance of wildlife in the area, but i felt it on numerous occasions myself. as children we seldom went out after sundown to play.  i had a friend over once who later claimed to be sensitive to psychic phenomenon; after visiting (during the day) she independently shared her sense of unease and wouldn't visit the house after that point. be that as it may my mom didn't seemed affected by this environment, and had no qualms about living in the home alone while making efforts to sell it after my dad's death. \r\n\r\nmy mom's habit after returning home from work (she was a microbiologist, since retired) was to do basic domestic stuff, have dinner, and watch a little tv before retiring. our tv was located right below a large picture window that gave a great view of the valley and farm below. \r\n\r\non that particular evening she followed her normal routine. the weather was typical of the time of year with no precipitation. she was watching tv when she saw an indirect light in the window, but didn't think much of it, as she attributed the source as being one of the cars that would pass by the front of the house on the main road, usually casting a light on the living room ceiling in the process. except the light was the wrong color, didn't move across the ceiling as a passing car would, and persisted. she also suddenly got that feeling of being watched, that same feeling others had described over the years. she felt the light odd enough to rise and look out of the picture window above the tv.\r\n\r\nwhat she saw she described as a self-luminous deep orange horizontal flattened disc about two feet in thickness and fifteen feet in length. width unknown, but guessed to be in the ten foot range. it had no surface features and was consistent in both color and luminosity, becoming darker towards the ‘edges’, denoting that the object had a smooth rounded pill-shape like say a vitamin e tablet. it appear to be a plasma of some sort (not a true solid), dense and with a 'hard' feel to the surface with clearly defined and stable/rigid edges. she could not see through it. it was floating some three to four feet above the ground, clearing the vegetation it sat above, and at no time wavered from this height. hugging the ground, as it were. its distance was about a half acre away, as it rested just beyond our yard in the field below.\r\n\r\nshe observed it for several seconds, which seemed like an eternity. she said she felt like she was observing something alive and organic, not a machine or vehicle, and that when a few seconds later it sensed that it itself was being watched, it quickly moved off to the left, still above the field but now directly behind other houses on the street, still in the field. it moved off at about thirty miles per hour and was quickly lost to view. she never approached any neighbors about what had happened, but none ever mentioned seeing anything on that or any other night. \r\n\r\nshe never saw or felt the thing again in the months she spent there before selling the house. the best theory she could up with at the time was that it was perhaps related to my recently passed father (aka- a 'ghost'), but she rejected that almost immediately as not only being silly, but failing to fit her observation. at no time did she sense specific emotions from it such as malevolence, curiosity, or pity. it simply had a job to do… and one of those jobs was to not to be observed.\r\n\r\nupon asking her for details on the incident several years later, she steadfastly refused to admit that the event ever took place, or even that she had shared what had happened to her with me in the first place. based on her tone i believe she honestly either can't remember due to the possible fogginess of her memory at the time due to all the things that were transpiring or, less probably, a suppression of the memory altogether. \r\n\r\ni’m no expert, but have read a little so here’s my theories as to what it was, listed ‘most probable’ to ‘least probable’:\r\n\r\nimagination/in the mind – seems the most logical. she was under mental stress at that time in her life. problems with this theory though are that i’ve never known her to exaggerate or be prone to flights of fancy. she’s a very no-nonsense woman with no interest in the paranormal or science fiction beyond the average joe’s level. \r\n\r\nnatural phenomenon – some sort of weather phenomenon, ball lightning, etc. we lived at the top of a mountain and when there’s weather- be it snow or a thunderstorm- we got the brunt of it. her description does paint a picture of something organic with no hint of technology. the trouble i have with this theory is that the description was so specific and even though there’s reports of ball lightning showing playfulness etc. there seemed to be a real sentience to the thing that reacted to be observed at a distance. never heard of ball lightening being so large or elongated either.\r\n\r\nman-made object – obviously too small to be manned (unless a human was inside in a supine position) it could have been some sort of drone or other remote device. not crazy about this theory either, as the level of technology on display still isn’t achievable today. unless it was a balloon. but she described it as appearing ‘thick’ with a good solid mass behind it and had the ability to move vertically from a standstill quite quickly. why would a person or group of people decide to buzz a freshly-widowed middle-age woman living in the middle of nowhere?\r\n\r\nnow we get to the ‘erm, probably not’ categories:\r\n\r\ndimensional craft – same spatial coordinates, different plane or time. not sure how that would work and it would certainly be super-science, but it could possibly account for a history of ‘unease’ felt in the area. don’t really care for this one as it’s too complicated and improbable.\r\n\r\nextraterrestrial craft- although the most attractive possibility and one the heart goes out to, imo the odds of an alien craft are less probable than the ‘dimensional’ theory. i’m sure life is common in the galaxy, but the distances are just too great for me to reasonably believe another sentient race has bumped into our civilization. again we’re talking super-science to cross such gulfs of space and time efficiently; when you’ve reached that level of development it’s my belief that as a species you’re not going to dick around in the woods. and if you are, you’re not going to be seen or sensed by those you’re observing. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

going dark, a bright red light appeared in the east and flew across the sky above us. i attempted to video this event, which was 10:07 pm est, but failed. 5 minutes later at 10:11 pm est, another one appeared, following the same path. this time i was able to record the entire event. it is shaky, but i was able to zoom in for part of it. the images are grainy but you can see something in the video. it was hard to tell just how big these objects were, or how far away they were, but the both were identical and followed the same path, from east to northwest. they made no sound, and there were airplanes in the area at the time, so for reference against the airplanes they were brighter and appeared either larger or closer, it was hard to tell. they appeared to have a spherical shape, and the grainy video shows a pixelated sphere when paused at the point where it was in zoom. there were partial clouds so it is hard to determine if the objects were under the clouds or not. they were very bright and flew in a straight unwavering path. they made no sound, and didn't have any flashing lights. they passed the entire length of the visible sky in just over 1 minute. the video is 1 minute and 4 seconds long, and i probably missed about 10 or 15 seconds of this event while trying to get my camera working. it was fortunate that there were 2 of these, and i got the opportunity to record the second time. we waited around for a while to see if any more would appear, but none did. the objects both flew out of view towards the nw horizon, but became too small to see before they reached it. we temporarily lost visual when they were obstructed by a tree, but could then see them vanish in the distance.

having a hard time processing what i and my husband saw on september 27, 2015 starting events took place at 9pm. i guess i will just start telling you my night and how everything happened. i was excited to watch the moon last night. talking to a good friend outside for awhile at this point the moon was white with a little shading on the left side. after a bit i told her i saw a shooting star. shortly after shooting star i said what in the world was that!! i saw 2 bright lights in the distance. i was facing east. the lights just appeared and shot off unbelievably fast towards moon then disappeared. didn't think much about it but in back of my head i thought that was different. the sky seemed energized. we hung up and i went on with mother duties hoping that with in an hour i would be outside to look at the moon. washed up my 3 month old and put my other kids to bed. everything was going well i was going to be back out by 9. went out quickly and saw no moon. sat down in chair and just started looking at the sky. it was truly a glorious night. the stars were amazing and bright. the moon had just started coming back out and darker red. i told my husband to come check this out cause it won't happen again till 2033. we were just hanging out smoking a ciggertte. that's when i noticed the lights again same path as before. the hubby was like that was cool different shooting star. i said to him that is the second time i have seen the same lights same path. strange! as that second set of lights passed i saw something above me. i still can't process what i saw. it was solid, black, triangle middle, with wings like a boomerang. flying low and passed over my house. i said to the hubby did you or do you see that? he said i am seeing things. 15 min later watching the moon and the sky another set of lights. same path. this time hubby watched them better. he says it was 4 lights heading in direction of the moon but this time they were scrambling in different directions then just disappeared. after lights then another object is flying towards us then changed direction and headed towards moon. once again hubby thinks i am seeing things, like an owl. i said hun that object is bigger than a owl!! so at this point i don't know what i am seeing. are my eyes playing tricks on me??? 15 min later same lights same path. once again object flying over my house again!! we only had our phones and the hubby is trying to get video or a pic. phone's flash not turning off we can't get a pic we can't get video all that is happening is his bright light on phone. this time though the hubby says \"what the blank was that!\" so now we are really watching and wondering at the same time what did we just see again! 15 min later same light same path! once again another object same shape same everything. so now at this point we are are really starting to question each other. that's when i get into contact with my brother. he is in the military a commander in the navy. i told him there is some strange activity in the sky tonight. he says yup it's an eclipse i said besides that. he asks me what i am seeing. i tell him i can't put into words what we are witnessing. i proceed to tell him it looks like a triangle in the middle but wings and solid. the stars are so bright that you can make out a shape. closer to ground than a plane. he asks like a boomerang pointy shape i said yes but some curve to it. i peaked his interest when i told him about the lights in distance than a object would be flying over us or toward us. no lights on this object! he was trying to help me process this. i for one have never been one to say ufo. this has me wondering though!!! is there other life out there in the universe. we we were not frightened in any way, we were more on the aspect of what is this? so as of today on the 28th of september the hubby came home from work and after dinner we went outside to smoke and talk about the day. he said he talked about what happened with two co workers. one co worker said that her boyfriend went fishing on saturday at a place called treasure island, and expirenced a green light of some sort and it ended up crashing. she said that he was so freaked out that he left in mid fishing and high tailed it out of there. then the owner of the store (in rawlins) said he believes and he has had an expirence. he also said though that we are in a flight path to cheyanne,wy. that b2 bombers would fly this path supposedly.Do you think after living in this house for 4 months that maybe o would have noticed this earlier we also live by an airport but no planes took off i did however see a plane in the distance but not where we were seeing these sightings. now i know b2 bombers can fly off radar and lower, but can they fly with out a safety light on the outside like a plane has a red/ green light on them. i guess that part didn't make sense to me. that there should have been some type of light on a wing or the back of this object. i was also informed that b2 bombers are based in missouri. i guess i am racking my brain trying to figure out different logical reasons for what we saw. the lights though i don't know. they appeared out of no where and disappeared into thin air. i don't know what any of this will bring if any answers at all but my brother thought it couldn't hurt to get ahold of you and try and describe what we saw. all i do is think about it and play it over in my head. maybe there is a logical reason and maybe it's something from out of this world. either way though some part of me has a new way of thinking, that maybe we are not alone after all. thanks for your time!

\r\n\r\nit is large in the sky. larger than any star i've ever seen by at least three or four fold. it was hard to tell if it was a large ball of fire or just a ball of light. at times, it looked more solid than others. its pace was slow but steady, on a mission but in no real rush. if you stared at it for long enough it almost looked like it was a ball of light inside of a ball of fire. or there was just a ball of something more solid inside. it was a sight for sore eyes. \r\n\r\nits halfway across the sky when it starts to silently, fade away into the night sky. . i realize i need footage and start scrambling for my phone. i manage a measly three second video of what looks like an orb in the sky. by the time, i look up from trying to get a video the object has completely disappeared. \r\n\r\nmy dad and i are completely baffled. we sit for a minute to wrap our heads around it before i start to work on my car. about three or four minutes later i come out from underneath my car to get something and by chance look up in the sky and again see the fireball! \r\n\r\nthe ball had started back at point a to the lower left of the moon, looking just as it had when we first saw it, as if it had never made its way across the sky and disappeared a few minutes prior. i shouted to my dad and this time as it began its slow journey across the sky i was prepared. i was able to take an almost two minute video of the fireball bright in the sky, moving, and then slowly disappearing. you are also able to see what appears to be a ball inside of a ball. (please excuse my profanity in the second video). \r\n\r\nafter the second fireball disappeared following the exact same pattern of the first we stayed on the driveway for awhile. i continued to work on my car hoping another would return however nothing more did. this is not, however, the first time i have seen unexplainable lights or objects in the sky in my parents neighborhood. just the first time i have ever gotten it on video.

harrogate, north yorkshire, one night i couldn't get to sleep so i decided to look up at the night sky as it was a clear moonless night.\r\n\r\nwhen suddenly an oblong shaped silhouette started blocking out the stars and it grew larger as it approached the dormitory/ single story house where i was living it had 4 bright strip like lights on the base of the object and that dimmed when overhead it moved silently and slowly over head until it vanished over the horizon.\r\n\r\nwhen i reported what i saw the next day i had a surprise visit from the very real men in black, and not in the comical sense of the meaning, they introduced them selves as being from the department of the air force and took my statement down in writing and got me to sign a non disclosure form or gagging order which i was told was part of the official secrets act & it would be a treasonable offense to mention what i had seen to anyone, and that i would be imprisoned if i told anyone in a mental institute, but here i am years later talking about what i witnessed because i don't believe it should be covered up.\r\n\r\nwhile i can't conclusively proof that i saw this object as i have no photos of it i do get flash backs of the event to this day and believe that i saw something that night as i know i am not crazy. \r\n\r\ni also experienced missing time afterwards as i lost track of 1-2 hours in time from when i first witnessed the object to when i recalled it the next day and i remember the tv flickering on and then off as and the lights in the bed room being effected because they also flickered on and off at the same time.\r\n\r\nthe object omitted a static electrical current and seemed to have an electrical/atmospheric haze around the edges of the object.\r\n\r\nalso dogs near by started to bark and other animals like birds in the trees where also effected because they where flying away from trees like they had been scared by a threatening yet nu-seen presence or in-viable electrical magnetic field or pulse wave.\r\n\r\ni don't know if this object could have been extraterrestrial or man made as the object was something i have never seen before in my life and i am a keen aviation spotter as it's part of my hobbies and would know if it was any craft i could have easily identified as i have magazines regarding all known military/civil aviation

seemed to be changing shape in the sky, i called my wife to come observe the object which she came out and observed the object as i did. the object had no set pattern it jumped randomly to different locations across the sky. it was a cloud covered night which made this object stick out even more. the duration of the sighting was approximately 1 minute 15 seconds. we watched it until we lost the line of sight in a grouping of large trees by my house, i adjusted position to regain sight of object but was not in the sky that my wife or i could see. i took three pictures of the object on my iphone 6 and logged the position of the object with the compass on the same iphone. lightning started approximately 5 minutes after we lost sight of the

anything on film that would describe it.  back in 1997 i lived south of tucson in arizona.  i had sold my house in the country and was preparing to move to southern oregon.  the phoenix ufo sighting was recent and i had hoped to go up there to see what i might see, but did not.  one afternoon before moving i took one of my dogs up the mountain behind me (past smithsonian up near observatory).  we hung out to say \"goodbye\" and left to go home, just a couple miles away in elephant head.  as i rounded the corner to the straight away that i would turn right on or go straight down to the freeway there was a large round interior glowing thing ahead, i'm not sure if it was over the ranch or past the freeway ((i-80).  when i first saw it it looked like a miniature version of the moon, then i thought .. a satellite?  then i thought na, ufo. i pulled the over to the right shoulder to look at it.  there was no noticeable noise at that point.  it was warm so i rolled down the window of my acura i was blasted with a very loud noise which startled me.  i looked up, a black helicopter was hovering above my car.  the \"thing\" didn't frighten me, the black helicopter did.  they hovered a minute or so, i hoped i wouldn't hear further from them.  i looked north and saw 2 more black copters hugging the curves of the santa rita mtns to the north.  when i looked back the \"thing\" was gone.  i was disappointed.  i looked north and lo and behold, there it was.  seemed the b copters were after it.  it zinged south/southwest toward arivaca.  i started my car and drove to arivaca road as quickly as i could, but couldn't catch them.  my question has always been, was that an orb?  i heard of a bunch of orbs being seen at that time in mexico city and watched the news trying to see if that was what i had seen, to no avail.  i've been curious but have never seen any film or picture that resembled the craft (i think) that i witnessed that day.  were there other reports around that time?  i couldn't tell you the exact date. i tried to tell my mom about it but she seemed to think i was nuts, i told no one else.  thanks, patty shelton","distance":"501 Feet - 1
