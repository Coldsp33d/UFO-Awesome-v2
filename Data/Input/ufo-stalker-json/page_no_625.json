it hovered but made no sound.  i went back to watching a favorite movie of mine (mad max).  it ended at around 4:00 am and when i looked out the window, the star-like object was still hovering but a little further away.  i decided to get my binoculars and when i looked through them i saw what almost looked like a laser pointer in the sky that changed colors rapidly (red, blue, green, white) and made all different shapes.  i could not see an actual object or craft associated with the pulsating lights but nonetheless it felt weird and i had never in my life seen this object before (and i do a lot of star gazing).  it is now september of 2015 and there are now three of the same objects in the sky (ne) and four in the sky, across from my house (western sky).  they all look identical and all

occasionally going out out to peak at the super blood moon lunar eclipse.\r\n\r\nwhat made you first notice the object?\r\n-on one of the occasions when i stepped out i looked up towards the moon and immediately noticed a bright object silently moving across the sky. i was awestruck but then went into an excited state when it completely stopped at a single point in the sky; that's when i called for my wife. \r\n\r\nwhat did you think object was when you first noticed it?\r\n-honestly i had no idea, i thought maybe it could have been a helicopter at first; however, when it stopped and hovered my helicopter theory kinda wen't out the window. the entire time it was silent, all you could hear are crickets and some cars. i grew up in the l.A. area was used to helicopters, even the ones that had silencing capabilities; those still made a noticeable sound. this object made no sound at all.\r\n\r\ndescribe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\n-i had a pair of binoculars and managed to look it at briefly when it paused in the sky. it had two bright lights alternating green and then red. the light could be seen reflected off only the bottom part of the object. the surface where the light illuminated seemed similar to diamond plated pattern sheet metal. \r\n\r\n-as far as it's movement; the first time i saw it was coming from the direction of the mcdowell mountains heading east to west stopping and pausing briefly in the sky. the movement was pretty linear the first time. after my wife and i wen't back inside thinking it was gone, i wen't back out again. that's when it returned and was heading west to east, my camera did not pick up great detail and the video is shaky because of how zoomed in i was but at one point it was right next to the blood colored moon aprox at 44 seconds in, almost as if it was observing it. it zig zagged a few times in way that would not make sense for any helicopter to to and all while pulsating alternating green and red, it made its way behind the mcdowell mountains and turned a solid red, that is when my camera had trouble picking it up. it stopped in placed and descended directly behind the mountains while glowing a bright red. \r\n\r\ndescribe your feelings, reactions and actions during and after sighting the object.\r\n-i was excited, scared a bit, but overall in absolute wonder. now i am saying this was a ufo as in unidentified flying object. it could be military, a massive drone, or an actual thing out of this world i don't know. all i know is that it was an amazing sight and definitely not what you see every night in the night sky.

wasn't a break in the cloud cover showing a star shining through.  when i realized it wasn't a star shining through the thickness of the cloud, that's when i yelled for my phone and snapped pics.  \r\n\r\ni'm not really sure of possible distances because of the opaque cloud cover.\r\n\r\nthere was no lightning or anything atmospheric like that going on at the time, either.\r\n\r\nat first, it looked like one big, bright light.  then it separated into two.  i thought the third pic was still of the two lights, but when enlarged, it shows a smaller triangle at what i guess is the front with three lights more than the other two images.  \r\n\r\nit moved off pretty quickly.\r\n\r\ni knew i'd seen something which i couldn't easily identify, as far as it wasn't a plane or helicopter.  i was glad i was able to get three pictures of whatever it was, even if i'm not adept enough with my phone to have gotten an actual recording as opposed to images.\r\n\r\nbtw, this was in the bixby, oklahoma area.  \r\n\r\nthank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

has been included.  i had to adjust lighting/contrast to get the v to become visible.  the photo was taken with an iphone and because it was dark outside, it is not too clear.\r\n\r\ni observed the cloud for about an hour as it was stationery.  both sides of the v were identical in length and in thickness.  the \"cloud\" seemed to be separated from surrounding clouds by a clear margin all the way around, as if the v was pushing aside all other cloud. \r\n\r\nduring the hour that i was watching the \"v\", the low level clouds around it would change shape, move away, dissipate and do normal cloud things, except the \"v\" always stood still and always managed to maintain a margin of clear sky around it.\r\n\r\ni was getting tired and went to bed.  around 9:45.","distance":"Over One
