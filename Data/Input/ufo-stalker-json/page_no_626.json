when we noticed the battery light come on. as we headed south for a few miles, the cars lights and electronics were flashing on and off and as we pulled over near mp 168 and the cars lights and engine died. we couldn't restart the vehicle. we exit the car to see if the battery had a bad connection but finally concluded it was the alternator. we then tried calling for a ride or tow but our cell phones had bad service and were about to die. we didn't know exactly where we were and all of us were very disorientated. we eventually got a call out to someone to come get us from coos bay they were on their way. as i look around the sky had never ever seen the galaxies and constellations so clearly like i had that evening. it was incredible. as i look to the south, my eyes immedeitly went to what i thought was a star. i quickly learned it wasn't a star although it could pose like one. it began to make sudden changes in direction and turn abruptly changing color and altitude unlike any thing i have ever seen. i then noticed other star like crafts maybe 15 through out the sky. they seem to be communication with each other. to my left was a mountain and as i look up i saw a pink like light or flash every so often come from the mountain behind the trees. i then went back to the car to let the others know what i had saw they had seen the same and agreed we were seeing ufos. we sat and watched from the car with no lights and both doors open. both my friend and i could see black/grey looking beings move so fast past us to the back of the car. unafraid i got out of the car and went up as close to the craft as i could for a better look. it was hypnotic the way it moved. my friend got out of the  car and came to where i was observing and took a flashlight and shone it at the craft. as she did the craft was coming closer and closer. i told her to stop and sent her back to the car with my boyfriend who was in denial and terrified. i stood there looking for maybe an hour with no noise from craft and no other vehicles came by. my friend and boyfriend said it didn't move and inch. i had realized i had been hypnotized by the craft. i remember looking down with my eyes and seeing little green beings stacked up in front of me as a flash image. when i physically had looked  down at the beings a voice came through my head saying back up hear meaning  look up at the small craft and i realized we were communicating telepathically. they had told me they had no emotions and were not going to hurt us. they said they were there to help something to do with the ocean. at some point i came out of the hypnotic state and made my way back to the car. at that point we were still all trying to figure out exactly where we were when a hiker appeared and asked if we were okay. i said yes and asked exactly where we were and he pulled out his map and said by mp 168. i made no mention of my experience to him but could still see the craft i had communicated with. i went to point it out to the hiker it changed back into a star. as our ride neared we could actually hear the power being recharged back into our car as if a generator was firing up. then our ride pulled up and we left for coos bay as my boyfriend had to be at work. i have digital pictures and an excellent video i would like to share with mufon not the public at this time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

(per i-phone time) last night (sunday september 27th) my brother and i were outside looking at the stars, the milky way was visible. a light appeared above the horizon coming from the north. at first both of us thought of a satellite or an airline flight from spokane to portland. i see many aircraft both during the day and night heading to or from seattle plus the spokane to portland route. i am also very aware of the c-17's, c-141's, helicopters and agriculture spray planes i see on a daily basis. the object was coming almost straight at us from the north ( i checked with the compass on the i-phone) heading south. my best guess of it's speed was somewhat faster than the satellite( i have observed them going from a west to east direction two different times) and those usually take many seconds (20 to 30?) to move from horizon to horizon and this came at us from the horizon in maybe one second. as to altitude i believe it was below an airline flight (28 to 35 thousand feet). it had no sound as far as we could ascertain. because of the airline flights and military aircraft that land at the airport at moses lake i am aware of both helicopter and jet exhaust sounds so i feel i can safely say that it was neither fixed or rotary winged. at that time the two options (satellite or airplane) were still in both our minds but what really stood out was the right angle turn heading west, (again using the i-phone compass), there was no slow down or arc to this motion, it was instantaneous! the object then headed west in the direction of yakima. now it did a different thing, it slowed so we could see it for maybe one second more as it moved away from us but it must have slowed from it's original very high velocity. it had blinking white lights. a few moments later a blinking light appeared in the east, (toward the tri-cities) and while this was nowhere as fast as the original ufo twice this one moved with the strange changes in direction that seem unlike any vehicle, (air,land or sea) that i have ever seen, apparently without inertia. while in the u.S.A.F. i have worked on both the sr-71 and rf-4c's plus working at boeing for 25 years on 767,747 and 777 airplanes. i also have been a model airplane enthusiast since childhood so i feel i know something about how airplanes behave in flight and i can honestly say that this was unusual to say the least. in total i think there might have been 2 seconds to the whole sighting.

ones who sttod pretty much startionary and maybe a mile or more from the next. brighter because they are lower or manye it's a form of rank? how the helll should i know? i was not at all frightened. as a little catholic boy taught we are the center we are the supreame beings nothing else i always just knew that was not so, at 6 years old i think i coined the phrase everyone uses today...\"if it 's only us....Seems like an awful waste  of perfectly good space. bt i digress,  \r\n i wish i still had my canon camera. was stolen. if i had a decent cam i know i can get them because i am seeing them every night since. the more you look its like your eyes train to find them. here is were things kinda got shady....\r\n\r\nthe \"guardians\"  nonly moved to intercept less bright star-craft that were approaching from the east. they had a stand offs, maybe 50 ft apart or more, hard to tell. and this made me laugh too...The \"guardian\" lunged forward a little  and the other backed way the hell up.And left. now something a little more serious. i noticed the \"guardian\" which was located in my 1 oclock position up. started moving south east the i seen others coming from different directions, a craft coming from the east again was surrounded. % min into it the craft looked like when you recorded old tv with a video camera, the lines?? but much faster then....Gone. i don;t know if i witnessed teleportation or utter annihilation. then the \"guardians returned to their post. another thing to note, when ever a plane was approaching all star craft stood dead still. nothing to see here, we are just your heavenly stars, nothing more, soon as the plane passed they moved again. now yesterday got me a little worried. i was seeing 1000;s and 100;s of these things. the accelerated at amazing speeds pretty much over my house to the south east.I seen others that seemed to be chasing something, every now and then i'd catch a bright flash out of the corner of my eye. when i looked, no star, no plane, nothing to cause it. meteors leave trails. this flash was localized . did not illuminate a large portion of the sky but i know it was a bright white color. see these evey now and then, hoping it was not what i think it may be. the thing that has me alarmed is the number of them, if they were here researching or something of that nature they would not need an armada to do this. i studied these crafts for many hours a night. some knew exactly what to do while others moved about as if confused on which direction to go. i believe the orbs are drones of some sore, beause i noticed last night wheree they departed from. picture a star of david. each point was a star-craft. hexagonish shape but moved without any regards to weather it's was upside down, slanted..But i knoticed at times i can see they was indeed a hughe object there but translucent like, when it went behind clouds i seen the shadow. i seen maybe 60 or so of them just tonight. in fact if i go out right now i know i will see something. i have not told anyone about this because i was hoping to borrow a camera / video camera with good zoom to back me up. i know what i saw and i swear on my life it  is as i have told it. tonight look out twards lake erie. more to the west though, actually they are everywhere. they also have the ability to create clouds, like a mist will for and draw in to them and so will small nearby clouds. and sometimes they make large clouds in the matter of about 10 min. i do have some photo evidence. this happened about 2 weeks ago during the evening hours, my eye was drawn to the sky because of the beauty of the sunset and the very odd shaped spider like web clouds, then a large \"contrail\" only looked like it was super heated. did it a few more times. i looked and at the end was a ball of light. sitting there next thing you know, clouds start drawing in to somewhat hide it and i seen other orange orbs coming from seemingly thin air approaching it, but to the west was a very bright lighted orb coming. i kept trying to get my old man to see it so my attention was not always there but next think i knew they cleared out and the ship took off. the camera was given to me, i went to video and got \"out of memory\" doh so tried taking a snap.. again doh so i deleted 3 pics as fast as i could and i did manage to catch quite a bit on them 3 5 mp \"old cmera\"  problem is i cannot find thee drivers for  windows 7 for the life of me. the camera is \r\noptimus 5.0 mega.....Blah blah.....Digital camera  from radioshack.Modle number   16-3879  if anyone knows how to get this working withe windows i will send the pics right away. the more we all loook up, the more we will all see.

kids there so they were off kinda doing their own thing while the adults all drank some beers and chatted. i'd have to say it was around 2030-2100 that i overheard them talking about ufos and playing with my toby's (he's the 11 year old) phone and looking off to the east of the yard just above a tree line. i figured they were playing and paid it little mind. \r\n\r\nabout 5 mins later, toby asked me where he could plug his phone in to look at a picture. we weren't really that familiar with the hosts, so i was hesitant to go looking around for outlets and asked him what picture. he immediately showed me and said that he and his brother just watched a ufo. they said it hovered just above a tree in the neighbor's yard and then shot out of sight right after he took the picture. \r\n\r\ni humored them and did the dad thing, like \"oh... yeah? very cool! let me see?\" \r\n\r\nwhen he showed me the picture i immediately changed my tone. i asked him to show me exactly where he was standing and where he was pointing his phone when he took this picture. the area he was pointing it had now street lights in the field of view and i could faintly make out the exact arc of the tree giving a point of reference. you'll notice to the right an arc coming down from the top right corner of the image to about 1/3 of the way across the bottom- this perfectly corresponds with the tree line as seen from the back yard of the host. \r\n\r\ni showed it to some friends at the party and they all kind of dismissed it since it was in fact a party and they had more important discussions and drinking to attend to. \r\n\r\nno one else witnessed this. no one heard anything. as far as i know no one else experienced anything out of the ordinary. \r\n\r\nmy boys were excited, and they are very honest with me, objective and always well-behaved. i have no reason to believe they were doing anything but honestly watching a ufo. and the picture, with it's shape and where the image was located... that all gave me chills.\r\n\r\ni have no clue what it is, my son took it on his phone. the phone is a samsung galaxy 4 mini. he text me the pic after he took it so i can't account for any resolution loss or image changes in that process. i have no problem allowing access to that phone for the original pic if need be, as long as he gets his phone back in tact. \r\n\r\nthanks for your time, hopefully this will be fun!

south of minden in 1988. witnessed by 3 very skeptical but shocked adult witnesses.\r\nviewed at middle of lake from private island owned by multimillionaire industrialist. still owned to current date. as actual and true that this report is i am taking over 25 years to report this.Only talked among us three eyewitnesses over the years and family.\r\n\r\nreputable people. full time paramedic, former school english teacher and industrialist wife now over 80.\r\nthe three of us were playing a game of hungarian kanasta in diningroom of cottage middle of lake on island.\r\nindustrialist wife noticed 1st some strange flashing white lights 1 mile away at gull rock a landmark rock middle north end of lake occupied with seagulls 100s only. however just lost electrical power in whole area minden , lake and south at moores falls. we all moved to pantry off kitchen to continue observing lights maybe now minutes past midnight. was this just a small plane in trouble by gull rock.No way.It was also raining mildly with periodic periods of intense flash lightning.Suddenly a brilliant orbe probe of steady circular white light like a mini moon shot up from left and right sides of strange flashing lights by gull rock.  both brilliant mini moons went up 300 feet and began crossing lake up and down sometimes above below or stopping on top of each other. lasting 5 to ten minutes.Also at same time behind sparlings island was .4 mile long halo of weird white light at that time in swamp land diminished at top of halo but very bright behind island. also this light halo huge was shifting back and forth slowly. another one looked like a big shifting halo behind moores falls at moores lake.Yet no hydro on anywhere a massive outage.\r\nnow i wish this could end here but it does not. the three of us two female adults and a male decide to leave pantry and go to end of northside island dock with a single beam flashlight.All huddled together under rain or tarp.\r\nsuddenly our strange lights fantasy turns to frank reality when we saw an amazing undeniable incident occur. i started flashing the mini flashlight off and on at docks end.Suddenly without warning at incredible speed travelling one mile in a few seconds a huge dark grey half football shaped \r\nobject raised above gull rock responded to our light and in 2 seconds or less was hovering only 100-200 feet tops in front of us at end of dock.Shocking,impossible but yes only 50 75 feet away.Encompassed majority of front of island a football field in length.No noise no hum nothing but huge. no windows no alien things nothing observed.However something responded to our flashlight and was observing us. what now appeared. only at the bottom of this half football dark object clearly visible especially after a flash of intense lighting, was turned on suddenly a series of white,green and red triangular 3 foot rotating sections of bright coloured light spinning slowly.Nothing at top.I continued turning flashlight off while 2 females looked in shock at craft.Then suddenly only left side of craft turned on its mini moon of light and started randomly signaling us for 1 minute.Wife of industrial yelled for me to shut dame flashlight off be we are scared.I shut off flashlight for good. quickly after left mini moon light shut off the craft within 1 minute went back to gull rock in water within 1 second one mile. no noise , no hum nothing.This object 1n 1988 not from this world. after returning to gull rock right left lights of mini moons appeared went 300 ft up and keep crisscrossing lake for 10 minutes.Suddenly mini moons went back to craft at gull rock turned off.Something at a great speed like a flash went to right side of lake behind sparlings island by shallow swamp.Suddenly mini halo .4 of a mileof energy light diminishes until not visible. a rapid flash of light with a reddish trail shots straight up into atmoshere until no longer visible with naked eyes. incredible rate of speed with no noise or sounds. interestngly rain stops and flash lightning clears.Still no electricity on lake or area.\r\nnext day observation maybe 2-5 seagulls left on gull rock not usual hundreds.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"01:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

clouds\r\n\r\nthis ufo *scanned* the area like something i have never seen before. i have never seen a ufo before and this was one of the craziest things ive ever seen. \r\n\r\nit is the night of the lunar eclipse-the blood moon eclipse that only comes around once every 20 years. i think this has bearing on the sighting. \r\n\r\ni was on my way back from bridger mountain rd. coming back into bozeman, and at exactly 8:40pm on the left in the sky above the tree line but below the total cloud cover was a large green orb hovering. the distance id have to check because it is very hard to tell how far away it was in the dark, but when go back during the day, i will be able to gauge the actual distance. maybe...It was a half mile away. it didnt do anything for about 10 seconds. then like wow...From about a half mile away a beam of green light literally scanned the whole area, but only on the land part. it lasted for about 5 seconds, then stopped for another 3 seconds and scanned the land for another 5 so seconds. as if it was looking for something downed in the area. there is like nothing out were it was scanning, except for forest and maybe a house or two. the scanning beam is freakishly i almost want to say high-tech. from where it was to where it was able to scan was a very large distance, and even the actual beam of light showed almost an electronic pattern. this beam was a concentrated beam like most ufo sightings you hear about, but when it scanned farther from its own distance, the beams range of light pie'd out. this part is hard to explain. im an artist so a drawing would be best. not only did it scan a green light, but when it did, when the green beam was hitting the landscape, it wasnt even like a monotoned green light, it seriously looked like that light was making a design within that beam. like the design a motherboard has for a computer. like it was trying to pick up a computer sequence is the best i can do to explain it. the scanning lite up the whole valley when it happened. remember, it ws cloudy, and no moon and i was in the middle of a forest with very little lighting. after the scanning it there there only for 2 seconds and then gone. there was a car behind me, and they have got to have seen it. i was just amazed at the range this thing had and how it wasnt just a beam scanning, it looked like a computer system trying to locate a chip.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
