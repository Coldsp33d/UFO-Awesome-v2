around 8:30 with my mother and brother. half hour later i heard a sound overhead like an airplane but it was too low and flying slow overhead. i looked up and directly overhead it was like a triangle/boomerang shape in a light but dark (muted) color than the sky flying straight north overhead. i would say over 1000 feet. there were 6-7 lights and illuminated almost rhombus-like shapes when it was connected. it then transformed and i pointed up to show my brother and mom. only my brother saw it. \r\nthe rhombus shapes disappeared at this time. the lights morphed or squished together into a roughly shaped circle and then went over the trees, disappearing. i tried to run into some clearing overhead to follow it but i lost visual. my mother did not see it that time. i only saw it for maybe 5-7 seconds overhead. my brother noted that he did not hear the airplane like sound, which caused me to look up.\r\nabout 3 minutes later i saw it again flying southeast from the north through the trees and then into the open sky up ahead. i pointed high and my mother followed it with me as i ran quickly down the street.\r\nit was barely visible. the lights were nearly impossible to see, but i saw it for about the same length of time as the first, give or take a few seconds more. \r\nthere was the familiar triangle/boomerang shape floating through the sky and i could not hear it this time. i also say 'boomerang' because it was like a very wide v, yet squared out. it faded into the sky overhead going toward the moon. my brother did not see this occurrence but my mother did.

a triangular fashion in that as one faded out the next would light up and so on completing a triangle motion, we couldn't see an outline or anything just the lights, they didn't progress across the sky and appeared to be stationary, it was impossible to estimate an altitude as obviously there is no reference point to base it on, it was also impossible to guess its size except to say that if it was one craft we were looking at it must have been huge, we watched them for a couple of minutes when they extinguished completely and we didn't see them again although at that time we fished that

appearence. within 30 seconds it was long gone. the coast guard was flying manuvers in the area all weekend from what i understand.\r\nthe orb traveled in a straight line and didnt waiver flying faster than any plane i have seen at that altitude.\r\nwe were stunned when we saw this thing and didnt know what to think, still dont, never seen anything like this before. so far no one else saw anything. i heard the helicopter manuvers were because of the popes visit to the us.\r\nwe lost sight of the orb over the horizon. we dont have any photos or pictures. we didnt have time to pull out

windham ohio we both observed seven(7) amber colored star-like glowing objects hovering in the sky in front of us. at first i thought they may have been helicopters flying in formation as we often see in the area due to the nearby ravenna ohio arsenal. upon closer observation i could see that the objects did not have the shape of a helicopter or plane, display the usual lights, nor produce any audible sounds as planes and helicopters do. the objects seemed to hover then move slowly off in a noth-westerly direction. one object was very low to the treeline and shined the brightest. the driver asked if i would like her to pull off the road and stop. being it was dark and we were the only car on a long lonely stretch of country road i advised her to continue to drive slowly so i could see which way they were heading as i felt a bit uneasy and not sure what the objects were or what the low flying one may do if it was an actual \"unknown\" craft and decided to pursue us. we continued to drive in the direction in which they were heading but eventually lost sight of them as the view from the road was poor due to the high trees. i am a mufon field investigator and also am affiliated with several other cryptozoological and paranormal groups in the area and can say that the area has had it's share of reports of ufos, cryptids and hauntings some of which i have investigated myself. i would also like to note that i have seen my share of chinese lanterns and drones in the past and the objects we observed did not move nor look like either. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The events took place in summer of 1978, a saturday or sunday afternoon in june or july. i never recorded the date but it was a warm summer day with blue sky and a few low white cumulus clouds, so the exact date could probably be found from weather records. there was no wind.\r\n\r\ni visited speke hall near liverpool with the intention of doing a hand drawing of the hall, so i was lying on the grass west of the hall, looking towards it.\r\n\r\nthe hall is adjacent to liverpool john lennon airport (then just known as speke airport as he was still living). there were aircraft coming and going throughout my visit. the runway is south of the hall, between the grounds and the river mersey. the object i saw was obviously smaller and closer than any of the aircraft.\r\n\r\nbecause i was looking at the hall roof i was looking skywards and so noticed the sun glint off a shiny object then quite near. it was shiny in the sun and grey when shaded by cumulus cloud. it was silent.\r\n\r\nthe track of the object was from east to west, approximately parallel with the airport runway. the track was straight and i estimate that it must therefore have passed over the wirral and mersey estuary before flying over speke hall where i saw it, then the path would have taken it on over hale towards runcorn.\r\n\r\ni estimate that from the time i saw the object almost overhead, to the point where it became too small to see was no more than 10-12 seconds. if i had taken my eyes off it in order to ask someone else if they saw it then i would not have found it again. in any case there was no-one within many feet of me. there were dozens of people around but i saw no sign that anyone else had looked up and seen it - as i say, i only saw it because i was looking up at the roof while doing my drawing.\r\n\r\ni would describe the object as about the size of a rounded-off oil drum or dustbin, shiny and featureless, flying with long axis vertical. shaped approximately like a capsule that you might get from the pharmacy. there was no obvious indication of how it was propelled at such speed.\r\n\r\nit was not a balloon. there was negligible wind and the track of the object was straight direct and controlled.\r\n\r\nat the time i thought little of it, but thought it must be some secret technology of usa or russia (or perhaps british - it was after all flying over liverpool) there were no drones in 1978! since then i have come to realise that even today i know of no technology that could propel a craft in such a way.\r\n\r\nsome time in the 1980s i sent a report of it to an author named jenny randles who wrote books on ufos and gave an address in wallasey, merseyside - but she never replied. i did this because in one of her books she described an egg shaped object seen near liverpool.\r\n\r\nmore recently, i have seen a tv program called 'top ten mysteries and conspiracies' and about 43 minutes into that program is a clip of an object exactly like i saw, but viewed from an aircraft. i have tried but been unable to find the source of this clip.\r\n\r\ni make this report belatedly in case it matches with any other reported sightings. since this was a daytime sighting in a populated area it must surely have been seen by others that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

driving back along the motorway (highway) a55 near babell i think. i was looking out of the car window up to the sky as i liked looking at the clouds and then as i looked over towards the trees i noticed what looked exactly like a fur tree but stood in mid air must have been about 500ft in the air just sat there not moving whilst i was just caught in a gaze looking at it i just kept on thinking and wishing for it to come closer i was also thinking that if it was a ufo then they chose a horrible camouflage as it just makes it stand out. then i quickly turns to my grandma and told her to look and she told me that it was probably just a plane (she didn't turn to look) but i knew it wasn't a plane as no plane looks like a tree or just sits there hovering i knew it had to be a ufo as i have always been fascinated in space and other planets. i tuned back around and carried on looking at it still in the same place not moving an inch but this time i was looking through the back window of the car as we was driving away from the object i tried to take a picture of the object with my phone that i had at the time but it turned out too blurred to see. and just watched as we drove away from the object. the whole experience left me feeling excited and happy and hopeful that one day whoever is controlling the ufos will come out of the shadows and show themselves to the world and help us with technology in all of its forms. \r\nsorry for any rambling.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
