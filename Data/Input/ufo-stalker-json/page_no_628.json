the orbs flashed multiple colors and then just seemed to vanish almost like they were cloaked. the triangle shaped lights remained for roughly three and a half minutes and then they began to slowly dip downwards. they seemed to descend for two seconds before zipping straight upwards and seeming to completely vanish from sight. during the encounter i pulled my phone out and was going to try and take a video. unfortunately my battery had just up and died (i'm assuming the craft had something to do with it being there was a very high pitched noise along with a hum/buzz noise all through the

(was observing them from stationary position in parking lot at that time ). they remained equidistant, reminding me of the 'black triangle' i saw years back,  but if that's what this was,  it kept one corner above cloud cover the entire time i observed.  we then headed east  where i lost sight of it/them. the lights remained localised to one area, as if they were doing aerial reconnaissance  (like search helicopters,  but silent, and only one big light per 'object' instead of the several lights typical of normal aircraft. i  would say they were planets,  if  stars would have been visible and they didn't move so intelligently. would have taken a photo but niece was playing minecraft on my phone.  plus i would have needed optical zoom to get anything decent.  my cousin said airplanes would not change direction like that. can't judge distance without knowing exact size,  but i know where we drove and we drove on east and west of it, and right 'under', so i have a pretty decent estimation

minutes, looked again and it was high above the tree to the right of our cabin, hovering. no pulsating, no sound, bright, solid orange. we watched it make a slow path back to the rim of the mountain and back to the tree a few times. at this point i called for my dad and husband, neither came out, again the object moved to the tree as previously done, however it shifted course dramatically and very, very fast and i went out front to find it with no luck. i rejoined my mom on the back deck, at this point we noticed searchlights all over the sky, clouds had begun to move in by then so the searchlights were easy to see due to the reflection, finally my mother said this is very odd, i don't know what that was, and went in the cabin, the searchlights continued for about 10 minutes. we both strained to hear any sounds, initially we thought of a helicopter, but the behavior and the lack of sound voided that theory. this has been bothering me for a while now, the fact that my mom agreed something was odd struck me, for my peace of mind i needed to get other opinions and share this incident, if there is a qualifying answer to what we witnessed i am all ears. i do regret that i did not have a camera with the capacity to take night pictures. i have tried all i can think of to disprove this but i am stumped. from some crazy fireworks, to a meteor, it just does not fit into

elevation 1000 feet. house located on three acres. two large windows in my living area,from sitting on my chair, i can see to my left through the  west window and in front of me the north window. while watching tv, i saw a very large \"orange\" light traveling west to east through the trees, approximate one mile out 2,000 feet elevation. i've seen hundreds of air craft (planes/helicopters) over the years(from my yard or through the house windows. i've seen bright white lights, green and red marker lights attach to them. this sighting in the corner of my left eye i could see the orange light out my left window traveling slow to the west.  it was large like a basketball size, not like small directional lights of aircraft. it came to view through my north window. my first thought was a meteorite passing,but,no tail? gosh that's slow,then i thought wtf is that! i ran to my west side exit door, to the front to my house onto the deck and watch the slow moving orange bright fuzzy basketball size light traveling slow.\r\nthe trees in the area were at times blocking my view. i thought to myself, to slow for a aircraft, no noise of rotor blades of a helicopter. this event lasted for ninety seconds to one hundred. i thought about calling the locate police dispatch office to see if any one call in but decide it was a non emergency. i violated that call. it went out of sight due to the tress and the low elevation with it having a slight decent to it. it's speed could be around 50 mph. i'm sixty years of age. afterwards i thought to myself \"that's the first\". the following day, i search the on line and noted very similar sightings on your sight in my area of fifty miles range.

outside to my backyard with my dog to have a cigarette. i walked up to the hill ( 4 steps off the deck ) and i looked up to the sky ( the sky was that blue night sky not dark black) i see this huge what appeared like a star but was massive and so close. i knew 100% this isnt right and just then all these pink tesla ball tentacles started coming off of this \" star \" looking thing and within a second - it seemed as if this \" star \" turned inside out of itself and i could see orange and blue lights merged together and wham! i see this dark shape with lights ( not blinking ) coming towards my house. i never once took my eyes off of it and as it went over my house i could see the bottom and full shape of the object. it was in the shape of a row boat /bullet. it 100% had no wings or tail. the lower bottom had two lights that were peach orange and in the shape of those cement park barriers that lay on the ground in a parking space - they were vertigo - one on far left and other on far right. above these two lights was a large circular ball light of blue. none of these lights blinked at all and stayed on. the craft gave off a sound that i unfortunately can not describe because i have never heard a sound like that to compare. i thought there was something wrong with it mechanically because of sound but perhaps that is the way it sounds normally..I really don't know.\r\nit was the size of a large building and moved slow but steady over the house.\r\n\r\nwhen the object went over me i could feel a numb sorta tingly feeling within both arms, neck and my head. what i found strange is that i knew it was a ufo but i just all calm like walked back into my house looking at my arms and thinking \" they are real \" i felt this sensation for 1hr and 9mins.\r\n\r\nalso when i came in the house i looked at the time and no more then 2 mins had passed. i drew the craft and wrote some details within a minute of being in the house.\r\n \r\ni have been feeling since that night what must be post traumatic stress.
