springfield. moonless, dark clear sky, tons of stars visible. flat, two lane highway no other vehicles or any kind of lights except one...\r\n\r\n2. i was doing about 60 and eventually came to the realization that our car was not yet alongside a bright white light that i estimated to be about one mile ahead, about 50 - 100 feet to my left and about 50 feet above the highway. \r\n\r\n3. at first i thought it was a relay tower and didn't pay any attention to it.\r\n\r\n4. i'm guessing 4 - 5 minutes passed after i first noticed the light and then realized it was still about a mile ahead. i began watching intently and after a couple more minutes it still appeared to be a relay tower a mile ahead so i pointed it out to my wife. we watched a few more minutes and nothing changed... same brightness, relative position, etc. suddenly the light shot upward at an angle of approx 50 - 60 degrees at tremendous speed. in about five seconds it appeared to be among the stars. i glanced at the road quickly then looked for it again but all i could see were stars. my wife also lost it among the stars in less than ten seconds.\r\n\r\n5. for me, this was the biggest wow moment of my life! all the usual explanations did not apply... stars, planets, meteors, satellites, airplanes, birds, weather balloons, etc. the light was in view for about ten minutes and appeared to be moving at the the same speed as my car for about ten miles.\r\n\r\n6. i was especially excited because my father got me interested when he used to talk about a metallic saucer shaped object hovering in the sky one afternoon in phoenix, az. this was during the late 1940's when i was about five. several people watched the object outside a grocery store for at least 20 minutes before we finally left and went home to put the groceries away. \r\n\r\n7. i decided to submit this report after all these years just to beef up mufon's data base. i would also be interested to know of any similar sightings.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

daylight, around 6:30 p.M.  my back porch faces east, and although we are just north of tampa, we have watched shuttle launches across the state a canaveral from there.\r\n\r\nas i opened the screen door to walk out to the backyard i saw a fireball in the sky a bit south of where we have seen the launches.  there was no noise.  at first i thought it might be a rocket gone bad although i hadn't heard of any launches scheduled for that time.\r\n\r\ni have seen the video someone posted of this same event, glad he caught it (mufon case#37553), although it seemed to me that the flight path was more south/southeast than north as he reported.\r\n\r\nthe object was very far off: approx. 150 miles from us and must have been many miles up.  however, it wasn't following any of the familiar flight paths of the planes we see daily.  it also looked to be far larger than a plane since we only see contrails of planes flying that far east of us.  we don't really see the shuttle itself, just the fire of the rocket and its trail.  this was clearly a big, flaming object hurtling across the sky\r\n\r\ni called my two boys out to confirm what i was seeing, they're younger and have better eyes.  they both confirmed it was a fireball, they claimed to be able to see it flaming.  they both insisted if was not a plane.  it was a flaming ball like object with a tail of fire leaving a single, irregular smoke trail, not the straight parallel lines of a jet.\r\n\r\nit was never reported about on the news or in any meteor reports.  i just now came across the other person's video of this on youtube and

morning i observed a plane spraying a trail with another plane following directly behind it, apparently within the trail. i photographed this. a check on flightradar24 later revealed the planes to have been within a kilometer of each other which is something that i have never observed before and which i believe to be against aviation protocol.\r\n\r\nanyway, i continued my walk. when i see \"chemtrails\" i am prone to looking up at them and muttering about them. the dog is well used to this, i think!\r\n\r\nwhen i was returning back up the road on which i live at approximately 07.45, i was doing my customary grumping and glancing up again at the \"chemtrail\" which had been left by the two planes i saw a glint of light. the sun was to the east and still quite low in the sky and it appears that the glint could have been sunlight reflecting off of the object.\r\n\r\ni switched my camera to video mode and captured brief footage of an object emerge from the \"chemtrail\", make and

east of la porte,indiana where hemp was grown during ww2.He said this land we would search pot for was a potato farm. we arrived at a side road adter 1:00 am in the dark ,star filled sky. there was about 1 or 2 inches of frozen snow on the field that had been ploughed under for winter. we walked and stumbled across the uneven frozen ground ,crunching the snow as we walked.Dave stayed with the car. we each had a flashlight to search the ground. we came to a small rise ,a hillock of sorts,where weeds were blowing in the cold breeze, shined our flashlights around there, but found nothing. after about 10 minutes of looking we decided that winds and cold had ended the search and started walking back to the car ,and dave. i started to run since my jean jacket wasn't keeping me warm. i suddenly bumped into something at knee height. i turned on my flashlight and there right in front of me and looking up with big eyes where two small deer. they didn't run off as we approached. the deer looked away from my face and back toward where we had just come from.I looked too. to ed's and my amazement there was a column beam of pure white light shining down and illuminating the weeds where we had just left! the deer and us were temporarily transfixed on the sight until i heard the small deer trot away from us ,with the snow crunching under their tiny hoofs.I asked ed,\"ed..What do you see?\" he replied,\" one bright light beam shining down where we were!\" we clicked off our flashlights and ran at full speed back to the car! it was very scary to see a light beam from nowhere and shining so brightly in a potato field of all places. the light beam was about 150 feet from us,about 80 foot in height with no visible craft or noise involved.It never wavered and was straight sided from the top to the bottom at vegetation. it will always be a mystery to me and ed about what carried or shined that light beam down as if it was searching for us or the

ave. along the dunes of lake michigan,in michigan city,indiana. the year was 1977 and it was late summer(about august 28th). we always took our black lab,kahlua, for her evening walk to the dunes before bedtime.We simply cross the street and enter the dune trail where she roams the sand to do her thing. it was about 10:00 pm that night when i took kahlua on her leash,across the street and let her off it. she did not run into the dunes like normal. she stood at my side with one front leg up,tail straight out,and the hair on her back stood up. she was pointing toward the beach opening of the dune trail we stood at. this was odd because i had never seen her do this stance since the day we brought her back from california, the year before.She was a well trained and very good behaved dog. i looked to the path end and saw a shimmering glow coming from around the end dune. i thought it was our neighbors whom often built a bonfire and drank beer on the beach when it was deserted.(this isn't permitted now ..But happened often back in the 70s.) i put kahlua back on her leash and we ran to the beach opening,expecting to see some friends and neighbors. it was deserted and no light was nearby. i looked left (west) toward the lake pier, and was amazed to see 3 spheres moving our way just above the gently rolling waves on the sand.There was a breeze blowing in my face off the lake (north). i looked down at kahlua and she was watching the approaching spheres to our left. the hair on my arms stood up and i noticed by feeling that kahluas back hairs were still up.It was eerie as the 3 spheres approached our spot and they were clearly visible. they slowly moved in an echelon formation (like jets do) and they were just above the waves on the shore sand. i could see the foam of the water being illuminated by the light the spheres gave off. it was similar to a fluorescent bulb light type of glow.The surfaces of the orbs were yellow glow with small fingers of pink or orange lightning running around the entire globes.They reminded me of those science class balls that create static electricity.The glowing orbs were about 3 feet across and the same distance apart from each other as they traveled.They slowly moved past us about as fast as a person can walk.All was quiet except for the breeze blowing past my ears.I looked down and kahlua was watching them go to our right.We were about 100 to 110 feet from the crafts / shoreline when they passed us.They continued east following the shoreline ,becoming one light source due to distance, until they disappeared in the far distance. i then ran back home with kahlua and told my wife what happened.I asked her how long i had been gone and she said about 15 - 20 minutes. i called the police in michigan city the next morning and they laughed and said it was probably airplane lights and hung up. i guarantee that this was no airplane lights or airplane. that is my first encounter and i will send you another here,my second and last sighting.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
