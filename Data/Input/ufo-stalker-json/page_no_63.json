clouds then emerge out and move slowly across the sky for about 1-2mins, then it came to stop and sped off at an unusually fast pace and dissapeared. whilst this was happening we were asking eachother could it be a plane, or helicopter but it did not follow any of the usual patterns. we are used to lots of helicopter/drone activity here in derry due to the troubles but this one has baffled us. it

bright light, which appeared to be hovering in the distance, on the left side of our property.  he then pointed to the opposite side of our property and there were between 5-7 very bright lights, which also appeared to hovering.  when scanning from the right side of our house to the left side, you could clearly see they formed a semi circle around the area.  since there were some trees obstructing our view outside, we ran inside to a large window in the dining room on the side of the house.  from there, we were able to get a very clear view of the lights to the right of our house.  none were moving, all appeared to be hovering.  we questioned if they were perhaps planes, but again, they were not moving and there were no additional lights on them.  also, i'm sure planes would not even be allowed that close in proximity to each other.  i assume being that close they would be considered in each others air space.  we sat there and watched them for about 20 minutes and then they abruptly disappeared.  they did not fly away or dim, they literally just disappeared.  my husband took video from inside the house which did not come out good, likely due to the window glare.  shortly after they disappeared (about 10 minutes), another appeared by itself.  i took video of this one from our deck.  it is not good quality, you can only tell that it is a bright light, but you can plainly see that it is not moving, just hovering.  we're not totally sure what we saw, but these were definitely not planes.  very curious to know if anyone else in the area saw this as well.  we live

night, after sunset, quite dark.  i was with three friends, no alcohol or anything similar was involved.\r\n  \r\nwe noticed a football-shaped light (or, pair of lights), zooming silently and rapidly overhead.  it was as if a football had  a black band around its shorter circumference. on either side of this dark area were two lighted areas--- left of the band was red, the \"front\" part of the football shape was green.  these lighted areas are what gave the object its \"football\" shape-- picture a football, with a black band painted around its shorter circumference.  then picture the left hand part of the football illuminated red, and the area to the right side of the black band (the \"front\" part) illuminated green.  then picture this in a black sky.  all you could see were the two lighted areas, but they seemed to be part of one object.\r\n\r\nit zoomed into sight and suddenly stopped, it seemed, very close to us, let's say, several hundred feet above the ground.  after a

it was totally silent-- no motor noises.  \r\n\r\ni had never experienced anything like it before, and never have again.  i've been curious, after all these years, if anyone else reported seeing this
