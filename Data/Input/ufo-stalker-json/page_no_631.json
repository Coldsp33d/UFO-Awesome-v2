today (sept 23/15). it was roughly 12noon. i was looking at the sky out the windshield when i saw a commercial aircraft that looked to be at full altitude leaving a short dbl contrail behind it heading from an easterly direction  to the west. just behind the commercial craft was a smaller object appearing sphere like also leaving a contrail much shorter, a single trail and much thinner than the commercial craft. at first the object was roughly 3-4 of the commercial craft length behind and to the right of the contrail. it seemed to slow allowing the gap to become larger (6-8 commercial craft lengths),although it maintained the same flight path. i got out of my vehicle and continued to watch. it almost looked as if it had momentarily stopped. suddenly it sped up and shot forward toward the plane back to 3-4 commercial craft lengths and it darted from the right side on the contrail through it and to the left side seemingly sideways to get there so quickly . the object became much brighter several times during the sighting - perhaps sun glare?\r\ni looked down for a fraction of a second and then back but it was gone. the commercial aircraft continued on its course but the object had completely vanished. not even a trace of contrail from it. sighting lasted roughly 4 minutes i believe. i was a little stunned to be honest.  was it a jet fighter or a chaser jet? i wondered if that could be it so i did a little reading upon my return home. from that reading i learned that safety regulations prevent chaser jets from flying too close to larger aircraft or flying directly in its emissions wake.....So what was it?\r\nthank you for your time.\r\nsherri collins\r\np.S. i do not own a cell phone i would have taken a million pictures!\r\nthere may have been other witnesses that saw it because i was standing in the parking lot looking up to the sky at it.","distance":"Over One

it looked like many stars that we were gazing at and then we started to notice them moving around almost like a school of fish at times, blinking, or buzzing around. at first it seemed like one or two ufos but it was almost like they new we were looking and they started to reveal theirselves more and more. lately we have been seeing more dramatic events. like brighter closer ufos and or colorful blinking ufos. most of the time they hover and then erratically buzz around in the sky then hover some more and so forth. early this morning we decided to record it. we focused in a bright red star-like ufo. once we started recording it, it started moving around and changing from one color to the next of the rainbow. but what was more amazing is that the camera was picking up on many smaller blue lights or ufos flying allover the surrounding area of the colorful ufo that our naked eye was not seeing. i recorded a couple other videos of a disc like ufo over last few days that was extremely bright and moving rapidly in one place. like an energy force was helping it hover and move in one area. but the energy force was moving very rapidly. i will post both videos. it never really stopped we just stopped recording after a while. although we do notice after the sun rises we no longer see anything. after seeing this ufo activity and doing much research. i don't know what to think or if i should worry. it's as if they know we are watching them. and i wonder why they would they want us to see them and why it seems to get more and more revealing as time goes on. i somewhat am afraid of not knowing what alien race it is or why they are there. and the safety of the human race and our planet concerns me. so to give myself some type of comfort i decided to give the information we have seen to mufon.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

similar craft. as far as i know its the only one of this type of craft reported anyway this is what happened.\r\nabout 20 years ago myself wife and two children are driving home from a friends place in vancouver b.C. to our home in surrey b.C. a 30 min. drive. the route we took takes us right passed yvr our international airport as we drove passed we seen two planes land and that was it we were passed the airport. around 2 minutes later my wife who was driving the car southbound say's what the hell are these bright lights they are blinding me i cant see the road. i said it must be a plane landing but we were way past the airport just slow down and don't look at them and we will be ok, she is panicking saying she cant see anything. so i was in the passenger seat and i rolled down my window as fast as i could stuck my head way out the window and got a perfect view of this thing. it no longer had the bright lights on, there was also no navigation or beacon lights of any kind nor was there any sound or signs of propulsion. it was about 300 ft. off the ground and traveling approx.50 mph allot slower than the last 2 planes we just seen land. now comes the real strange part the bottom of this craft looked like it had 20ft by 10ft sheets of very thick black steel which were attached together by at least 2-4ft.Massive welds i have never seen anything with welds that big. i wanted to get some idea of the overall size of this thing but it fit so well into the dark sky it made it hard to see at all never mind judge the overall size. as it past over and you could sort of make out the back edge it was just as nuts it looked like it was just these super thick sheets of steel floating along. i asked my wife to stop the car so i could get a better look at it she replied with no f'n way in the world can you make me stop this car.\r\nso i started to think what could this possibly be maybe there were heavy lift choppers but i would have noticed them for sure. i am a certified aerospace machinist by trade over the years built subs for the australian military, helicopters, planes for boeing and cessna. needless to say i know a man made air craft when i see one. the one we seen that night was possibly man made but not with human technology this thing looked evil it was not built for a pleasure cruise. i hate to admit it but it scared me also no matter who built it. \r\nwe were so freaked out i even phoned the airport to see if something big or military came in.\r\nthe tower said nothing and gave a little giggle typical.\r\n\r\nthe reason i contacted you is i was wondering i you have had any other similar version to mine","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

of new york city in a highly populated area at around 7:11pm. my niece noticed the object while playing on a slide in the yard outside. she informed us all and i along with my father, mother, wife, 2 nieces and my 3 very small children watched it glide over us in a straight path across the sky. it was fairly low, silent, and reflected light or had some lights on it (not quite sure). at first i thought it was a balloon or drone which still may be the case although it doesn't look like any drone i've seen on the internet. the object seem to have appendages somewhat and the company i was with joked about it looking like a man in a jet pack. so it seemed to have blinking lights or may have been reflecting sunlight off of a metallic like surface. my father who has a somewhat professional nikon camera ran in the house to grab his camera and take photos. he was able to zoom in and snap a few photos with his camera as i recorded video of the object from my iphone. it acted somewhat like a balloon floating by since it never really slowed down, changed direction or speed, or strayed from its path.The bbq location was approximately 100-150 ft from interstate 95. the object seemed to travel in the southbound direction of the interstate and seemed to be directly above it. i started to think it was a drone at that point, possibly trying to get an arial perspective of the highway. we were all excited at the thought of it being a ufo/drone because being a new yorker, we have never really seen anything like that before. it was also a little disturbing to think maybe it was a drone recording is from above, just kinda creepy i guess. so i studied the video i have on my phone for a few minutes after the sighting and pondered what the object could be. i was pretty much settled on the thought of it being a drone until my father showed me the zoomed up image that he had taken in his camera (nikon) which is unidentifiable to me as a drone. i took a snapshot of his computer screen after he uploaded his camera pics to his computer. so the video i will post is from my iphone and the pixelated pic is from my fathers computer. he has the original pic which i'm sure is better quality to whomever may need it. settled on the thought of it being a drone at the time of recording, i gave up before it passed out of sight over the neighbors houses down the street. several minutes later i saw maybe 20-30 large white (weather balloon like ) balloons float past in the aky in similar direction.  they looked nothing like the first object we spotted. they seemed to be at a higher altitude and very spread apart. they were white and much harder to see and disappeared just the same in a similar direction but not exact direction of the first object.

sequim, wa.(48.8701, -123.16204) it was a clear night, and i was enjoying looking at the bright stars, driving on a rural road, when i spotted an orange star. i thought it was kinda neat, and i had never seen an orange star before. as i pulled up to the stop sign i got out looked at it for a couple minutes. there were other stars in the vicinity, but they were white, so it wasn't orange due to smoke or clouds. it looked like a star, but then i saw it seemed closer, like within lower earth orbit, since it was five to ten times larger than other stars in the sky. it did not blink or wink, like with atmospheric interference. it did not have any navigational lights on, nor wobble like a helicopter (which i saw later in the evening). compared to the helicopter, it was bigger, stable, silent, glowing and orange (not small, moving, noisy, blinking red, white, and green). when i used reference points, i felt it was not as far as the hill 2-4 miles to the south,southwest (ssw) of me. it seemed it was just hovering over the subdivision area around olson road and cassidy creek or aldercreek roads. i tried to take some photos, but it was too dim to be recorded. as a car was coming, i got in my car and drove. almost immediately i could not see it, as it was above me, and blanked out by my roof (i did not think to open the sun roof). i continued south and west via mill road to highway 101, which was about a half mile away. after 3ish minutes, i stopped at a gas station at the intersection and gassed up, but could not see it anymore. don't know if it moved, blinked out, or was drowned out by light pollution of the gas station. posting this record, in case someone else saw it, and can plot some kind of movement. it did not seem like a natural phenomenon. what are these orbs made of? they just seem as uniform light, not shadowed by any form.","distance":"Over One

and it blinked once before completely disappearing. \r\n\r\nonce i arrived onto route 100 i saw something that may have been a flair, but i'm not completely sure. there were no planes in the area, nor a military base for twenty or so miles out. it looked like a first a hovering bright white/purple dot. it started to fall, then rise back up, zigzag crazily whilst blinking so there was no constant light as it moved. if it were a flare, i'm not sure how it moved back up the sky, but it was very odd. a plane started to come into view and it completely disappeared. \r\n\r\nthere are many military bases in the area, bwi airport, and we are in the flight zone for if the president is evacuated to camp david, we would see their planes/helicopters when used. it was an extremely odd night seeing so many ufo's, but with supposed upcoming events, it seemed very off but not at the same time.
