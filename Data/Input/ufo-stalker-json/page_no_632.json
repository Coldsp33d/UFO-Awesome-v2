in the morning, i was changing the oil on a air compressor.  i am not sure why to this day, but it was as if something had wanted me to turn around and lookup to see its' presence.  i went leaning over the air compressor, and turned to my right.  i saw what could only to be explained as the brightest, and most brilliant white light i've ever seen in the sky.  it was coming over the tree-line atop the mountains.  the evening was clear, no clouds, and the stars were quite visible.  the object was brilliant and quite large in size, the distance from my view point would have been a mile or so based on the distance of the mountains it came over.  the light i had seen would be moving towards me from the west to the north.  it would be moving, and while moving it would become brighter, extremely bright and then dim out quickly.  only to be dim for approximately three seconds, and then illuminate back to its' original brightness.  then it would repeat the same pattern as before, bright then extremely bright, and then dim out completely. this happened approximately four to six times.  the last time it was it's original brightness, and then changed direction abruptly and shooting straight up and disappearing at a phenomenal speed. i had not seen the object again.  i have a witness, who was my boss at that time.  he had come around the corner after the first time i had noticed the light.  i pointed it out to him, we both watched as it went through the transformations the four to six times and then disappeared. i have spoken to him about this since it had happened, and he does not like talking about it.  i have come forth, only because this is the second time i have seen nearly the identical object, and same pattern of being brilliant white, then becoming extremely bright and dimming out only to be a further distance away before illuminating again.  there were no f.A.A. lights on this object, no other aircraft in the vicinity, and no sounds were emitted from this object. the other time i had seen almost identically the same incident, was in north pitcher, ny approximately 8 months ago while sitting on my friends back deck of his house.  i could sketch out the scenario, as i draw/paint quite a bit.  giving approximations on flight patterns, size during original illumination, and size when it had become more brilliant before disappearing several times crossing half the horizon in distance within 40-45 seconds.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

when i looked up and saw an object far, far away and climbing up in the sky.  i thought that had to be the rocket taking off so i told my friend and we both started waving to it like kids do, just having fun and laughing when the objects seemed to see us and the little bit of light got bigger and bigger as it came across the sky from high up to hovering right in front of us.  the next thing i remember is telling my friend that one of us should run in and tell my parents.  we argued in front of it for a few minutes then i lost the fight, turned around to run and told her to watch the thing and not to let it go anywhere until i got back with my parents.  later she said that as soon as i began to run back to the house, the thing took off straight up in the air and disappeared.  the next

when i observed a light in the sky.At first i thought it was a satalite untill it stopped dead in its path ,then changed direction and came to hover ten to fifty miles away in  the sky.(hard to tell how far away exactly ) i then went to get my binoculars to get a better look.Came back outside and looked thru binoculars there was a triangle craft with red green and whites lights flashing in no particular pattern. i continued to c these craft over the next three or four days. i then showed my mother and she was frightened by it so i left that alone. i then informed a friend of mine and he came to my rural home to observe with me as they where coming every night and he was as intrested as me.That night therre were four craft in the sky we watched them zip around almost like they are swimming around the night sky for two or three hours.They were acending and decending moving around in many different directions and patterns throughout that time.We grew weary of watching after a few hours and were about to go inside when we seen a light coming from the northeast we bthen noticed it was being follwed the craft quickly dissapeared but the jet following it was quite close so i shined my flashlight at it then shone my beam strait in the sky.At this point the jet that had been following the craft came strait at us it flew rite over my house just above the trees..I then had no doubt it was a military fighter plane which i have never seen in this area in my life.The next day there was a newscast on ctv winnipeg talking about the strange lights in the sky over northwestern ontario.They claimed they were testing search and rescue probes out of shilo military base in manitoba.(i live very near the manitoba ontario border) but i do not beleive these were any craft that we have in our military or at least nothing the public has ever heard of..These craft manuvere so quickly and change direction instantly without slowing at all.When the leave they dissapear across the sky instantly.These craft continue to be seen on most clear nights,they were never here before .I have ben interested in ufology for a long time so i watch the skies constantly and these are a new phenomena for me .If your organization had anyone in my area im sure someone with high definition cameras and telescopes or something like that could come and get close up photographic evidence as they seem to sit in the sky at a distance on most nights for the last three weeks or so. i also know of another man who has been seeing orbs thru this same time period.He claims they are coming within ten to twenty feet of him on a regular basis ,he has taken some photographs of them as well. we would appreciate any feedback from youyr organization on these sightimgs. tthere have been to many sightings for me to type them all out.Ive observed them so many times it dosent even surprise me anymore when i look into the night sky and see them there. i just expect them to be there now.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

fireworks display finished on nat'l mall.  i could hear them, but they were not visible. shortly after when people had left the site, i saw a medium low altitude reddish/orange single light flying toward me from the direction of the westerly portion of the fireworks site. having seen this type of object two previous times, and also videotaped, i immediately recognized it, and was able to agioan use my videocam to capture it's transit and behavior. \r\n\r\n   this object is shaped similar to a cocktail olive on end, or an egg shaped with the narrow tip at the bottom. set into the base but fully mobile is a brilliant white light sphere which constantly moves around in a moving eye type of movement. the craft in which it's set also has the ability to tilt freely, with the ability to tilt to a full 90 degrees. this allows the sphere in the base to have great range of ...Whatever it's doing. i certainly do not know if it's beaming or receiving or both.  the most striking aspect is that none of these movement affect the smoothness of the flight line.   \r\n\r\nas it drew closer, i realized it would come into close visual range of my projecting light into my big mirrored ball in my back yard. i use a decollimated laser with wide beam to illuminate it, and it's awesome. i stopped taping and quickly moved to the side front corner and projected into the mirrored ball, the result was the craft slowed and then made an instant 100 degree turn from north direction to west.  i then used my laser to make a quick pair of star shapes in the trees where it could be seen. i then resumed taping. the craft had slowed considerably, but as it moved to the west it turned its light down and then fully off. \r\n\r\nthere were no nav lights indicating any terrestrially law-abiding craft. there was zero noise as usual. the light in the base was a thousand times too bright to have been some kind of candle or flame heat source to levitate some kind of lantern.  the estimated diameter is uniform for the 3 separate sightings i have had of these is about that of a school bus or even a metrobus.   on the 1st two sightings, there were three in a line, and each time the marines presidential helicopter unit's regular patrolling huey came into the area within a minute or two, plainly looking for them. on this 4th of july event. there was only one and no copter investigated. i mention this as there was a hyped terror threat for this 4th, but even with this substantial craft at low altitude flying up from the mass gathering on the mall no one cared. \r\n\r\nmy impression after seeing other ufo types in these skies is that they seem extremely advanced, and in fact close frames seem to indicate some kind of possibly genetically engineered hull as it glows from the

satellites.  at 5:20 a.M., thur., 17 sep 2015, i was watching for satellites and noticed two (2) bright lights which i thought were bright stars and even muttered to myself, \"where'd you two guys come from\"?\r\n\r\ni observed two (2) very bright \"stars\" which after staring at them for a few seconds, realized that they were moving through the sky.  i observed these two (2) lights for a total of 20 to 30 seconds.  as they got to approximately 80 degrees from the horizon, they instantly \"shut off\".  i continued to watch because given their flight path, in another 5 seconds or so, they would have been directly overhead.\r\n\r\nafter waiting 2 to 3 minutes and not seeing them again, i ran and got my i-phone to take a compass reading which revealed that they were approximately 319-320 degrees nw (from my location using north as the reference point).\r\n\r\nabsolutely no sound and as stated, they instantly turned off as though someone had thrown a light switch.  the only thing i had was my zippo lighter and the distance between the two objects was approximately the width of my zippo lighter held out at arms length (approximately 24\" outstretched arm).\r\n\r\nconditions were: crystal clear night and still total darkness at that time of the morning (0520 hours).  there were absolutely no clouds in the sky.  i am 100% assured that i was not witnessing a jetliner nor any other type of recognized aircraft as again, these objects had the  brightness of the brightest stars in the sky.\r\n\r\nplease note that the two (2) lights were 'one-behind-the-other\" and as i held up my zippo lighter as a reference of the distance between the two (2) objects (sideways, at arms length), they stayed in perfect alignment during my entire observation.  unfortunately, i was unable to ascertain their height/distance away from me.  additionally, i could not tell if the objects was a single object with lights at the front or back, but based on my 20 to 30 seconds of viewing, they again maintained perfect alignment, i.E. one-behind-the-other.\r\n\r\nmy feelings immediately after viewing these two objects was one of \"i know what i saw, but i don't know what i saw\" - unfortunately, i don't know how else to better explain it than that.  but i know that what i saw was again, not a normally recognized aircraft as my feelings are that the objects had to have been very large and at a great distance.  thank you for the opportunity to report this!
