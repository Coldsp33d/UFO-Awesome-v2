turned onto my road and had only about 5 minutes till we were at my house. it was about 1:30 am. i was driving down my road like i always do when all of a sudden something to the east caught my attention. to the east of the road there is a field that goes for about a mile then ends and turns into a long tree line. above the tree line there was two orange lights hovering in the sky. they were bright lights, but also had a dimness to them. both objects were disc shaped and about the same size. they were hovering about 20-30 feet above the tree line and about 10 feet apart from each other. also they were exactly diagonal to each other. once i noticed them i immediatly stopped my car and started asking my boyfriend if he noticed them. he did, so we decided to sit there and see what they did. for a couple minutes they were just hovering in the same spot, never moving. then the two discs started moving closer to each other. it was all of a sudden like they just fused together. it went from being two disc like orange objects to being one big disc like orange object, almost like they connected together. at this point me and my boyfriend were extremely fascinated. i knew i had to get it on camera or tell someone what i was seeing. i decided to call my friend who's house we had just left. i was parked in the middle of the road, so i figured before i did all this i would pull my car over and turn my headlights off, so i did. after i pulled the car over and turned all the lights off i went to call my friend. this is when things started to get really really weird for us. my call started to go through, i heard one ring, and part of another ring, then my phone started making noises i've never heard before, and never heard since. the only description i have for it was it was making like a fax machine type noise. a lot of ringing and buzzing. then my phone shut off. which i still can't figure out because i still had at least 50% of my battery left. i looked up at my boyfriend and started freaking out and telling him my phone died. he looked up at me and at first was just listening to me. i remember he was looking somewhat past me, i knew he was looking at the strange object. all of a sudden, and i remember it happened within a matter of seconds, my boyfriends eyes got huge and his facial expression went from curious to terrified. without even hesitation he started yelling at me to drive away. i turned to see what was causing such a reaction from him, and i remember just seeing it and having such a nightmarish feeling come over me. when i looked back the object was a lot closer than it had originally been, and it was heading right in our direction. when we were watching it before from my car when it was above the tree line it was about 2 miles from us. when i turned after my boyfriend started freaking out it was less than a mile from us. i remember it was coming so fast at us i almost didn't know what to do. i wanted to stay put and see what it did. but i remember this terrified feeling came over me. something was telling me it wasn't friendly and that i need to drive away. i felt a scary very non friendly presence from it. i quickly turned my car on and started speeding away. i remember my boyfriend saying \"it's coming, its right above us\" and yelling at my to go faster. at this point i was going 90 mph trying to desperately get away from it. but my boyfriend kept saying it was getting closer. i didn't wanna look at it because of how fast i was going but i knew i had to see what he was seeing. i pushed the brakes alittle bit to slow down and quickly turned my head to see what was going on. to this day, i still clear as day remember what i saw when i looked back and will never forget about it. when i turned around it was only about 30 feet from my car. it was about north east from my car. i remember seeing a large triangle. it had 3 whitish orange lights around the bottom and a big red light in the middle of the bottom. one odd thing  i noticed was the red light was shaped like an orb. i could see it shaped as a perfect circle, almost like it was floating in the bottom of the triangle. the rest of the triangle was really dark, almost black. but weirdly kind of transparent. i remember it was kind of like wobbling while it was hovering towards us. seeing that scared the life out of me, so i quickly turned back and speed faster away. but all of a sudden my boyfriend said it vanished. i turned again and he was right, it was just gone!! i stopped my car and looked all over the sky. we even got out of my car and looked all around to see if we seen it. but no there was nothing! we didn't know what to do so we just went home and never really talked about it much to anyone. whenever i try to tell people they always just say it was a plane or helicopter. but we know what we saw!

heard an airplane so looked up and saw a small passenger jet go over . that is when i noticed what i thought was maybe a chrome aircraft because it was shining very bright, so bright that i could not

trying to figure out what they were. as one of them was moving east going behind the trees i went to the front yard to get a  better angle. when i got to the front of the house the one moving east continued to disappear behind trees and the first one i saw stopped near the other two then slowly began to go east . so i looked around to see if anyone else was seeing this too , seeing nobody around i thought i need to get a picture of this. so i ran inside and grabbed my wife's phone and when i got back outside there were only two that i could see and when i tried to take a picture it was so bright outside that i couldn't see anything on the phone screen . that is when i heard talking behind me , hoping that someone else was seeing this i turned to look . i saw my neighbors looking the other way so i turned back to keep trying to get a picture but and in the two to three seconds it took me to look behind me and look back they were gone. i then spent the next half hour walking around

passed my driving test and so took every opportunity to drive around. at around 10pm on the night in question, we drove along a little dirt track which lead to a scrap yard. either side of the narrow potholed track was a drainage ditch and mature trees which formed a tree tunnel. it was quite dark at the time as there were very few street lights. we drove carefully along the track for approximately 300 to 400 meters. this was when we both noticed the object. it appeared to be at the top of the tree tunnel (approximately 20 to 30ft above the ground) and about 20ft ahead of us. as soon as we saw it, we stopped the car to look at it. it appeared the size of a small television (around 3ft x 3ft) but totally square. it was pure white light with perfect right angled corners. no light was reflected from it into anything at all. we watched for approx 30 seconds when it suddenly disappeared. to describe how, i would say like an old fashioned television being turned off where the light disappears from the outside first and eventually leaves just a small white dot in the middle before disappearing altogether. when this happened, my friend and i just looked at each other as if to ask if we both really saw what just happened. hardly more than 2 to 3 seconds later, the white square reappeared directly in front of my car (about 5ft in front of it) with the bottom edge where i would imagine e the ground to be. basically what i'm saying is it was at ground level. but this time it was 20 to 30ft square. we both screamed in what i guess was fear and i immediately put the car into reverse and retreated back along the track as fast as i dared (which wasn't very fast as i feared that the car may go off the track and end up in a drainage ditch). we left the scene and returned at around 9am the following morning to see if there was any rational explanation. we found absolutely nothing to suggest any rational explanation. \r\ni have reported this once before around 8 year ago to yahoo answers but all i received in return were questions about what drugs i was taking at the time which i found quite insulting. i was 18 years old, never drank alcohol and never touched any drugs of any kind and neither did my friend.","distance":"20 Feet or

feet across and about 10 feet tall. it then was about a half of a mile away from me over se when it stopped for a second then started making left and right movements. it swung left to right then left again pretty quickly kind of like it was on a pendulum. i started to question whether was a drone or something like an aircraft at this point. i wanted to take my phone out to shoot a video but my supervisor was somewhere nearby and we aren't allowed to use our personal phones. it made the quick maneuvers left to right about 5 times then all if a sudden it stopped moving then simply vanished! i got chills down my back just then because i realized that it definitely wasn't a drone or something manmade. it completely dissapeared. i had a very clear view of it when it dissapeared and i can't

shock, we didn't know what we saw, and felt whatever it was it wasn't powered by jet fuel, since there was no noise at all","distance":"21-100

to see the stars.  i noticed some very bright stars and then that they were the wrong color, amber, and were moving.  they were approaching in a string from the west.  they did not blink like a plane, were round, glowing, and silent.  i grabbed my phone and tried to video them but my hand was shaking so much i was afraid it would be poor quality. (it was).  i ran into the house and yelled to my wife that there was a flock of ufo passing overhead.  i have never seen them before and never been a ufo buff so my wife took notice.  she quickly got up and came outside with me.  we stood on our balcony and watched them file overhead, one by one, eight to a dozen or more, like beads on a string, silent, glowing balls, one after the other.  they seemed to waver a little side to side like they are following each other.  as they started to move off approximately east by north east, we heard a plane sound approaching from the south and a plane came into view, wing tip lights visible, belly light flashing, unknown model of craft, but flying in the direction of providence, ri or maybe following the balls of light.  i cannot be certain it saw them or not, but it appeared to be at their height.  i would estimate over 3,000 feet, but far less than say, 20,000 feet, not aircraft cruising altitude.  the balls appeared to be at that level. we have discussed what we saw with our neighbor, the local police commissioner who also has an aircraft business, and have not found any rational explanation.  i have found a still photograph on-line from 2 hours earlier that night over michigan which is much better quality than mine and is absolutely identical to what i saw that night except i saw many of them.  oddly enough what i saw came from that direction. i apologize if this is a duplicate, but i have filled out many such descriptions in the hope of finding someone who has an explanation and i have yet to find anyone who does.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
