i regularly go watching for shooting stars at night so i've seen my fair share, and even the biggest ones i've seen didn't compare to this. it was bigger around, much faster, and fell at an angle i don't see stars fall at. i ask my friend if he saw it, he says no, i describe it to him, and he says maybe it was a crashing plane or something. we both agree it couldnt be. we stay there watching the sky for about another hour to see if we can find anything else before giving up and moving on to meet up with some other friends. i get a little excited and tell a bunch of my friends about it, sending them a picture of the evening sky taken minutes after i saw the flash. sadly i no longer have that photo, though i have no idea if it could've done any good. i feel confusion and excitement are pretty reasonable things to experience and don't think my mental state was affected much, if at all, by this. if anything, it gave me an odd sense of calm but i was already feeling pretty relaxed so i couldn't blame it all on that.  \r\n\r\ni have waited almost a month to make this report because a) i've been trying to figure out exactly what it was i saw and b) i wasn't sure if it was a big enough deal to make a report on. i figure it couldn't hurt though. and i can't think of anything reasonable that this flash could have been. regardless of what this streak actually is it isn't something normal, it isn't something that i have ever seen before, not something anyone i know has seen before.  it's weird and i can't explain it. thank you for your time and i hope this helps you out somehow.

the park's main valley.  i woke needing to answer nature's call and checked my watch:  5:00. as i exited the tent, i heard a voice in my head--a voice mine yet not mine, as if synthesized far away and 'made' mime.  it said, sounding each syllable, \"you might see something strange out there.\" i walked several yards and squatted in the sand.  as i looked up, i saw the sky was still pitch black and strewn with stars.  a large golden ball of light was coming toward my area from the east where lake mead is.  it was 2 miles away, even with the visitor center, moving east.  it glowed but emitted no rays; no sound; no variation in speed or heigth.  the closer it came, within 1/2-mile of me or less, the more astonishing and beautiful it seemed.  at that point i again heard that voice in my mind, just 2 words, again deliberately sounding each syllable:  \"spiritual intelligence\".  it made a smooth 90-degree turn to the north and disappeared behind the cliffs closest to the campground, perhaps 1/2-mile or less distant.  the cliffs are about 250-ft. high, which is how i guaged it's elevation.  it was lower than the cliff.  i knew it would come to a box canyon very quickly if it did not change its trajectory.  i waited perhaps 10 mins for the sound of a crash or its reappearance, buy neither happened.\r\n\r\nthe psychological effects were profound.  i felt blessed, and very disturbed.  no one was interested.  i felt isolated. perhaps the most profound experience of my life and no one to share it with.  i constantly thought about and replayed the globe of light.  i wondered if my mind concocted the \"spiritual intelligence\" as a way of coping with my observation.  even so, i couldn't explain hearing the warning on exiting mt tent that fateful day.\r\n\r\ni told my father, a career air force pilot who was also instrumental in then-classified programs and working with the cia on aerial surveilance imaging systems.  he ascribed what i saw to a weather balloon, or the effect of the  sunrise soon to .Come above the horizon.  i started reading ufo books, especially about orbs in yakima valley, wa.  i'd been an earth sciences student, so i could buy a theory about orbs above the also very fault-ridden valley of fire.  but the yakima orbs were small and moved erraticalaly, unlike what i saw.  i came to learn the valley of fire is a ufo .Hot spot.  earlier than my 1991 sighting, i'd watched what i assumed was a satellite until it stopped suddenly and reversed its path against the stars.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

even though i could see it was twinkling with my naked eye. i went in the house & grabbed 2 different pairs of binoculars & my samsung galaxy cell phone with an 8mp camera. i observed thru binoculars a disc shaped object, covered in red/ green pulsating lights. the object was mostly stationary, with an occasional side to side movement. the object(s)appeared to also divide into 2 & then merge back together. one of the divided parts looked like a ring that had pulsating red/ green lights rotating in a counter- clockwise spin. i used my cell to take several still photos, as best i could. i don't know what it was but i know it wasn't an airplane. planes aren't stationary & don't move from side to side, or divide into two. i don't think it was a helicopter, because they only have a couple

feel the light hitting my eye and then there this white sphere or light is in the sky just floating across the sky. i wear glasses and i am not wearing them at the time but i can tell i never seen anything like this before. about 2 minutes go by when i decide to take a picture. first picture nothing so i take another. got it! not the best pictures but i actually have it in both photos. pictures were taken with my cell phone. no matter what i saw i have a picture this time to prove im not crazy. so with that out of my system lets move onto some more facts about that day.\r\n     i have lived in cleveland ohio my entire life and hopkins air port is a part of my life. i see planes all the time in the sky and hear them also. this day was so nice because clear blue sky's and no planes, at all. i didn't see one plane all day. i don't know what i saw, but i feel like i really saw something special. i made a video a couple hours after taking photos to show the quit cleveland sky and give

value to you.  we are located in central ohio.\r\n\r\nsept. 10th of this year, the sky was mostly cloudy w/a few breaks.  shortly after sunset, i was certain i spotted something that looked like a very slow moving triangle ufo at an est. ¼ - ½ mile straight overhead.  it quickly, was hidden by clouds.\r\n\r\nsept.12th, at 9:15p est, i clearly spotted an identical triangle at an est. ¼ mile directly overhead.  two red lights, and one white headlight.  my wife and i watched this craft make impossible 90° and 45° maneuvers, in very short distances, directly overhead.  several minutes later, a 2nd identical craft joined this one, and the first craft existed the area.  10 – 15 minutes later, an incredibly bright and very low light appeared from the north.  it was moving very slow and i thought it was a jet on approach.  big mistake.  minutes later, our power was shut down for about 10 seconds, and i totally missed seeing the craft, which, most likely was right overhead, again.\r\n\r\nsept. 12th, 10:05p est, i observed the same bright light approaching from the north, and again, i had no camera with me.  i boldly stood as the craft centered directly between my eyes and came overhead at an est. 15 – 20 mph.  it presented what appeared to be a full display of lights, including a ring of brilliant red individual lights, dead center in the belly of the craft.  it was lit like ‘times square’ and utterly silent.  again, a triangle.  this time, left light red and right, green.  the head-beam was brighter than the moon, cast for a couple miles forward, at least, and came over at an est. 125’.  they allowed me to see the entire craft.  i was in awe! and … i wasn’t the least bit frightened.  i think the light mesmerized me.  if it were any lower, i could have hit it with a rock.  as it was about to exit our property, the only sound it made was a low crackling sound.  the back edge was trimmed with yellow oblong ports.  i got a great look at the craft, but missed a sensational photo op!  this struck me as an anti-gravity mode, as the giant craft barely moved through the air, with no wind being generated.\r\n\r\nnext couple days, i spotted a couple high altitude triangles, but nothing that i could photograph.\r\n\r\nsept. 18th, another triangle came over just before 11p est moving at an est. 200 mph and only displayed the three lights; white, red, and green.  i literally had just taken my cam in 3 minutes earlier to protect it from condensation.  it was at an est. 1000 feet.  sounded like a jet.\r\n\r\nsept. 19th, i got it on video!  moving at an est. 200 mph and only displaying the same light configuration.  the video is hand-held (sorry for the jerkiness), but you pros should be able to view it frame by frame.  we lost power again this night at an est. 4:30a and just before 11a (sunday).\r\n\r\nwe have had a history over the past 10 months of very peculiar power surges and ringing phones, simultaneously.  i have every reason to believe it is some form of an emp or emf, at least, that is being directed at our home, from these crafts.\r\n\r\nas you are all aware of the aurora project, the aurora does not move at 45° or 90° angles, nor can it fly at 20 mph and stay in the air.  i have every reason to believe these are all alien space crafts.  if you will, imagine the $100s of billions one aurora would cost to build … and … then … there are 2 of them over my property at once?!  i don’t think so.  these triangles are being seeing all over the globe, hence, there is no way the us govt. could afford to build and operate 100s or 1000s of these incredible machines.  i have to believe, something bigger is going on here.\r\n\r\nrespectfully,\r\nskyhawk\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

a cigarette and just as i lit it i saw it. it resembled a radio controlled helicopter but a helicopter that flipped and tumbled on every axis.Shifted \r\ndirection instantly moving left to  right, each horizontal motion covered around 200-400 feet a second before changing direction. it did this for around 4 minutes, i can best describe it as hinged in the center like a pair of scissors  and moved like how a butterfly knife looks when twirling it around. it disappeared into a cloud and as it it stopped spinning and slowly ascended into clouds. ive seen unexplained lights and strange

but it was way to big and went completely across the sky (at around 10:35), i thought ok probably a satalight or something, so we went outside again and at around 10:40 we seen another one going in the same path, i was blown away, and concerned, i wasn't really a believer in that kind of stuff, i had seen just orange glowing or flaming something and appeared to be the shape of like a fighter jet, but was completely beaming orange, with a glow, i thought maybe a metor, that wouldn't explain the the size or shape or the same path the first one took, it was at least 100 time the size of a star, then i thought what if it is a missel but it was much to big, it just reminded me in the movies of what they look like going through the sky, but that would explain the 2 in a row, i also thought it may be government testing thing, it was way to fast for a satilight, then i thought maybe a unknown space or air craft, what ever it was it was fast, it went across our sky with in about 45 sec, and it was huge, but made no sound and there was no trail.  i was just praying it was not something harmful, nothing was on the news in the morning, i was just hoping for some explanation to what it was.  my husband loves looking at the stars at night, that is how he 1st noticed it.  we tried to see if another one was going to come but the sky started to cloud over after about 10 min, and the

high (like they were about to land on one of the airports).\r\n\r\ndefinitely it was an experience we will never forget. i tried to film the first one with my cellphone, but i was so perplex with the

the eastern sky, towards a well known plane manufacture co. i saw a very brite light (directly above this plane manufacturing co.) that did not move, and up a little higher and more south east, there was another brite light, slowly moving upwards. at first i thought it was stars, since it was still a lil dark outside, but the sky was clear, except just below the \r\n\"first brite light,\"  was a \"chem trail\" or should i say exhaust trail from a previous plane.\r\nso i asked my boyfriend to come an check this out. he took a look at both brite lights, got frightened an ran back inside. i then grabbed my tablet, and \r\nvideo taped what i had seen. when i zoomed on the light, it was illuminating, throwing off different colors. my boyfriend described it as looking as if the light\r\nwas vibrating.\r\nfor some reason i could not film the second light on my video, while the first light did not move, the second one was climbing upwards.\r\ni had to go inside to get ready for work, when we left around 6:50, both lights were gone.\r\nlater that day i told my father about it, he said he seen the same \"first brite light\" that i had, he also says he does not known what it
