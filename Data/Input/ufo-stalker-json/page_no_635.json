is not allowed in my apartment) he called me out to see what he called \"an annunaki space ship\" so i came out to the balcony just in time to see a star like object moving in a southbound direction suddenly stop moving and start hovering.\r\n\r\ni told my friend i needed to get my glasses so  that i could better see the object. so i returned to my living room to collect my eyeglasses. when i returned to the balcony wearing my glasses the object had disappeared into the clouds. when i asked my friend where it had gone he replied that it had ascended vertically.\r\n\r\nthis sighting was not identifiable in my opinion but was identified by my friend to be an annunaki vehicle. my friend has been promising me that he has been visiting with the annunaki and travelling to their home world many times since he was eleven years old.\r\n\r\npsychiatrists have declared this man's ramblings to be delusional because this person has a mental illness. however, the same person has referred me to two other persons who are connected with an annunaki star people's landing site in the province of quebec, canaada.\r\n\r\ni was not surprised to see a moving light in the sky because this was  not the first time i have witnessed moving star-like objects in the nightime.\r\n\r\ni will prepare a more complete report of all the times i have witnessed what might be called ufos.\r\n\r\none of the other persons revealed to me by this friend has a website on which he describes a long standing history of annunaki visitors at the quebec landing site.\r\n\r\nmy friend has answered many questions about the star people. he declares that there are three different types of alien visitors; namely: the greys, the annunaki, and the reptilian. he also claims that the annunaki are the most advanced and are willing to share technology in return for certain natural and supernatural resources.\r\n\r\nthe person who has posted the website has publicly declared that his name and the website are accessible to anyone free from monetary charges or any other obligations.\r\n\r\ni am a systems design engineer who has embarked up[on a quest to build a factory to mass manufacture a fleet of faster than light speed space craft that will be used as disaster relief transportation on both of our planets.\r\n\r\nmy friend has recently backed up my preliminary design work on this project. due to a lack of finances, i have had to stop working on the project because the software i need costs money and i am living on a fixed income without any success in my efforts to raise any working capital.\r\n\r\nmy friend and i have watched the mufon hangar 1 show many times. he has declared the triangular ships to be annunaki war vessels. a psychiatrist has convinced authorities to issue an order against my having any further contact with this co-witness. but i do have permission to visit the annunaki landing site with the person who has posted the website.\r\n\r\ni have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, however, i do not think this fact diminishes the quality of my reporting my experiences. my understanding of the true nature of my illness and my success in augmenting the minimal drug therapy prescribed by the doctors allows me to have a cohesive command of the english language, and the ability to be accurate in the details of my report.\r\n\r\ni have a self generated internet presence as well and i am fearless to go public with my experiences relating to all my knowledge about the  lights that appear to be moving in the sky, and about my scientific contributions to high technology.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

sky. i was siting on my porch facing north west, and a red orb\r\nappeared out of nowhere and moved across the sky then stopped and hovered. it almost seemed like it had been sitting there and someone decided to turn on the lights! it hovered or sat in the same spot \r\nfor around 30 seconds, after which time it blinked out again. i ran in the house and called my husband to get the camera and take video.\r\nwhen i returned outside to see if i could view it again, there appeared what looked like plane lights, at least three of them, flying\r\nin and around the area where the red orb appeared.\r\n several minutes later, my son and grand daughter came driving up for a visit and i had just told them all what i had witnessed, when\r\nthe light show began again! the red orb appeared again in the same general area, but this time to the left of where it first appeared.\r\nit again hovered in the air with the same plane type smaller lights flashing blue, red, and white around it. my husband was trying to \r\nfilm it but the camera battery was dead. the orb again disappeared but the smaller lights stayed flying around the area. the larger\r\norb appeared once again, this time to the right of it's original first sighting. my husband witnessed it twice and son witnessed it three times. i witnessed it four.\r\n we have watched the news for any kind of answer to this sighting, but nothing. no comets', no explosions, zip! i didn't know who to \r\ncontact, so googled lights in the sky over central part of the state, and came upon this sight. my son was completely mind boggled and upset, and didn't want to speak of it with me,\r\nbut i am willing to talk with someone if needed. i've never in my life seen anything such as this and felt excitement and wonder to witness it!\r\n in conclusion, the large red orb would changed colors at times, with blue, green, and red, but mainly a orange/red color predominating.\r\nthe smaller lights looked as if they might be aircraft as they were much slower moving than the orb. they did however continuously\r\ncircle the area where the orb appeared, each time, in each distinct area. the whole experience lasted at least 20 minutes. again, the \r\norb would blink on, stay on for several seconds, move a small amount in a given direction and then blink off, only to reappear in\r\na different section of the same general area, and blink out again. this is a clear night with no clouds and all the stars shining. the moon was out as well. we lost sight of the orb as it blinked off again and didn't show back up for at least 10 minutes more that we stood there watching.Also,\r\nthe smaller plane type lights continue to fly around as i write this message.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

it was very small, like a faint star. however, this in the afternoon just before 2:00pm. there were no clouds in the sky. the object seemed to be in the direction of santa monica, roughly to the north-west. it was very hard to discern, and if you looked away it was hard to find it again. however, once i saw it i felt compelled to not look away. i observed the object for about 10 minutes or

lost focus of it. it was very small and, like i mentioned before, if you looked away it was hard to locate again. however, it simply vanished. when i first saw the object i became very excited. i felt

noticed two lights vertical from eachother, stationary in the sky. at first, i thought they were stars, but being pretty familiar with my nights sky, i realized after staring at them for a minute that they were too big, pretty bright and werent any stars i was used to seeing, considering i'm in my backyard various times in the evening every night. once i realized they weren't stars or any type of satellite i had ever seen before, i reached down to grab a spotting scope next to me. as i looked back up after grabbing the spotting scope, one of the lights dimmed out and was gone. as i brought the spotting scope up to my eye to look at the other light, it dimmed out and disappeared as well. i looked through my spotting scope at the area where i seen the lights and could not see anything out of the ordinary in the area where they were. i have no pictures or videos of the event. it all happened pretty fast. i'm certain they weren't planes due to the fact that we are near the landing flight path of the local airport and see planes coming in for a landing a lot. i'm pretty certain they weren't satellites as i see, what i believe are satellites, quite often and even as satellites dim out as they are passing through the nights sky and move out of the light, i can still pick up my spotting scope and see them much longer through the scope than with the naked eye. i'm sorry that this is all of the information i have on these lights, but its certainly not the only strange things i've seen happen in the nights sky, almost certainly because we live close to beale air force base. thank

naperville road and was approaching the intersection of naperville and east warrenville road when i noticed five bright red orbs in the horizon. my attention was immediately captured, for these bright red orb shapes did not look like anything i had ever seen before. they were in an upwards crescent, like an upside down rainbow shape, or a smiley face. the light turned red at the intersection, and i was able to get a longer look. it was then i realized that these lights were not the airplane guideline lights that blink red to warn the planes they are close to ground. these were way too bright and large to be such a thing. to my amazement i noticed that these lights were actually moving at a slow steady pace. they were glimmering, or almost appeared to be vibrating. i was so entranced with these mysterious lights that i couldn't resist but to follow them. i turned right onto east warrenville road and quickly turned left into the parking lot of kjww engineering. i had a clear view of the orbs flight pattern, for my spot allowed me to see all the clear sky above i-88 west. as soon as i slammed into park the three of the five orbs suddenly flashed away, leaving three lights remaining. the red lights turned to a bright white, and formed themselves into a triangular pattern. the remaining three slowed to the pace that i first observed them at. i watched the lights for a few minutes before deciding to leave in fear. i went on to i-88 west  and observed three of the orbs still making their flight along the horizon, two were flying one atop the other, with one a few feet in front of them. this did not look like any plane, for the lights were rather large and very very bright. i felt a combination of shock, fear and numbness after seeing the orbs, which disappeared from my view point as i drove down i-88. i passed the orbs as i went on in traffic.It is hard to put the feeling i felt when i saw the orbs into words, for it was one i have never experienced before. i think it is because in the 13 minutes i viewed the orbs i realized that we truly are not alone in this universe. and that, is a very very very humbling experience. the pictures were taken in the parking lot of kjww engineering at 1100 warrenville road, lisle il, an intersection a 300 feet down east warrenville road, and i-88 west. the ictures were taken from my droid mini smartphone. you will have to zoom in amongst the bottom the pictures to see the orbs in a triangular pattern.

generally see a few planes flying overhead, either into charlotte- douglas or jus passing by. i have seen emergency and military helicopters fly by before as well. this object caught my eye because of the green and red colors that were much brighter than anything i have seen before here. i have been here almost 3 years in the concord area. i have lived in myrtle beach for 15 years, and delaware for 24 years or so. at first i thought not much of it, but it was pretty, so i watched. then it stopped and hovered. maybe 2 miles away at a relatively low height. then it began to move forward slowly in the same direction it was going originally. after a second or two the forward motion went from slow to amazingly fast across about a quarter of the sky. i was intrigued. it had stopped and hovered again. no noise. it began another slow movement at about a 90 degree angle and almost immediately accelerated again in a very unnatural rate to a point almost over my head. still no noise. at this point, i was very curious. it then hovered again over my house and then headed generally east for a short time before stopping again. at this point, i went inside to tell my mother what i was seeing her and to bring her out to look at it. when she came out in about 30 seconds it was still hovering about 1000 feet above the woods behind our house. she saw it as well and was also confused by it. after about another 30 seconds of watching it slowly move around, it finally went from a hover to a very high speed to the north. lost sight of it then. my mom went inside and i stayed out for another hour without ever seeing it return. the entire time it was visible, commercial airplanes were criss crossing the sky.

what sounded like a helicopter flying below the ridge line of the mountain behind us to from the south end to the north end. this concerned me because i could not see the helicopter but i could hear it and it was moving pretty quick and low. my wife went inside, i then walked out into the front yard and heard a roaring noise coming towards me from the west. i did not hear the sound until it was almost directly over me. it passed directly over my head at a speed i would guess to be around 3-5 mph. i was shocked by what i was seeing but i kept my head and never took my eyes off of it until it was gone, i will admit i was a little scared. the object had a green light in the front and blue and white lights in the rear. i would estimate it to have been about 100 feet long. the front was very narrow and grew in width with a wingspan i would guess was around 75 foot. i would not really call them wings, it is hard to describe but i could draw them. the object was gone as quick as it came and i lost sight as it continued to travel from west to east. the trees were bare and it just seemed to follow the treetops down the side of the mountain until i lost sight of it. after it was gone i was afraid i had seen something i shouldn't have. having had worked for a defense contractor i had a lot of exposure to military aircraft and i surely could not think of any planes that could fly that low and slow being as big as it was. i was afraid to say anything, i knew i had just seen something that changed my life, the way i thought about things and i even stopped going to church. i still have not told anyone what i saw including my wife and i probably never will. i think about this event almost everyday. i see military aircraft in my area a couple times a week but nothing like this object.

and 10:30 pm on september 17th, 2015. the sky was extremely clear with plenty of airplanes and stars out to compare to. i'm positive that these sightings were neither. each sighting was in the sky over dover, delaware in the wsw and wnw directions, respectively.\r\n\r\n#1 - a fat red spot in the sky appeared near the moon, visually approximately the size of a pencil eraser held out at arms length. when i first noticed it it was underneath the moon, relative to my viewing angle, in the sky. it hovered for about 10-15 seconds before darting quickly to the left and upward and stopped still resting to the left of the moon - again, from my viewing angle. the object hovered again momentarily before it darted upward and to the right toward the moon. the full motion was like a clockwise half moon. the object disappeared from the sky as it crossed the tip of the top of the moon. i want to be clear that i don't believe it physically went to the moon, rather it was just the closest object in the sky i can use as a point of reference.\r\n\r\n#2 - this sighting went on for at least 30 minutes. a smaller dot in the sky the size of an average star hovering and then darting and then hovering again. this object was doing very clear patterns. first squares. then triangles. then squiggly zig-zag motions up and down, left and right. this object performed very quick, sharp, angular motions. every motion would be followed by absolute still hovering for 2-5 seconds. the object was slowly working its way toward the south, but never stopped doing patterned motions as long as we tracked it. always hovering before each new movement in the pattern. the distance it would cover in the sky in each movement would be roughly an inch to two inches at a time if a ruler were held out at arms length and each destination would be reached in the same amount of time with the same amount of speed, regardless of how far it went each time.\r\n\r\nwe were absolutely going nuts trying to figure out what these objects could be. the red one was perplexing but the star-like one put on quite a show - and was still going as we left. there were so many other aircraft in the sky almost directly above us to compare these to and none of them even came close to what we were watching. the distance that these objects appeared at and the swiftness of their motions is what is most baffling to us.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"01:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then
