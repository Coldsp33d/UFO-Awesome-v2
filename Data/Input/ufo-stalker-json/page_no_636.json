relaxing next to pool in my backyard on a sunday morning.\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\n - when i recorded it, i basically wanted to test out the zoom feature on my lg g3 smart phone, and i saw the \"plane\" and thought it was a good opportunity to test it on a faraway object in the sky on a clear day.  so i saw the \"plane\" and began recording it.  since i was still learning the feature and trying to line up the lens to the object, i had some moments of shakiness with the phone and video filming.  i really didn't take notice to it to much, and decided to review the footage when i got the chance. that chance wasn't until three weeks later, after i had returned from some travelling up north to montana and yellowstone park.  what made me review the video in mid-september was that i actually was wondering if it was a plane or not, so i took a closer look at the footage.  \r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n - a plane\r\n \r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\n - the object traveled from east to west, but looked at though maybe was heading toward a ne direction.  not sure, but it travel along what looked like to be a straight line.\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n - during - thought i was filming a plane and testing my zoom.\r\n - after (reviewing the footage) - that is when i found it to be interesting and excited in what i just captured.  i'm still not incline to say it is \"extra-terrestial\", but it sure isn't some aircraft i am familiar with, especially being in a navy a-6e squadron for 3 yrs.  of all the airplanes i've seen, i've never seen something like this before, and trust me, i've seen a lot.  this one doesn't seem to have wings, but maybe small fins on the tail - which would lead me to believe it could be a drone of sorts.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\n - traveled out of my visible sight and behind houses and bushes.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:01:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":70611,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.154009258508616,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09182015-0028","longitude":-106.48172165443528,"occurred":1439722920000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1442615258000,"summary":"I thought i was filming a plane, but after viewing, it doesn't look like one.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":36,"maxtempi":97,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":28,"meantempi":83,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":20,"mintempi":68,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":36,"maxtempi":97,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":28,"meantempi":83,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":20,"mintempi":68,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"87111","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":33,"locationName":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7142"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Dundalk","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting on my deck at the rear of my house that faces east.I stood to adjust the deck umbrella when i noticed a bright red light moving toward my location at a low altitude from the southeast.The light reminded me of a road flare,slightly glowing.I watched it pass by at a seemingly slow speed, slowly turning toward the northeast in an arc gaining altitude,eventually fading from sight.The sighting lasted about a minute.The size seemed to me about the size of a golf ball if it was held at arms length.The object appeared to be a fireball or emitting flame and making no sound.","distance":"501 Feet -

porch saying goodbye to friends,and noticed  over their car in a northeast direction, high in the sky was a flashing light with white & red lights.It was very high in the sky, but you could still see it flashing. i thought it was an airplane, but it didn't move. i observed for over 25 minutes and it only stayed in the same area of sky. i thought i saw it moved slightly up and down a couple of times, but it mostly stayed stationary. i didn't know what it could be, so i decided to check the next nite. the next nite i went out 8pm and there it was again in the same direction, but the position was different, a little more north. it was the same flashing lights and stationary position. i observed this for 2 hrs. it happened again the next nite sept 7th same lights but now it was in the northwest sky. i then took video with my cellphone and took some pics. on sept 8th the happened again, the light in the west and stayed for hours. on sept 9th the light moved back to the east. sept 10-12 couldn't observe we had cloudy,rainy weather. again on sept 13th the light was back in the east. same for sept 14th, but on sept 15th it was back in western sky, i took pics this time.\r\non sept 16th, i observed 2 objects, one in the west and one in the east!! same lights and position. sept 17th-observed in western sky, i thought this was really getting weird so i took more video and pictures. each time i took video & pics i tried to stop when planes were in the area. i reviewed the pics and you can see different shapes and colors on each one from the night of sept 17th.  my husband and daughter also observed. today is sept 18th and i will check the sky again tonite.

called an \"et\".  i thought he meant the et from the movie, but he drew it and i drew it, too, from his words and this looks nothing like spielberg's et. this alien looks more like a grey, but with sharp teeth and 'bumps' on the arms.  i am unsure if my son means like muscles or something else.  he said it was about as big as him, so around 38inches at the time. i have asked him countless times how he felt when he saw the owl and then again with the et.  he said scared, but told me the et would not hurt him.  he said he is scared because the et is 'creepy' looking.  he says he is more afraid of the owl, though, than the et. he said he saw the owl and et when he was four.  he will be six in a week, on the 29th.  he said he had a pumpkin nightlight in his room, which tells me this happened around october 2013.  he says he has never seen the owl, et or light again, but still hears the voices.  the only thing i can add is some time ago, actually probably when he four and around the same time line he saw the owl/blue light, i saw a ball, slightly smaller than a volleyball, of golden floating light come out of my son's closed door and float down the hall way.  i remember thinking this is not a dream, but i wasn't panicked and i went right back to bed.  to this day, i wonder what i saw or what was in my son's room.","distance":"20 Feet or

long time.\r\nwe see tv shows about ufos and aliens together, a month ago i bought a book called \"the journey in for ufos.\"\r\nthe event took place over two minutes, i do not know what it was, the lights did not make a noise.\r\nit was not a plane or a helicopter! ma'aleh adumim has a military base of the israel defense forces.\r\nthere are many incidents in ma'aleh adumim. this is not the first time i see this kind of thing, my friends and i saw many times those lights, but only once i managed to film.\r\ni really do not know what it was, today it is one of the biggest questions remains to be explained.\r\nit's really interests me and i hope you come back to me a cell phone or email.","distance":"101-500
