campground is on the ridge of the mountain so you have views of behind and in front of the mountain. behind is a valley with farming and in front is a national park called rose valley and you can also see the ocean in the distance. from where our tents were the hill continued to go up and peaked at a rock formation which we went to see the view of our surroundings and to observe the stars before we went to bed. it was pitch black out, there are no lights up there, and the valleys below on both sides have minimal light. i was facing the direction of the ocean with my dog and my friend faced me, looking the opposite direction down into the valley below. the mountain range continued at a level height on either side of where we were so you could see (during the day) through the trees quite a ways. however, at this time we could not see 5 feet in front of us. my friend said \"hey, do you see those lights?\" and pointed behind me. i said \"that's not funny\" as i turned around to look below and told him it was probably a house or a car in the valley but he pointed next to us instead and said \"no, over there through the trees.\" i looked to my right and said 6 red lights moving around, side to side, and around each other almost in the shape of an infinity sign but they started morphing into each other going from 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 and then back up to 6 for about a minute or so. we observed them and at first i thought it was another camp ground but this ridge was above any of the designated camp grounds and we only saw campers in the other direction during the day. once they started moving i knew it wasn't a camp fire due to their fast movements and they were about 5-10 feet up in the air. after a few times of them increasing and decreasing in number they suddenly stopped at three, got in a straight line, and then seemed as if they were coming closer to us, as if they centered in on us and were coming closer. they must of only been about 200 feet away but at that point i got scared and my dog started growling so i ran over the rock formation back down the hill to our tents and yelled at my friend to follow. our tents were only 30 feet from the rock formation but i got into my tent with my dog, and my friend went into his tent, and we tried to fall asleep. as i layed there my dog kept looking in the direction of the lights and growled every so often until i fell asleep. today, i was watching ufo hunters, the episode on the tinsley park lights in illinois and honestly what i saw was so similar in shape and color that i am once again amazed at what i saw and also what people world wide have seen.

orbs?) one at each point creating the look of a triangle with one orb/star at each point of a triangle but not sure if they were part of one solid object or not.  it just seemed odd to see 3 bright lights forming triangles like that.  now my friend said she saw a couple of the stars in the triangles move a bit but i didn't so can't say for sure if they were part of a solid object or not.  just seemed odd.  now if they were part of a solid triangle then it was huge, like 2 football fields huge.\r\n\r\nthe multi-colored rectangular that was dancing around was something i have seen before in that same area about 2 years ago i would say, reported that to mufon as well.  i explained the appendages coming out the sides just like the one last night as well. same area over aylmer quebec. \r\n\r\nthis is my 5th sighting of ufos over the last 2 or 3 years and all have taken place in this one same area.  not far from me is shirley's bay which has a ufo reputation and i understand there are magnetic fields in that area as well so i have read.  this is an active area for sure.\r\n\r\nthere were no jets around but there were 3 airplanes coming in for landings as sometimes they shift flight paths to the airport here that is south of ottawa but the airplanes are obvious, these objects i am reporting were definitely not planes.\r\n\r\nlike i said last night's sky was filled with stars but it would be easy to miss a ufo in the many stars for sure so there could have been far more than the 3 that i saw for sure that i know were ufos of some kind.  not including the possible triangle shaped star? points.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"02:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s), Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":70570,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.3945087,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-09172015-0012","longitude":-75.84396029999999,"occurred":1442439000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Quebec","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1442487613000,"summary":"First saw a flashing linear shaped object, very clear due north and it was flashing blue, green, red and white.   then saw 2 or 3 other objects above it quite high up but they were only white and shaped like ovals","tags":["flash"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Gatineau, Quebec","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7211"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"LaFayette","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was bailing hay about dusk on the farm on shinbone ridge rd when i observed what i thought was a meter streak across the horizon in a south eastern direction. the thing that got my attention was maybe an hour or less later a jet fighter slowly crawled across the sky over the hayfield, he was so low i good see the silhouette of the pilot and the light in the cockpit. \r\n\r\nmy thought was the lights in the field attracted the attention of the pilot, who was apparently looking for something. the jet was barley moving, almost in a hover mode, i would never have thought a jet could stay in the air moving that slow and low. \r\n\r\nthe sheriff of our town advised many people complained that night reference low flying jets.\r\n\r\ni'm really guessing at the date, i remember the circumstance, but not the date. i may be years off.

saw the other two we knew what we were looking at it was a glowing white ball just hovering and then it moved quickly west then stopped again and then another one appeared next to it to the west they both just floated for a minute or so then the first object decended and then went back up really quick. at that time a bigger object appeared to the north/ west and you could see the grayness of the craft. it had flat, long lights in the back or all the way around it( i'm not sure). we watched all three hover for approximately 5 or 6 minutes and then the second object disappeared. at that time all my focus went to the big one to the north/east and it would hover in a half moon motion up and down at that time i took some pictures. we watched for a few more minutes then i had to go back to

michigan from elkhart, indiana on a two lane backroad, route m140. when all of a sudden everything on the car just went out, it went dead. it was so dark i could not see my hand in front of my face. i could see one farm house two or more miles away because it had a floodlight on it. there were no other cars or lights to be seen. the downside of it was i had no flashlight or a lighter and sat wondering what am i going to do. i was afraid to get out of the car because of the tremendous amount of roadkill i saw on the way to elkhart during the day. i feel the entities must have sensed my apprehensions and just as quick as everything went out they came back on and i continued on my way. i feel they decided not to take me at that moment. the following night i would return to missouri using us 95 west, to us 80 west, to us 55 south. when traveling on us 80 i could clearly see to the southeast the full moon. after a short time, thru the line of trees on the opposite side of the highway something caught my eye. i thought it was the full moon but i could not see thru the line of trees clearly. i was keeping my eye on the road and trying to see what was that. i was moving at 65 mph down the highway and kept trying to see was it the full moon or something else. that is the last thing i can recall while driving on us 80, just outside of chicago. my very next memory was slowly and calmly opening my eyes, my head was down and i could see i had two hands on the steering wheel where i normally put them. i slowly and calmly raised my head and looked out the front window and could see that the car was moving 55 to 65 mph down the highway. the car was going so straight down the highway that it was unnatural to me. how can this car be going so straight with me waking up from sleeping and i was not jumpy or nervous, nothing.I never got tired. i was calm and bewildered. i had know idea where i was or how i fell asleep. i immediately started looking for some signs along the highway and saw one that said i was now on us 55 south near bloomington, illinois. i figured out later that i was at least 250 miles from my last memory. as i continued down the highway i came to this farm road overpass and as soon as i got by it something across the highway caught my eye. behind this farm house with only maybe 1/7 of it showing and illuminated the color of a full moon, i could see something maybe 6 or 7 feet above the ground. slowly this spacecraft started moving from behind this farm house while i was applying the brakes and moving onto the shoulder of the highway. my window was up and i rolled it down because i had to make sure it was not a reflection on the glass, as the car finally came to a stop, i got out and continued to watch this spacecraft slowly reveal itself. once it was fully exposed, it stopped and just hovered for about 10 to 20 seconds, it was metallic and self illuminating, light expanded outward from it like a force field, yet a source of that light around it could not be seen. then suddenly while still the same height from the ground started moving to my left and started to get smaller. i say that because it was moving so straight and the shape of it was so detailed and uniform, i could not tell that it was moving away from me. it was like i was looking at something in 2d, on a flat screen. it took me 2 years to realize that it got smaller because it was moving away from me. i was so confident in what i was seeing,  my minds eye would let me see that it was moving away. the farm road overpass was elevated and stretched for maybe a 1/2 mile or more. the spacecraft moved over miles of flat farm land before it disappeared behind the elevated by earth farm road. during the time that the aliens had me, i can't recall anything..I feel that it was more of an enlightenment than an abduction..All i know is that they gave me enough info that lead me to seek and you shall find and once you know the truth, the truth shall set me free. i figured they wanted to make sure i revived or awoke ok. the car was never the same. whenever a screw or bolt from anywhere on the car was removed the hole it came out of moves and the screw or bolt will not go back in. i forgot to mention that it was not a bad experience because i can't recall anything and i got home two hours ahead of time..They wipe your memory for a reason and i can live with that. i have saw other spacecraft up close with detail that if you are interested i can tell you those details and draw pics. i also saw a documentary that had some air force pilots that saw one of the same crafts i saw and the animation is so accurate i was overwhelmed with emotion. thank you for your time and peace be with you.","distance":"101-500

i keep seeing them, it is like they are searching for something near my house. within two weeks i have seen them 4-5 times. i am scared and but intriged.I saw one again tonight. followed it to see if i was crazy and i saw it land. it is always the same type of vessel. and they don't mind coming very close to use almost in contact. first it fly normal and you could almost not notice the difference between a plaine. then it stops and stays put. then it might change direction a couple times looking for a place to land. before it disappear bright reds lights flash out it's rear and you can see it no more. the vessel has a curb and triangular shape . it is  hard to see what type of material because it stays always in flottation high enough yopu won't see with your naked eye. but you can notice by the way it navigates that it is not normal. white and red lights are under and around. most of the time it will be the only thing you see. when it lands something very bright and angular comme out of first vessel. a stretch of light connect both vessels. it is impressive to see how the brigth vessel is much larger and comes out of the first one which is it much smaller.But maybe the distortion cause by the brigth lights makes it appear small. i don't know how. but it happens to me all the time recently. the first vessel always stays in altitude up 10-20 feet above the other one while the other part lands. it is so brigt it tickles the eyes and you can hardley see if anything comes out it is brigther than anything i have seen and spakles alot millions of l<small lights tinkles to creat a form that might be a vessel. i don't want to go closer but i can show you where they landed the first and second time. they are always around the same time and hardley hide. i have never seen any activity of this kind before. but since the beggining of septembre they are always around my place. i think it is because i live near the airport.But honestly there is a big difference between a plane and what i have seen. human engineering don't fly this way!\r\n\r\nfirst time it appeared it was at a music concert. it went over the crowd and stared at the the stage, while a country band played. it was very close to us but high enough to make it look like a plane. it was at a air ballon festival. lots of air ballon in the sky all week-end long. we could see it was very large 60 feet wide maybe. my mom, my step dad and me stared wonderin what this vessel was and only understood what it was when it decided to leave. as well as sevral people on the site we have seen this vessel with white and red lights. i was sure i was going to hear about it the next day. lasted couple of seconds and flied in swirls and disapeared. how can so many people see that and not talk about it. did not see one mention in the internet or the news the next day that was sunday 6 sept 2015. the next day saw them again near the airport were i live, they landed same as tonight. one vessel on top and bright part comes out.In a crop field near the highway. tried to take a picture while driving on the highway near but nothing good came out. with my phone i can barely see what i pictured one little white dot. but i could see mant ligths and the shape of it. that means nothing since it can't prouve anything. i deleted thoses bad pictures. i thougth they would never come again. then saw them the 9 sept. flotting above my house, very high in the sky around the airport. always the same first vessel with few red and white ligths under, that can almost be mistaken for airplane, unless you watch it fly. tried to ingore them but they keep appearing.I would like your help to make certain i am not going crazy. i am not equiped to take pictures at night time and i don't want to make people around me go crazy. i need professionnel help to document these happenings. it is like it is temporary. they are here often searching for something and always landing around the same place. they like to land in the industrial section of the city. these sites are always well lighted and innoccupied during night time. their light can pass unseen by thousands of citizens who don't even have a clue. i believe when they do find what ever... i don't think we will see them again. please contact me soon. i know you might receive thousands of letters like mine but i would sure appreciate to have some help
