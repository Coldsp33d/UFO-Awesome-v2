immediately that it was a ufo, since i have seen them many many times before, over teesside airport.  the other witnesses are mormon and do not believe in such things as ufo.  \r\n\r\n\r\nthree of us

hovered, moving ever so slightly. after a few minutes it went higher and higher then disappeared, we thought behind a cloud.  nb have estimated the size against a boeing 737 usually seen in the sky at the same height and it was easily 7 or more times the size of an aircraft in the sky.\r\n\r\na minute or two later it reappeared slightly south of the first sighting, moved a short way then again

sight to see.  aircraft do not hover and this definitely hovered and appeared to be pulsating. we stood and watched the whole episode.\r\n\r\ni have always known that there are beings on other

was a distant plane. when it appeared to be changing direction, going back and forth at lightning speed, we called the others attention to it. after a few minutes the object did not move from view, and it began making 45 degree angle turns, and then returning to its original position. it continued with these maneuvers for approximately ten minutes before suddenly disappearing and not returning elsewhere in the sky. i am not terribly good at judging distances, but i feel comfortable in saying that this object was at least two or three miles away, which would place it over the atlantic ocean;

and in the opposite direction of venus' position), and oddly mis-shaped (like 2 stars of the same size and character overlapping about 40%, perfectly vertically... visualize a  number 8 where nearly half of the top circle has fallen into the bottom circle.)  while i watched it for nearly 40 minutes before going back to bed, it did not move, but its brightness would periodically dim slightly as if from cloud cover. i moved to several different rooms to hopefully get a better view and then went outside onto my patio for the best possible observation and to attempt to get a few pictures with my cell phone. to make the outdoor trip, i needed to deactivate our alarm system, which woke my wife who also came out to take a look for 5-10 minutes. she confirmed it was quite odd in its brightness, shape and location to be a star, but i must admit that her celestial knowledge baseline is much less than mine. my rational head is thinking it must certainly have been a star, but my gut and my analysis of the observation is that the data doesn't add up. i've never seen anything like it or even similar to it in that direction before. although there are some clouds tonight (sep. 16, its past midnight now), as we look into the eastern sky we can see some dim stars and airplanes flying over lake michigan along their usual flight paths... but there is no \"standout light\" in the location or region of sky that could possibly be whatever we saw last night. \r\ni took some photos, but they are junk, not worth sending. if desired, i could provide a sketch or more specific details. the sighting was nearly perfectly east of us and appeared to be quite far away in both distance and altitude, that's why i selected indiana as the location vs illinois.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":70536,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.4828144,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09162015-0004","longitude":-87.33281389999999,"occurred":1442287680000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1442369971000,"summary":"I saw/watched a very bright \"star-like\" non-moving light that was just slightly oblong, vertically, like 2 spheres slightly offset.

be a dim star that was moving to the south.  at once i felt that i was looking at a satellite as i have seen many pass over our area at night and this was moving at the right pace and had the right brightness.  as i watched it for about a minute i realized that there was a second satellite behind it about 4 degrees moving at the same speed and on the same line.  this seemed very unusual and something i had never observed before.  less than half a minute after i spotted the second satellite the first satellite suddenly grew in brightness and size until it had expanded to about 10 times it's original size and than just disappeared.  the second satellite continued as it had been for about another 5 seconds and than just faded from view.  i was amazed, and have given a great deal of thought to what i had seen.  the most realistic explanation is an enemy killer satellite shot down another and the government is keeping it under wraps.  but, that explanation does not consider how the second craft seemed to depart into deeper space nor the fact that an explosion in space might be hard to hide if done with conventional arms. perhaps it was aliens at war, i don't know what it was

on the other side of town an my neighbors outside were all talking about it , let's skip to around 430 pm my girlfriends at my house she's giving me a back massage she's freaks out because she saw a weird diamond formation of red dots on my back she took a few pictures on her phone then we obviously joked saying i got abducted me being an avid ancient alien theorist i for a little seriously thought it could've been , so we look up on medical page after medical page we find nothing but people asking questions about it no answers i found one person who wrote a long article who supposedly compiled a number of cases an said that there was very few people who had pain but a large number if not all who had the strange dreams , i'm a little scared now thinking i have some rare skin disease

not making any noises as per normal, especially the dog that was always barking at us during and after practices in the yard of the house right on the border of the park. then out of nowhere it just disappeared. i didn't see it go anywhere. it was just gone.\r\n\r\nboth my asst. coaches and i were kind of stunned i think because we were all quiet looking at the area it disappeared from. then we looked at each other and began to ask again what that was. the d-line coach said, \"well it wasn't birds.\" my rb coach said, \"maybe it was a military ship.\" now, not too long before that there was a military plane/historical plane show somewhere to the west of northglenn because during a game we had parents, and even my players, oohing and ahhing the planes, i remember a stealth bomber was there (loud enough to hear from where we were) and what they were doing. i said, \"yeah, probably a military plane of some kind.\"\r\n\r\nbut, for some reason this night and that object have bothered me ever since. i'm not sure why. i almost think i'm losing my dang mind because it will pop into my head out of nowhere and i just don't want to think about it anymore. i want it to go away.\r\n\r\ni hope someone there can tell me a rational, logical explanation of what the heck we seen. my d-line coach is a born-again christian, iirc, and my rb coach is a catholic-christian like me. i don't buy into this little green men thing. or i didn't. or i still don't. i don't know anymore. all i know is i hope by telling you this you will have someone come ask questions i can't think to ask and show me that what we seen has a rational/logical explanation. i know what i seen. i see it clear as day. not only am i a coach, well, retired coach due to medical issues making it impossible to be an effective coach, but i'm also an artist. so, details sort of stick in my mind for the most part because of being a coach and an artist. so, i know what i seen was real... how could all 3 of us have seen something, the same thing!, and it not be real. i just want someone to help me understand what the heck we seen and why it bothers me so dang much so it will stop bothering me.\r\n\r\ni read you have lots of reports and i understand you're busy. but, please consider helping me understand this. i would greatly, greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\ncoach.","distance":"101-500
