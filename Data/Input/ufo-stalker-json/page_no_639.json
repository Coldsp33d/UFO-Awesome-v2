in the sky that moved.  i put out the lights and watched the sky.  i saw a number of light patches in the sky.  \r\n\r\nit was cloudy and my first thought was that it was some kind of light show being projected from below, maybe an event or concert or something.  the lights moved from various positions in the sky into a central point and out again, their speed reinforced my thoughts that they were a projection from below as it was implausible that anything else would be capable of moving at the apparent speed that they moved.  as i watched i became conscious of a very large area of sky that seemed to be slightly brighter than the rest positioned at the point where the white lights kept sweeping back to.  it was very faint just a hint of greenish light barely perceptible in the clouds.  it was only visible for a few minutes and seemed to slowly fade out completely, sometimes being barely detectable and sometimes not.  i didn't see it any more after this, although the white lights continued for a long time.\r\n\r\nafter 10 minutes or so i decided to go outside for a better view.  there was no sound or other sensation. the lights continued to sweep across the sky back into their central formation and out again to various random positions.  sometimes there were only two visible, sometimes up to five or six.  occasionally they came together to form a line and seemed to have beams of light from the front of the formation - it reminded me of the crown on the statue of liberty. then they would resume their random movement.\r\n\r\nthis continued and i tried to take a video on my phone but it just came out black.  i then tried taking pictures and managed to get a few images with blurry faint patches of light in them.  i just took pictures sequentially hoping to get something useful.  because the lights were moving only a few came out very faintly in the pictures, most pictures showed nothing.\r\n\r\nthis had been going on now for over an hour and it occurred to me that it couldn't be a show or event.  there was no sound, no distant music and it was nearing midnight on a sunday.  i became worried and called my ex-wife on the phone.  she lives about two miles away; and asked her if she could see anything from her place.  she could not, but stayed on the phone and talked about what i could see as it continued.  i then went and looked out from the front of the house and at the rest of the sky to see if there was any activity anywhere else.  there was none.  only the area of sky extending away between the north and north west had these strange lights.\r\n\r\ni was still on the phone to my ex and she suggested that we call the police to explain what was going on and enquire as to whether they knew of any events or if anyone else had seen anything.  i agreed and she called them as i continued to watch the sky.\r\n\r\nshe called me back to say that the police had said that there were no events that they knew of and that there had been no other reports of these lights.  they said they would investigate and possibly send an officer to my house.  i never had a visit from them and heard nothing more.  i imagine they thought it a hoax.\r\n\r\nby now it was nearing 12:30 and i was very tired.  i went to bed, but could not sleep.  around 1:30 i got up and looked out of the back upstairs window.  the lights had moved much further away and there seemed to only be three or four of them.  they had moved maybe a mile to the north but seemed quite bright.  i tried taking some more pictures with my phone and some were quite successful this time.  the lights were closer to the horizon, just visible above the roof line.  the weather was deteriorating and it was raining now.  the lights became fainter, and harder to see, presumably because of the rain.\r\n\r\nby now i was tired, worried and frankly frightened by the imagined consequences of what i had seen.  i went to bed and slept on and off for the rest of the night.  when i awoke, which seemed to be every hour or so i went and looked out of the window but i didn't see any more lights.\r\n\r\na coincidence?\r\n\r\nin the morning i noticed that my rain gauge wasn't working.  i monitor and log the weather as a hobby and looked to see how much rain we had had in the night.  the display said 4700mm of rain; clearly an impossibility.\r\n\r\ninside the sensor is a small \"spoon\" which tips over when it fills with rain. it takes 0.5mm of rain for one \"tip\" operation.  there is a small magnet in the end of the spoon which passes a hall-effect sensor as the spoon tips, thus recording the amount. it appears that this sensor had recorded over 9400 magnetic operations overnight.  also the sensor was no longer working, sending random data to the weather logger.  \r\n\r\ni have a second 'commercially bought' weather station which has a similar rain gauge.  i keep two as a backup and to compare data between them and derive an average.  the rain gauge for the second station which is of similar design is mounted on the roof.  that too had recorded over 4000mm (8000 + ) operations overnight, but still appears to be operational.\r\n\r\nall this was on sunday night.  it is now tuesday morning.  i set up a 'security' camera last night to cover the same area of sky.  last night was clear and i looked out regularly.  there was nothing out of the ordinary to see last night.  i don't know if the camera is sensitive enough to record anything anyway but i have left it out.  today it is raining so i expect there to be cloud cover tonight. the same conditions as sunday. time will tell.\r\n\r\ni was going to upload my pictures but as there are around 30 of them it didn't seem that practical.  contact me if you want copies and i'll upload them.  they are about 900kb each.\r\n\r\ni decided to upload just the last few that show the lights best.  these are from about 1:30 when the lights were further away.  you can see them just above the roofs.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

were in the car my father was driving my mother in the back we were in a citroen c4 picasso which has a large sunroof. as we drove south passing junction 24a of the m1 we noticed an aircraft on its approach to east midlands air port the sky was still light and had broken cloud. as the aircraft landed i also noticed a small dot on the cloud it was several miles away. as it approached my father said \"there is a helicopter too.\" \r\nas the object approached it did not appear to be a helicopter there was no rotor there were no lights windows or markings. it was rectangular with a fin pointing toward the ground. it appeared very black i could not easily see its three dimensional shape i did not believe it was a ufo i thought it might be a bird, a balloon or a black bag but its shape remained consistent it gave the impression of being a jet black stone. it was traveling faster than the on coming traffic. it flew in a straight line and its slight appeared stable without any hovering. there were no exhaust emissions and no noise louder than the car.  \r\ni leant forward in my seat and watched it go overhead it at an altitude of 300ft and appeared to be traveling north i watched it through the sunroof my mother complained that she couldn't turn around to see it. it appeared to be a dot once more and i lost sight of it. at the time i didn't believe it was a ufo it became stranger as i thought about it and had no explanation for it. i regret not taking a picture or following it. \r\na few days later i had a dream about the incident where the object appeared to be a telescopic inspection basket for changing streetlights. i heard my self saying in the dream \"oh its only one of those.\" ","distance":"101-500

ambient light from the neighborhood and streetlights etc. the sky at the time was sparsely partly cloudy, low humidity, with fluffy clouds so there was visible blue ( but dark ) night sky and clear visible stars, jet planes etc. winds were calm. finished flying the quad and, wow, i was thinking, was this ufo stationary and just observing us, me, someone?  did they get startled because my quad out there? was too funny-weird to not take this incident \"freak-me-out\" serious. brought the copter back in and got goose bumps. :d p.S. my guesstimate of it's speed will be ~250-400 mph and

remote area.  after the object finished flaring up, i observed it as a very tiny pinpoint sized light.  as i watched it, i noticed that it was making very quick, subtle changes in direction.  i thought this might just be my eyes playing tricks on me.  all of a sudden the object made a very fast change in its direction and covered a great distance.  i knew then it was not my eyes playing tricks on me.  i observed many more of these sudden directional changes as the object zig-zagged all around.  the object then proceeded to head in a direction that took it north (with smaller zig-zags) until it disappeared over the trees.  this was followed by two more objects that exhibited the same type of behavior.  after these sightings, there was quite a bit of airline traffic coming into and leaving the (rochester?) airport.  this was followed by an unusually high number of satellites (very straight, quick, well-defined path).  as i stated, i often sit out at night watching satellites go overhead and this is the first time in my life that i have ever seen anything as unusual as this.\r\n\r\n- the lights with the very fast changes in direction and speed were very, very

the table side and looked at my phone to see what time it was and how much sleep i would not get. it was 12:23am. i turned on my left side put a pillow between my legs and put the blankets over me to snuggle in for the night. i could not sleep. all of a sudden i felt drugged. like when you have a procedure. i got loopy and my body was limp and the next thing i knew i was being carried/held in a standing position through a neighborhood like setting, not sure if it was my neighborhood but i was going along slightly above the trees. it felt like a giant object had a hold of most of my torso, but my head and feet were free. i was not going upwards just straight head at such a speed that the lights i seen were a blur. i felt the cool wind all over me and my hair was flying back ,like if you stuck your head out of car window but at such a high speed, that i have not experienced. i felt and said to my self what the hell is happening but at the same time is was very relaxing and peaceful. the next thing i knew i  was thrown down on my bed on my back. i felt a dominant being over me. i could not move but was trying to. i felt scared and the peaceful feeling was instantly gone. it was holding me down but not in just one spot. it was over my chest arms and legs. i could move my head feet and hands but nothing else. i felt a warm being on me. my first thought that came to mind was that a man broke into the house and was trying to harm me. i then knew it was not a man. i could not see it. i felt like something was put into my eyes that made me have blurred vision and that seemed like black smoke. i could not cry out for my son.I kept blinking at the same time to adjust my eyes but couldn't focus them. i knew it was not a human, but it was something else. it had a powerful sense, very dominate feeling. it was warm and very heavy. it felt almost like hair but it was not hairy, it was a blurred black presence. i could not breathe or move my torso. i tired crying out for my son but because i was constricted i could not. i was thinking i got to get free. i thought i was going to die. the remote control was laying next to me and i thought i could grab it and throw it through the window to set off the house alarm so my son could come help me. i could not do that either. i heard something saying do not move. it was not a voice, more like a mental message. i heard strange noises like a sound from an mri and other noises, that i cant describe by writing. i said it hurts stop. i told myself to get free and with all my strength i lifted out of it. at that moment it was gone. i instantly felt pain in my lower back/spine area and stomach. burning pain. my throat was extremely dry. i noticed that i was laying on my back with all the blankets and pillows off me. i was laying there like i was being held down. i was to afraid to get up from the bed. it felt like hours had went by. i reached over and called my son on his cell phone to come downstairs to my room. he did. i still could not get my vision back, my throat was dry and in a few minutes after my vision cleared the pain went away. my throat was still dry and i drank some water that was next to my bed. i got up from the bed and felt exhausted and looked into the mirror. my hair was all back just if i had blow dried it that way. i told my son what happened and we talked about it for awhile. we checked the doors, they were locked and the alarm was on. he kept the lights on for me. i was afraid because i knew it would not matter if the lights were on or off. i knew this happened to me and there was nothing i could do to stop it.  i just asked him to sleep in the living room which is next to my room for the night. i did end up going to sleep and woke up and went to work. i told my friend about the experience. as i told her about it, the time frame was off. i looked at my phone to check the time. i thought i called my son about 130am,because it felt like a long time but in fact it was only 7 minutes that this all occurred in. according to my cell phone it was 1230am that i called my son to come downstairs.  i am telling my story to further help me understand this experience. i do not take drugs, i am a professional health care provider, a respected member of the community and an overall normal person. this is crazy to me and i cant find a rational explanation. i do know i was not sleeping nor am i making this experience up to get any type of attention. i am hoping for any feedback, is there anyone out there that this has happened to? any response will be helpful.","distance":"20 Feet or
