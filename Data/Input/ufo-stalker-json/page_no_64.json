missile range. it came from the north down the east side of the range and did a u turn across the range (35 miles wide) and went up the west side of the range. two radars tracked the object, one at holloman afb and the other at the white sands missile range  headquarters to the south. speed was estimated at 1,200 mph. \r\n\r\ni was working at holloman air force base in nm. i am a civilian and asked one of the usaf officers, a captain, if he could verify the overflight of a reported ufo.. he came back an hour later and said that it was true. overflight was done at 1,200 mph, height unknown, and the object did a u turn that was 35 miles across. holloman afb and white sands test facility radars acquired and traced the object.  no known aircraft could accomplish such a tight turn at that speed. \r\n\r\nthe next day one of my coworkers said two schoolteachers he knew said they were on the east side of the range driving in the sacramento mountains and had seen a ufo come over them.  \r\n\r\nthe time frame is approximate as it was a long time ago and i am not sure of the year, but remember the details of the incidence. you probably have this incident in your mufon files. in my job, i tracked and photographed many rocket launches and recoveries and missiles coming into the range from utah and never witnessed a ufo incident. \r\n\r\ni once was driving across the range and a pick-up was about a mile ahead of me and clearly visible to me. some few minutes after that i came to a stop as there was a small missile 8\" or 10\" x 4 ', stuck upright in the pavement on my side of the road. it had to have landed after the pick-up went by and before i came to it. one of the dangers in working on that missile range. \r\n\r\nair in that region is very dry and visibility is usually unlimited. altitude at the missile range is apx 4,000 feet. i have seen venus overhead in broad daylight without use of any device - ie; binoculars or telescope.

saw the lights. all 3 individuals in my car witnessed this. none of the 3 individuals had taken any drugs/alcohol/excessive sugar/anything that could affect our vision or judgement. at first, we saw what looked like a very large spotlight in the sky, which wasn't too unusual being that it was new year's. the spotlight moved very rapidly in a circular motion and split up into various smaller-looking spotlights. they seemed to zoom around erratically for a few seconds, then reformed into the larger spotlight. it then broke up again and zoomed around erratically. it reformed into the larger spotlight then broke up into 10 smaller spotlights and formed a semi-circle in the sky, which then remained stationary. we arrived at our hotel and they were still visible; these smaller spotlights then remained stationary in the sky until at least 2am, when i had to (unfortunately) go to bed. they mostly stayed the same the whole time, the only change i really noticed was that over time the lights somewhat dissipated and became duller, but stayed in the exact same shape the whole time. i will attach two photos i took. i felt incredulous throughout the whole ordeal, and kept thinking, \"is this real life? are we being attacked in this new year?\" i didn't feel threatened though, i almost felt as if they were extraterrestrial, all they wanted was to observe our new year's celebration or something? it was very strange that not too many other cars or people nearby seemed to even look up or care. the lights were very apparent in the sky, i just hope that someone else in

vegas to visit my son. i am not sure what state we were flying over but i was about an hour or so before landing. \r\n   i felt the planes engines slow down and wondered if the pilot was being notified to slow down to avoid other air traffic.  i was looking out the window to see if i would be able to see anything when a (typically described) flying saucer or silver disc shot across the front of the plane and on to the east side of the plane.  i had the window seat and immediately jabbed the poor guy sitting next to me with my elbow and said look!  i wanted a witness. lol  he immediately jabbed the guy next to him and the three of us sat there with our mouths open.  \r\n    it was a shiny silver disk with no wings and no tail.  completely round and saucer shaped.  it had a heat wave type shimmer coming from the rear and was going at an incredible speed. it was way out of sight in seconds.  i knew that this had to be ours (u.S.) because it had obviously been relayed to the plane to slow down to avoid contact since you could obviously feel the plane slow down.  my primary thoughts at the time was where are we getting this kind of technology??\r\n    when we landed in las vegas the pilot was standing at the door.  i stopped and asked him what that was that had passed so close to\r\nthe plane.  he mumbled something about turbulence when landing and i said no, this was about an hour or so ago.  he got a funny look on his face and sort of looked at the ceiling and said in a voice that meant just the opposite \"i didn't see a thing\".  i laughed and exited the plane.\r\n\r\n    i told my son about it that evening and he said he knew someone from church that everyone sort of knew worked at the new area 51, or at least every monday he gets on a plane and about an hour or so later gets off for work and is flown back home later.  \r\n    my son described what i had seen to his friend and he kind of smiled and all he said was \"that sounds about right\"\r\n\r\n    while watching the josh gates episodes about ufos the guy on there kept saying there was no technology out there that could duplicate what people were seeing.  well there is and we are duplicating it.  what i saw was a true flying saucer.  i wish i knew what else it could do and where we are getting the technology from.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

my brother and i were playing at dusk when my brother told me to look in the sky at the ufo.  i looked up and saw a silver disc descend, ascend the zoom away.  my brother and i were very excited.  we told this to everyone we knew. no one knew what to do and most people didn't believe us. my brother and i were telling the truth about what we saw and it looked like what we saw identified on tv as ufo's. i was fortunate enough to have a neighbor who took this seriously and told my family and i about her own experiences, expertise and knowledge about what my brother and i initially reported. this neighbor told us there was a radio station that would talk about this because there were a lot of people reporting many unexplained and unknown, ufo and other events, experiences, and sightings like we did.  since we were children regarding this initial event, i believe that is why no one we knew ever pursued this in our behalf. - prior to this first incident and throughout the duration of my life from childhood to present, many unexplained and unknown events, experiences and sightings first occurred in this area which may all be related or separate.  this initial area was once the home of three american indian tribes, there is sacred land and indian artifacts everywhere.  over the years, the pattern is that i have had many other unresolved events, experiences and sightings with the unexplained and unknown in many areas i lived; california, new york, pennsylvania, and england.  every area i lived where this happened i contacted a variety of experts who all had differing opinions that all i got out of it was confusion, frustration, temporarily giving up, more fear, isolation and to date this continues and remains unresolved. to date, i remain very scared, and can't be alone in the dark.  my own research, past and present showed that in all the areas this occurred were areas that had others having the same and similar experiences ant not being able to resolve them.  i have my own cross over theory about this and need to speak with credible experts in those fields to see if they are related.  no one i researched has explored what i think might be a crossover discovery into more than just ufo's.  note: i will only share this with credible experts who can show their credentials, like mufon.  please help me solve this.","distance":"101-500

townhome approx 4-5 foggy oval lights circling in a rotation.  at first i thought this was an event spotlight since it was in the christmas season but there were no beams to the ground.  over time they joined together to make one circle in the middle then they would break apart and repeat the same rotation.  i reported in this mufon form this went on for a half hour, that is all i noticed but for all i know this was going on prior to my 8:30 pm notice of the event.  my dogs did not seem agitated nor did they even look up but i felt i should bring them in the house.  i kept checking every 5 mins or so and the same thing would happen.  i am not tech savvy and don't have a smart phone but i filmed this with my digital camera and couldn't see anything once i looked into the camera frame and unfortunately deleted what i filmed.  i should have uploaded it bc then the objects may have been visible from the computer screen so i don't have any footage.  i called my neighbour behind me and he went out to look as well and was perplexed.  he too did not take any pics.  toward 9pm i checked again and this time smaller circles were around the bigger ones, as if they broke from the bigger lights perhaps.  next check they were gone.  bc i was busy decorating for xmas i didn't check or report anything until a day or two later.  again bc i had no footage i looked online for anything similar.  the nearest comparison is a youtube video called \"mysterious white lights circling in the sky\", that video shows similar colour, size and movement.  the ones i saw however were rotating in sync and adjoining in the middle, coming apart, circling and joining on a consistent basis until the final check when there were also smaller circle.  i asked another neighbour of mine who is an airport firefighter, he felt it may have been powerful laser lights and if that were the case i should report this to navigation canada so such pranks could be investigated as they pose danger to planes.  i emailed nav canada and have received no response.  i also called peel police and this was dismissed and not taken seriously.  i asked if there were events in the area that may have contributed to some sort of spotlight and was told no but no interest beyond this was given other than the officer did ask if i had a photo and i explained that i deleted what i filmed regrettably.  he said no one from my neighbourhood or surrounding subdivision reported anything other than myself.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:35:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":89242,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.56835312160896,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01012018-0011","longitude":-79.75974759996032,"occurred":1511555400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1514811555000,"summary":"4
