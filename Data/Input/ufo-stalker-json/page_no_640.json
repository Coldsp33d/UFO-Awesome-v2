sun goes down within an hour multiple star like lights will seem to appear out of nowhere more or less winking in. all the lights are composed of two points of light next to each other and the altitude is way too low for them to be stars. they hover there stationary for a few hours and normally since i do not want to spend the night on the beach i will leave before i know where they go to. i have seen the lights further inland but it is not as easy to see because of the traffic and city lights. i have seen some of them winking out and where they go i do not know. i have seen a few that after hovering for about an hour will slowly move off to the left or right. i do not believe that they are stars because they are all twin points of light close together. i was curious if this was a phenomenon that was only occurring in florida. i went up to dayton, ohio to visit relatives for a week and made it a point to observe the night sky there and saw the same lights only not as many. i saw a film clip of when the small fleet of flying objects flew over the white house shortly after world war two and they did a close up shot. the objects had 2 points of light just like what i have seen. my question is if there is a grid of craft hovering over us what is their purpose? some nights there are just a few other nights there are a few hundred. for any one who wants to check it out clear nights are best. on some overcast nights you cant see anything. would send photos but don't have the equipment. just had to tell some one who can appreciate my message. thanks ","distance":"Over

this point i could not take my eyes away, the three lights were moving very fast in strange ways and i deduced that it was no star or plane.  the odd movements made no sound the lights gave me an almost playful feeling and i even remember smiling.  this light show lasted about ten minutes when all three suddenly disappeared. i waited a few minutes to see if they would reappear and while i was waiting a helicopter came quietly from the east.  i am a military veteran and i have never seen a helicopter move that quietly.  the quietly moving helicopter went right to where the lights were until i could see it no longer.  my neighbor caught the very end of the lights and she said she witnessed something similar the previous evening. i later found out about mufon and decided to

stopped at the twin lakes area to shoot some photos and did not notice anything strange until i got home and was looking at the photos.  when i first looked at the photo in question, i thought to myself, what is that object in the upper right corner of the photo, because i did not notice anything when taking the photo or anything while sight seeing in the area.  i have always been interested in ufo's and always wanted to witness one for myself, so i was disappointed that i did not see the object until i got home.  i looked at the photo very carefully and did some adjustments to the photo because i always take photos in jpeg and raw, so i am able to make adjustments with the raw format photo.  i could never get the object in the photo to become very clear, but could see some small details that made the object appear round in shape and dark in color.  i thought that since the object was not clear that it must have been far away from where we were when i took the photo.  it was a bright day and i had the camera aperture set at f3.5, iso set at 400, resolution set at 6016 x 4000, and lens set at 22mm.  with these settings the camera automatically set the shutter speed at 1/250

a sudden i saw a large blue circular light hovering above my neighbours house across the road. the unknown object was the size of a small plane about 100ft away from me. it was covered in blue orbs of light that brightened the night sky. it made no sound what so ever. as i was looking at the object i got the feeling that i couldn't move. i was just looking at it i couldn't move no mater how hard i tried. i felt terribly scared as i didn't know what was going to happen. i started to sweat uncontrollably as i tried to move. then suddenly it vanished after 3 minutes and reappeared within 30 seconds. it changed the colour from a light blue to a white light and continued to hover over the house to the north east whereas it was north of the house the first time it appeared. it continued to hover for another 4/5 minutes before it vanished for good. once the unknown object vanished i was able to move my body again. i had sweated so much that my bed was completely wet. i didn't mention

meteors.  i had recently bought a large refracting telescope and was just in the process that week of looking for a place to set it up.  so, i was sitting there relaxing (no drinking) and i see a star-like light moving in the southeastern sky.  nothing strange about that since i live between philly and baltimore and there are always planes on their flight paths.  however, this light was moving across those paths rather than along them.  it had no strobe and i heard no sound.  it was a quiet winter night.  i figured it was a satellite and thought \"how neat.\"  it was moving fast and was the size of a large star in the sky but not venus-like.  well, as i watched it move across the sky, it suddenly flashed and grew twice it size for about a second then simply disappeared from view.  it did not grow smaller.  it simply disappeared.  well, i thought that i was strange and that i must have been mistaken.  then a second star-like light that i had not been tracking moved from an angle into that same approximate spot about 30 seconds later and did the same thing...Flashed to about twice it original size and disappeared.  so, i am confident that both did this.  nothing more that i could tell.  but after 33 years with the army and seeing lots of \"interesting\" things, this was not normal.\r\n\r\nso, actually i think this is the second time.  about a month before in the western sky, i see a very similar thing...Small time of night but the star-light is very tiny...Barely visible.  i definitely thought that it was a satellite.  it did not flash but simply disappeared from my vision.  it didn't reach my horizon so i wondered why i couldn't see it. it was moving faster than the typical aircraft flights i see each day.  but, then, three more small moving light came from different angles into that general spot in the sky and disappeared as well.  plans don't converge from different angles and satellites moving across the sky don't come in threes or fours.  so that's my story.  was watching your tv show and thought i would at least drop this note.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

the two owners on june 4 2015.  at about 11 p.M. one of the owners noticed a bright light when looking out of a back window.  we thought it was the moon but quickly realized that it was much brighter.  we went outside and observed a very bright white light hovering over lake ontario directly behind the house facing south east.  the sky was clear with no noticeable clouds.  we also saw the moon further to the right (south).  we then looked at the light through binoculars and it appeared to be a flat surfaced diagonal circle made up of many white lights. i got out my camera (nikon coolpix l120 with 21x zoom) and took several photos and videos.  i put the camera on a tripod for some of the shots.  through the camera lens the object appeared to be more of a yellow-orange colour.  it was round but seemed pitted and had an interior outline (like a pizza crust).  the outermost edge was fuzzy.  in the video you can see that it was pulsating.  in some photos there also appears to be a small red circle to the right of the main circle.  it cast a large reflection on the lake.  it did not appear to be moving but at times it would suddenly disappear and then reappear in another spot nearby about 10 seconds to one minute later.  we were baffled and excited.  at approximately 11:50 it suddenly disappeared.  i stayed outside for about 20 more minutes but it did not reappear.  i have

all i noticed was a white-ish blue-ish glow, but i quickly focussed and saw the shape. we only saw it for a few seconds, (it was already almost halfway across the sky when she pointed it out.) but i got a pretty good look at it. it large a v shape. my father, mother and i could see a defined edge to the shape, while my sister only saw dim glowing lights. the lights looked to me like little dimly glowing spots. they weren't like the star reminiscent led looking lights on planes. they looked more like the light of glow sticks that had been left out for a few hours. there was absolutely no sound during the entire incident which was strange because at the height it appeared to be, we should've heard something. the path it took was really steady and straight. it moved more like it was an object rolling across a frictionless surface or something gliding in a straight path than something using thrust or wind propellers. \r\nmy initial feeling was a mixture of amazement and disbelief. i was freaking out, but i wasn't afraid. i really wished i could see more of it. my immediate thoughts about it were that it seemed almost exactly like what some people had described the beginning of the phoenix lights story to be (not the bright lights like in the videos,just the accounts of some of the suburban families.) my first assumption was that it could've been some secret stealth craft testing by hunter army airfield, but my family seemed to disagree. \r\nwe eventually lost sight of it when it flew out of view behind the trees.

tell it was not anything reflecting. my whole family agreed that it was a sold, v shaped vessel with glowing lights on the bottom. when it flew above us, it made absolutely no sound at all. not even a

cottage in the north kawartha area of ontario, canada, near a town called apsley.  there were four of us that weekend including the host and hostess.  around 8:30 that evening, after dinner, the host declared \"they're back\" while peering out the window.  \r\n\r\nwe all walked over to see what he was looking at and discovered a very bright, star like light across the bay, a few miles from the cottage.  at first i tried to find an explanation for the light, but the more i looked at it the less natural it seemed.  it was stationary, hovering in one spot but it seemed to also flicker.  it appeared to shift in shape and glowed in changing colours.  the light could have been a star, but it was much brighter than any of the other stars in the sky that night, especially considering how close it was to the horizon.  it reflected clearly in the lake below. \r\n\r\nthis got me intrigued and although at first, i admit, i thought perhaps the host was leading me on and knew exactly what this strange sight was.  maybe it was something he did with all his guests to make a quiet night a bit more exciting. they both insisted however, that the light was unexplainable to them as well and that it came back weekly during the summer.  their stories continued and i started to reach for my digital slr and tripod.\r\n\r\nwe walked out to the shore and i set up my tripod, focused across the bay at the strange light.  at this point, it had already been 15 or 20 minutes since the host spotted it.  i took a few snapshots and changed my settings to get a some different lighting options. it was very difficult getting any light into the lens as it was extremely dark and moonlit.  i opened my shutter speed and hoped for the best.  after about 30-40 minutes hoovering, the object seemed to zoom off in a western direction at light speed.  it was gone. \r\n\r\nwhen i got back into the cottage i opened my laptop and started looking at the images i took.  to my surprise i captured 2 images back to back which were taken within 10-15 seconds of each other.  the photos are untouched and straight off my camera.  it's visible that the foreground trees and background trees are sill and sharp.  with my nighttime shutter speed, blurring was a concern, however i believe i have captured this thing making small movements in the night sky.  as seen in the circled zoomed in view, the light is bright and it is moving. it's clear that the object is close to the horizon line and is even reflecting in the lake below unlike the stars that night.\r\n\r\ni believe what we witnessed that night was something extraterrestrial.  what do you make of these images?","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

and off to the right (sw). work gets out at 6:30 pm, so we must have noticed it around 6:35 - 6:40. my friend noticed it first, and made a comment something to the effect of “wow that is a bright cell phone tower, when did they put that up?” being familiar with the area i knew that there was no cell phone tower nearby, and i realized that it was much higher in the sky, at that point in time, than a cell phone tower would be. as we continued driving down the road, toward the object, we began to intently watch it as we drew closer. the light was a very bright white, almost like the lights you would see at an outdoor football field. eventually we noticed that there was not one light but three shining directly toward us. we both began to get a little unnerved, and said to each other that it must be a plane coming in for a landing because it appeared to get lower to the ground, but there are no airports/landing fields in the general area. we continued to watch it as it came closer, and were looking intently for strobe lights or red and green wing lights that a plane would normally have. it ended up having none. at this point we actually parked our truck in the middle of the road to watch as it past low overheard. it seemed to move very slowly across the road, somewhere between 500 and 1,000 feet over our heads. as it passed slowly over us we noticed that there was no landing gear visible, the body of the craft was a black/dark solid triangle, and it appeared to have six of the bright white lights. one at each point, and one centrally located between each of the lights on the points. it also had one sold red, unblinking light on the bottom center of the craft. we had our windows rolled down and could hear no sound whatsoever. as it passed over us, going nw, it abruptly seemed to change directions slightly toward the west without banking or making any type of obvious turn, and disappeared over the tree line. we were in a moderately wooded, residential area, however there seemed to be little or no traffic or people outside on the street. on a side note, several hours before we left work, my friend did see a twin rotor type, military helicopter fly over our worksite. i did not see it myself, but did hear the sound of the helicopter pass over my building.
