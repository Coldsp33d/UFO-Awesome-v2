returned from the foofighters concert and was laying on my recliner at my campsite.I don't smoke weed nor do i drink nor did i use any psychoactive drugs. there are no lights and the stars were beautiful, clear skys. at first i saw what looked like a shooting star almost overhead going north to south. right where the shooting star stopped about 2 handwidths above the southern horizon i see what looks like another shooting star moving from where the first object ended. at first i thought it was yet another shooting star but it traveled a bit slower. by slower i mean the shooting star took about 1/8th of a second to go from directly above to the 2 handwidths above horizon. this object took about 1 second to go the same distance. i could see white and red and thought at first it was a multicopter. the white and red seems to go out and appear at another area on the object. i literally fell out of the recliner to observe this(i watch for ufos all the time)and reaquired visual after about 1.5 second not seeing it. just as i saw it again it was near the northern horizon and turning what looked like a 30 degree angle northeast. i heard nothing. like i said my first impression was a multicopter by the lights, a multicopter at about 500 feet. i have never in my life seen anything that traveled as fast as this. i saw it for maybe 3 or 4 seconds. could have been an aircraft or a multicopter out of control maybe but by my estimation it traveled 10-15 miles while i saw it in about 3-4 seconds.","distance":"Over One

after i went to bed, i woke up to a strange high-pitched whistle. i glanced at my phone and noticed the time. my cat, who had been asleep on the windosill, woke and stood up from his spot very quickly. the whistle continued for approximately five to ten seconds before cutting off abruptly. as soon as it finished, dim light flashed briefly inside of my room. after it disappeared, i got out of bed and checked out the window my cat was standing in. across the street from my house, there are a few houses lining the road with dense trees behind them. a few trees separated two houses from each other. there is a small opening in one of the trees. i looked out to where my cat was staring and i noticed there was a dull gray smudge filling the opening. there was a sliver of the gray top, a dome- like shape, over the trees as well. i grabbed my cat and ran to my sister's room to see if she had noticed the sound as well. she had fallen asleep with a pair of headphones on, which may have blocked out the sound. on my way back to my room, i noticed that my other cat was staring across the street out of the door as well. i left the cats by the door and returned to the window. the gray smudge was still there. i live on a usually very busy street, but there were no cars going by at all. i watched the spot for a very more minutes before i laid back in bed. i would have kept watching, but had to wake early for an event. when i woke again a few hours later, i noticed a few branches had fallen from the trees that the object at been behind. i asked my sister if she had been whistling before bed and she said that she hadn't, she had fallen asleep before me. she didn't recount anything about a whistle or such, and i have not heard anything from the neighbors.

further away than the mountain).   after that caught my interest i panned around the photo while zoomed in and found yet another object in the same frame.  the second object was more clear and definitely in the shape of a perfect sphere.  the shadow cast on the sphere seems to match the angle that the sun in hitting the mountain as well.  the first object (closest to the mountain doesn't seem to have a distinct shape and maybe an airplane but the more distant one is without a doubt a sphere.  too small to be the moon, and way too large to be a distant planet which i don't think is possible to see in daylight with a regular camera.  my first instinctive feeling was this was not of this world.  there seems to be no strings or cables to indicate a weather balloon.  personally in

we both go out on my small deck and sit down on the steps, she was on the 2nd step, i was behind her on the 3rd step. it was thursday and a particularly dark night and most of the neighbors in my townhouse community had their lights off. i could see all the stars and planes flying overhead. i always look towards the sky, and am interested in the ufo topics, but i never thought i would see anything. about 9:50 or so i noticed something in the sky from the east flying westward. this object(s) had about 10 white lights from what i recall, shaped in a structured triangular pattern. judging by distance, it couldn't be more than 150 yards away. the lights were not shiny bright but matte white or grey white. it glided across the sky making zero noise. immediately my heart jumped and my adrenaline went off, i knew this wasn't normal. i said to my girlfriend, \"what the f!#* is that?\" \"do you see that?\" she said yes. it was going at least 30mph i think. i was in shock trying to identify what this was. it wasn't a plane they make noise especially at that close off proximity, or birds because birds don't glow in the dark or move that fast, and in that way. i thought maybe a glider but about 3 seconds after i witnessed this, the triangular pattern lights broke formation and started swirling around each other or swarming type pattern for another 2 or 3 seconds, until it flew out of sight, over my roof line. i think i saw it for about 5 or so seconds in all. i sat there in shock for about 20 seconds, before i got up and ran to the side of the house to see if i could get another look at it. when i went around the corner it was gone. after analyzing what i just saw, i thought it was mechanical not biological. maybe drones, but ten in perfect triangular alignment making no noise and gliding that fast with lights on them, i thought no. i asked my girlfriend what she thought it was, she said birds maybe?, but that was quickly ruled out when we thought about the quickness and no birds light up or fly in that way, and i don't think they fly at night. she had no answer and didn't want to think about it much. she said \"well supporting my bad habit of smoking and coming with me outside, you got to see a ufo.\" she thought that the object didn't break apart but the wings/object turned making the lights look like they were moving independently. when we went back in from witnessing it i noticed the clock was at 9:58.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

my cell phone in my hand i open the blind and took a picture after taking picture i looked at it and the star changed to a round white sort basket ball size object i took another picture looked at it the shape had changed to a boomerang look. i went back to my room took picture toward my window looked at it saw a orb in my room. the orbs i had been seeing outside since i purchased a security camera two months ago from adt on the screen. i told a adt tech. he said he has never seen this before. white orbs white outside and purplish color orbs in my house and at my windows outside mostly with faces men and women young and older looks and in them when enlarged even seen in trees in back of my house i seen a young man in jean the side view one night in back of the orbs as if walked across my window.The orbs i see in my home only show head like object sometime with things sticking out of it just above forehead. getting back to sighting i took a picture of my great room which

know 30 minutes or longer.\r\ni went back to bed i did not feel scared but cold and covered up. i do not know how long it hovered i do know at my window i seen it get light then dark and continued for

soul.\r\n\r\ni am 62 years old and while watching re-runs of the x-files a long forgotten memory resurfaced.\r\n\r\ni was 17 and spending time at the family vacation house in becket, massachusetts.  it was summertime.  it was warm but not humid.  i don't recall what phase the moon was in but i remember it being bright and cloudless. i was standing in the front yard.  it was nighttime.  for reasons unknown i looked up to see the stars.  after a moment or two i saw a light no larger than a star rapidly move approximately two inches across the sky right to left.  it stopped momentarily then moved the same distance left to right and back again.  it then moved up, right, down, then left.  as i think about it, it reminds me of the lines drawn on an \"etch-a-sketch\".  i watched it move for one to two minutes or until my neck began to hurt.\r\n\r\ni never again saw this phenomenon.\r\n\r\ninstinctively i knew what it was and felt no surprise or fear.  i did not then or do not now believe any country on earth was technologically advanced to have such a craft that could manoeuver as it could.\r\n\r\nthis event i considered extremely personal and buried the memory deep within my sub-conscious until now.\r\n\r\ni must tell you that i am not so egomaniacal as to believe humans are the only intelligent life that exits in the infinite space that god created.\r\n\r\nalso i do not believe in the \"big bang\" theory or that science and the belief in a higher power are mutually exclusive nor do i believe something can be created out of nothing since nothing does not exist.  god is everywhere in the form of energy we cannot measure or see.\r\n\r\ni have experienced some wondrous and inexplicable moments in my life and i don't believe anything is impossible.\r\n\r\ni do wish governments were more transparent and would freely tell people what they know about extraterrestrial biological entities.  it is my belief people would exhibit curiosity and a great debate would begin on the merits of the search for extraterrestrial life.\r\n\r\nafter dedicating countless hours to this subject, it is my considered opinion that only when science can create manmade wormholes will we be able to reach out to other intelligent life in moments not lifetimes. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

2) it appeared to be over 5 miles away, directly in the direction i had seen jets come from nyc headed to europe over a thousand times; 3) this light was hovering, steady and less than 1/10 the altitude of a jet: 4) while the jet had white, red and green lights strobing, this object was steady, no red, no green, no white.; 5) the jet appeared to be 50% larger in size than the bright orange light, only vaguely outlined (but no contrail).  \r\ni immediately announced that i recognized it as a helicopter on a course from ct or western ma to boston and that \"the light was orange due to distortion.\"  at 8:46 i heard a jet pass directly over the house from ne to sw, it appeared to be a typical europe inbound to nyc at 40,000 feet, with contrail visible in moonlight, and flashing lights.  when 3-5 miles southwest of us, with diminishing jet noise, with the wings of the jet visable in the moonlight, the hovering orange craft shot upwards in elevation and a direction ne directly at the jet, at a speed that was 3-4 times that of the jet.  i thought they would collide, and had i not seen it previously hovering, i would have thought it to be a missile.\r\nwith the orange light craft superimposed on the jet,the orange craft was about 1/2 the size of the jet passing over lexington at 8:46 pm. immediately after,i saw the jet continue in a path toward nyc, but the orange light hovered at an altitude matching the jet at least 1/2 the way from my position from when initially seen, directly west of my position.  after 15 seconds, the orange craft accelerated to 3-4x jet speed in a new due east direction at altitude of approx. 40k feet and disappeared to the east over the atlantic ocean. there never was any sound of a jet, plane or helicopter.  there was no training with jet fighters at hanscomb afb that night.\r\nan additional issue, from when the orange craft was first sighted, there was a blue light that was 10 times smaller or less bright that was moving from south to north and north to south in the immediate area of the horizon where the orange craft was seen.  this encompassed less than 5 degrees of moving from about a bearing of 235 to 245 degrees.  i did not even look for the blue light for the next 10 minutes, watching only the orange light.  when the orange craft disappeared over trees to the east, the blue light was still present, appeared to move a few degrees north, then south, then disappeared over the western horizon.  \r\nthe orange craft made no noise, no contrail, emitted steady light, had no appearance or lighting of a jet, it accelerated from a hover to speed of at least 2k mph instantly, and i was overcome with fear it would collide with the westbound jet.  that jet and radar images will have to show something.

territory every year to capture large active storm with video and still photographs. i live in perth western australia.\r\nmy wife and i stay at the same hotel every year and have a balcony with unobtrusive views of the ocean.\r\nwe set up multiple cameras and and video equipment to capture large active storm cells from the balcony.\r\nthis particular night we watched a massive active cell slowly form out to sea and very slowly make a direct passage over us. from formation to moving over the top of us was over 5hrs.\r\nwe had two video cameras, two dslr cameras with lightning auto triggers and a iphone 5s using a lightning trigger app.\r\nall cameras were pointing at different angles to capture close strikes.\r\ni only saw the objects when a lightning strike illuminated the two objects for about 5 seconds. it was the only time i saw the objects in the storm.\r\nthe black object stood out more so then the silver saucer shape object embedded in the cloud to the right of the black object. the black object was in my full vision. i voiced out loud \"what was that!\" my wife said \"what\" i said it was there for a few seconds near the cloud.\r\ni'm not sure what the black object was when i first saw it as it appeared to be changing shape very quickly. my mind was trying to process what just happened and what i saw.\r\nthe silver shaped object appeared in my side view and the top of the silver  object stood out as the flash of the lightning enhanced it more so. \r\nthe two objects were stationary for the brief time i saw them. only i saw them and not my wife. she was looking in another direction to the objects.\r\ni was standing next to the iphone 5s, which was on a small tripod, when i heard it click when the photo was taken of the objects. i knew straight away it captured the angle were i saw the objects as i was in line with the view i set it at.\r\nthe iphone 5s was using a app that triggers the photo. i have used it many times to take photos of lightning. it can be very accurate and reliable to capture footage. i only use it as a back up when i don't have my dslr camera with me.\r\nthis particular night the storm cell was so active i wanted to cover the whole storm with all cameras. i had set the iphone 5s app settings to be for a close strike so the setting washed out the far strike picture because the iso was so high on the iphone. the app will change the iso or it can be set to a solid value depending on how you want to take the photo.\r\nthat night of the objects being capture there were no birds, fruit bats or insects in the sky.\r\nwe had our balcony doors fully open and we would never even see a moth inside the hotel rooms.\r\ni felt excited that i had seen an unusual object(s) and that i might have captured it on film. i never checked the camera until the active cell had passed over our location. i was speaking with  my wife that i might have been lucky to capture the image and we will have to check all images on our cameras if they might have been other photos. the excitement of the objects had over taken the excitement of being so close to a massive active lightning storm.\r\nwe straight away checked the iphone when the storm had passed and even on the small screen of the phone i could see the black object. it was not until i downloaded the image on my ipad could i see the silver saucer shaped object.\r\ni then put the image onto a hd tv in the hotel room and saw the image better on screen. \r\nfor some years i have kept the image to myself and have only showed a small group of people i trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

operation iraqi freedom.  the fob (forward operating base) that we were stationed in had a large area directly to the west of the fob that contained old demolished houses that used to house the military personnel when iraqi army used to operate out of the area (fob known as fob gabe).\r\n\r\nthis housing zone had already been picked clean of all metal and anything remotely of value.  \r\n\r\ni was on site security at the time of 2315 when i first noticed a bluish light hovering above the old housing area.  at first i believed it may have been a flare or an illumination round of some sort.  i did not hear a report (from launch or ignition) that would accompany an illumination flare or round.\r\n\r\ni attempted to call in the information to my sergeant of the guard, but neither my handheld radio, nor the military radio which utilizes frequency hop fm modulation was able to make a connection to either my sog nor the battalion radio center.\r\n\r\nthe light did not flicker as a star would; it did not move - it just hung there, silent.\r\n\r\nafter between 10-15 minutes the light shot directly up into the sky and disappeared.  \r\n\r\ni placed this information in my report once my security shift ended at 0000.\r\n\r\nwhen daylight broke we went into the old housing area as a platoon and explored to ensure it was not a flare or other device being utilized by anti-us forces for communications.\r\n\r\nduring our exploration of the area we found exactly 37 dog corpses.  all dogs were female and all the dogs were mutilated in an extremely similar manner:  a small incision was placed into the stomach of the canine, but all of the internal organs of the dogs were removed.  \r\n\r\nthe official report was that it was iraqi citizens utilizing dogs for food, but i don't know of any way to remove all organs from an incision that couldn't be more than 2 inches in length.\r\n\r\nit is my belief that the light that i witnessed was a ufo.  the old housing area was known to be full of dogs (as is pretty much any city area in iraq).  i believe this event had the objective of obtaining dog organs for some purpose unknown.\r\n\r\nadditionally, there was never a single dog heard or seen in that old housing area for the rest of our deployment.\r\n\r\nthe local iraqi's claimed it is a standard practice of a djinn, which is a demon creature much like the fable of the genie.\r\n\r\nmy battalion commander interviewed me intensely based on my report and stated that i would be better off to not relay my \"conspiracy theories\" to anyone as it may have a very detrimental effect on my military career.  i have kept quiet until today.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

(sawing noise) agains each other and then i heard helicopter sounds. one can hear helicopters here often but not these ones. these wore like the melitary ones; the noise was to laud so i got up and looked thru the window and i saw a strange triangle shaped object with tree big lights (one at each end of the triangle) and then there ware lights coming and going all around the sides that change colour (blue, lilac, white, green... like rainbow effects but coming and going) and then the metal noise stopped and all i could hear was the helicopters. as i couldn't see the helicopter(s) from my bedroom window (but could hear that was more than one) i grabbed my phone and went to the balcony to see if i could have a better view. \r\nas i got to the balcony i put the video on straight away as i saw 2 helicopters following this big object (3 or 4 times bigger then one helicopter) and that is when i realise the helicopters wore different from the usual ones; these wore the big army ones. the triangle object was looking like a very big dark meal structure triangle with round hedges and was high (thickness) and the lights at the end wore large, like the ones they use in football fields in orange/red colour. and then there was this big like a dome shape in the middle that was white and bright.\r\nby the time the camera is ready on the iphone i only got a glinps of the big ufo and he vanished but as i was turning the camera to film the helicopters i caught another little light that become more brighter started like  pumping light and moving (like dancing) up and down and side ways and wile doing this it got closer and the light was brighter and changing colour between gold and white and light blue and gold again and greenish and it was like rotating and moving and staying still ... and then he just wend away so very fast with a manoeuvre that no aeroplane does. it was so very fast, it certainly wasn't there anymore.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\ni went frame by frame on this little film and is amazing what i could see from the 2nd object. unfortunately the 1st (and the bigger one, i didn't catch much but one can clearly see that that is a all together different object that one can't identify).\r\n\r\ni would love to hear your feedback.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Patterned Surface,
