recorded them. , as the 2nd orb which had shot upwards, took off then quickly disappeared into the clouds, the last two hovered together, seeming like they were communicating while they were bobbing

her waiting by the street and she point to the northwestern sky and asked me what was that up there.  at first, i said oh that's either a gaseous planet/sun that is usually up in that area but this thing was about 4 times the size of the star that would be in that area.  the round/spherical planet like object was a lot larger than the star i first thought it was.  the star is normally a pen mark in the sky and this light was about 4 times larger (even closer and very bright).  the main light was a bright white round shape which was pulsating colors off all around it, yellowish/orangish, bluish, red.  this light wasn't quite to the horizon line yet and we stood there watching it for nearly 5 minutes.  the neighbor thought that it moved a bit to the northwest but i thought that it could be the illusion of the lights being thrown off the side of it in that direction.  i asked her to take a ride up the road a bit to get into a tree clearing that we could see more of the sky in and we both went to lock our doors and head to the car and when we came out not five minutes later this thing was gone (and not passed the horizon line either).  we took a ride due west about three miles to where there are no trees and you could clearly see this round spherical object was completely gone and there were no clouds in that area blocking any light.  we did have small wispy clouds over us but you could see other stars through them and there were no thicker type clouds around.  we both also knew this wasn't a plane as it was stationary for the most part and didn't have the usual plane lights.  it also couldn't have been a satellite as they don't just stop and throw off various colored lights.  if that was a planet than it's path must've come a lot closer to earth than i've ever seen it in the past nine years.  i've been out watching this area of the sky for the past two nights and the planet i first thought it was is very small off in the distance and doesn't resemble what we saw two nights ago.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

be getting out and going home. he doesn't have a computer so he wanted me to tell his story\r\n\r\nour family had a vacation home in gulf shores,alabama. on about monday night, june 14th, 1965 the entire family looked out over the gulf of mexico and noticed three seperate groups of lights. one group of lights would gradually fade out and then re-appear on the other side of the other lights. they did this going back and forth routine for about 25 minutes. the other family members went back into the house. lawrence went down to the beach. on the way he noticed a figure in the window of a craft and then heard a voice that told him to lay down. as he was lying down his mind was receiving a message and it sounded like an audio reel to reel tape going in fast forward. as he was hearing this he was thinking,\"boy, this is going too fast\" at which time the voice said,\"don't worry, when the time is right you will understand\". after this was over, lawrence was told to stand up,which he did. the next thing he remembers is that he was walking down the road towards the beach house.At this time another voice told him that he was going to be working for his father for 12 1/2\r\nyears. lawrence thought this was crazy because our father was a doctor and lawrence was in music and playing in bands. in 1985, my fathers nurse got re-married and her new husband wouldn't let her work,so my father asked lawrence if he wanted to do it and lawrence told him that he would. lawrence worked for my father from june of 1985 until december 31st, 1997. he had worked for our father for 12 1/2 years just like the voice said.\r\n\r\nthis is just the beginning of events that have been going on now for 50 years. here's just a quick summary of events that have happened:\r\n1) 1967: strange lights observed while driving home from a concert in livingston alabama.\r\n2) 1968:destin florida- lots of lights moving just above swamp land and a voice telling him,\"everything is parallel\".\r\n3) 1969: went shooting. hit a post about 30 yards away,ricochet back to him in very slow motion, hit him and the bullet just fell to the ground.\r\n4) 1978: may 8th, 1978 an aircraft lands in escambia bay. on his way over to see it,his wife and lawrence see a strange light coming towards them. the car loses all electrical power and stops. after light passes car starts up like nothing happened.\r\n5) late 1980's: had more encounters while living in gulf breeze florida where our family had moved to in 1967. it was during this time that lawrence received another voice message:\"don't tempt the fates which lie before you,for you shall surely loose\".\r\n6) 2015: lawrence was leaving his house to run up to the store. found a design that was drawn on the hood of his car in the snow. didn't have a camera so he drew the design on paper. i wll include this drawing in a attachment when i send this information to you.\r\n\r\nlawrence has quite a story to tell and he is still able and willing to tell it. all he needs is someone that will listen. reading this does not do justice to his information. you need to hear him tell it for i have probably left out some vital information.\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me the opportunity to share this information with you. i hope someone can actually contact lawrence,sit down with him and let him tell you everything that has been happening over the past 50 years. i think you will leave with a different feeling as to what is really going on out there.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\nkeith farrior

povoado de santo antônio do rio grande, município de bocaina de minas, estado de minas gerais, br, as 11:00 da manhã,do dia 23 de setembro de 2008, quando observei uma luz muito brilhante, igual a uma estrela, a lado do sol.  me protegi em uma parede, para não olhar para o sol diretamente, e fiquei observando.  parecida parado, mas, estava se deslocando muito lentamente, como se estivesse acompanhando a rotação da terra.  observei também, o som de um jato supersônico da aeronáutica, nesse momento.   quando tirava o olho do objeto, e voltava a vê-lo, observei que se deslocava lentamente.   passou por cima de minha casa, em construção, sem laje  e, observei que o brilho continuava, apesar de observá-lo por baixo .   o brilho envolvia todo o objeto, conclusão que cheguei depois dos seguintes acontecimentos :   o objeto parou a cerca de uns 300 metros e ali ficou por cerca de uns 15 minutos .   nessa ocasião, passou uma nuvem, que estimo estar a cerca de 800 m a 1000 m de altitude e para minha surpresa o brilho do objeto sumiu e de uma forma de bola, vi nitidamente que era uma forma retangular (vista de lado), de cor cinza escuro.   a nuvem passou e novamente voltou o brilho refletivo, que agora atribui ser refletido do sol e não luz própria .  novamente, passou uma segunda nuvem e, os fatos se repetiram .   nesse instante, desci da minha casa, e chamei duas (2) testemunhas .  o sr. joaquim e a filha de uma amiga de nome jackeline .  ficamos observando e o objeto começou a se deslocar no mesmo ritimo de antes, vagarosamente, agora em uma direção de 90º , sem fazer manobras alguma, quando novamente parou a cerca de uns 400 metros.  ali permaneceu parado por uns 15 minutos e do zero, partiu com uma velocidade incrível, parecendo o arranque de um carro de corrida .  pude observar também, que antes do deslocamento repentino, momentos antes, tive a impressão que o objeto se estremeceu e de disparou em direção se .   curioso, que logo depois desse acontecimento, um famoso cantor de pagode, chamado zeca pagodinho, veia na tv e também se pronunciou ter visto um disco voador no seu local preferido,de descanso, em xerém, estado do rio de janeiro .  durante esse evento, também pude observar, um avião da fab passar 5 vezes no local, dando a entender que já estava em perseguição ao objeto e, por isso, ele parou sob o sol , para não poder ser enxergando pelo piloto .  essa observação, do jato supersônico,foi feita pela audição, já que foi impossível vê-lo passando e possivelmente estava muito alto e por cima das nuvens .   o objeto estava na alturas das nuvens . anexo a foto do povoado onde foi feita a observação .","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:40:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

kansas about 2 miles south of highway 36. my 2 children were about 5 and 6 years old at the time.   we were coming out of the house facing south and saw a very bright light coming from the south not very high in the sky.  it skimmed over the people's house that lived across the road but they were an elderly couple and i'm sure they were probably in bed at the time.  i did not ask them about it either.   i'm guessing at the time and date of this incident because i did not write anything down about it. the ufo came right directly for us and we stood and watched as it moved over us very slowly.  this round object had lights around the middle. i'm not sure what the diameter was but i'm guessing about 28 feet. it just skimmed the top of the house just missing the tv antenna so it was very close to us.   it did not make a whisper of a sound and the dog did not appear to see it or hear it as he did not move.  we were all in awe and said nothing until it was behind the house and out of sight.  my husband, kids and i jumped into our vehicle and drove quickly around the house and up the dirt round behind the house.  the object was gone, just poof - like it was never there.   we never did talk about it and i don't even remember why.  i suppose back then we thought people would think we were crazy and of course back then the video cameras and phones were not anything that people had and no one carried a camera around with them all the time.  we did not even talk about it between ourselves that i remember but i know i had told my parents.  i watch the history channel with the ufo sightings and this is when it all came back to me.   i ask my oldest child if she remembered and she did not.   my husband and i are divorced and have been since 1985 so i of course do not ask him. in 1978 my in-laws moved to the town of kensington and we moved to the farm.  i was never afraid to be there alone.   my family always liked to lay out in lawn chairs at night in the yard to watch the stars and watch for ufo's but we never did see anything ever again. to this day i believe what we saw was an alien craft and after hearing people talk about their experiences i realize that mine is so similar in the fact that maybe the aliens did something to ensure that we did not talk about it nor were we afraid. my in-laws and my parents are all deceased now.  i guess unless my ex-husband remembers i'm the only one that remembers that incident.   my husband still lives on that farm.  his name is dennis (deke) beckmann and is about 65 years old.  his wife's name is tracy.   i'm 62.
