calgary. when i came to road 797 and 212 this is when i saw two lights at 7 o'clock and 2 o'clock above the mountains. the sun was below the horizon. the sky was clear. i have never seen these lights in this part of the sky before.The lights were getting bright but not to bright. the first thing that came to mind was jet planes, but they did not move. i stopped to get a better look. i got out of the vehicle, looked up and they were gone. i was quite disappointed. got back in the vehicle, and started to drive again. suddenly to the right about 5 mountain tops over to the right the lights came on again but very bright. i pulled over got out of the vehicle. the lights started to get so bright it was as though they were getting closer. now the lights where in the same position as the first two. i turned on my phone camera and zoomed in, and as bright as the two lights where they would not show up on the screen even as a small bright light. they did not acted like satellites. and they most certainly were not planes. the lights went out as fast as they came on. it made me feel like yes we are still here watching over everything that is going on down there. this is not the only time that i have seen strange things in the skies.  i have been seeing quite a number of strange thing over and around calgary skies  in the last number of years. seems like it is happening a lot more these days.","distance":"Over One

area of the city lights and the eve of my roof which is about 55'. i have observed this type of object on past occasions beginning in sept of 2009 on my deck in las vegas nv. this appeared to be the

the lv event with a high powered 35 mm and i knew what i was seeing. i did not have any video so decided to shoot it for a short time. the object appears to be in the low atmosphere and pulsates as as a star flickers. as you watch it the object also moves in random ways and if i were to try and describe it almost like jumping. it jumps at light speed and appeared to stay about in the same general spot on the horizon. i used the iphone compass and observed the direction initially as 121' se and when it went above the eves it was at 126' se. i have seen this type object in pc before but it was

catching up as we'd not seen each other for a few weeks, after a while i went outside to smoke a cigarette. i lit my cigarette and sat down in a chair in his back yard.\r\n\r\nas i looked up at the sky in front of me i saw the flashing lights of a passenger plane that looked like it was on the landing approach to liverpool john lennon airport, flying in from left to right (east to west), this is more than 20 miles away from my location in westhoughton. as i watched the plane on its approach i noticed a flash of light above my head over 500 ft above and slightly to the left of me, this light immediately went from its position heading south at speed that i have never witnessed in my life. the flight path was direct from north to south and flew pretty close to the rear of the plane in view, as the light left my view i noticed another flash of light above and to the left of me only a little to the right from where the first light appeared, that object then took the same path as the first and seemed to fly over the landing plane and at the same speed as the last light.\r\n\r\nall this happened in less than 2 seconds and in complete silence. i was so excited i lept from my seat and started to shout my friend who was inside his house talking to another friend, i could see him trough his window and he was less than 8 ft from my location. i shouted him about 3 times as loud as i dared without upsetting the neighbours, but he never heard my calls. i only lost sight of the objects because of the speed they were doing they hit the horizon in a split second.\r\n\r\nthis is not my first sighting of these types of craft but was the most exiting that's the reason for me to share this with you guys. i have seen them in the daytime where i live in westhoughton, they were both spherical silver objects probably the size  of a minivan, i have also seen them on 2 occasions whilst on holiday in egypt and have seen them at night time leaving the atmosphere. but last night was by far the most exciting experience i have ever had, and look forward to many more.\r\n\r\nthanx for reading.","distance":"Over One
