States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hello id like to share some of my strange experiences that occurred in my small hometown in northeastern pennsylvania. maybe you can shed some light on whats been going on. ever since i was a young child, 5-6, ive been interested in the otherworldly. my sister would tell me i would shut my parents and siblings out. she said id never talk much to anyone, only to the point where i had to. she said i always thought that my parents were not related to me. she exclaimed that i drew constantly, drawing the night sky. she said it got to a point where i drew what looked like to be tall grey aliens, some shorter, some different colors. much of my childhood i cant remember myself but when moving into a different house i found the note pad that contained some of my drawings depicting exactly what my sister was talking about. aliens. aircraft. portraits of the stars. i also had strange dreams, dreams without a visual texture, but with the feeling of fear..And what i can only describe as a intense gravitational pull, much like those spinning rides at amusement parks that spin and keep you against the wall with centrifugal force but much more powerful. fast forward years later as a teenager. i don't take as much interest in the otherworldly as i did as a child, i'm more focused on girls, school and other social gatherings. but the strange dreams still occurred. this time with more visual stimuli. dreams of myself standing in my front lawn..The sky is dark with an orange tint. triangular crafts, many as far as the eye can see. then i look back to the lawn where a jet black being, tall..7 to 8 feet with mirror like eyes. i didn't feel any fear as it began to lift its arm and palm extended towards my face in the same way a construction worker motioning cars to stop. after that i woke up confused because of the realism i just experienced in the dream. this dream recurred. never getting any further than the being raising his hand. i had many other dreams with different themes but all relating back to them. whatever they are. a wild imagination? i didn't know.Then in 2013 when i was 16 i saw something very strange. it was around 11pm or 12 am..In july around independence day. i was riding my bike to my highschool, a mile away from my house, out of boredom and not wanting to be around my intoxicated family members. a quarter mile away from my house at a four way intersection is where i saw it. it seemed to come out of no where and it was right above me at a height of about 200feet. it was a silient glowing reddish orange ball. around the size of what i explain as if you picked the sun out of the sky as we see from our point of view on earth  and \"copy and pasted\" it right above my head. it was bright but not to a point were it hurt the eyes. it seemed to just hover there for a long time while i blankly stared it for some time. im not sure how long i stood there staring but i felt calm, almost hypnotized by whatever it was. before i knew it, it began to slowly  turn and make its way down the road. i just stared at it when it finally hit me that i just saw this.. i put my foot on the pedals of my bike trying to follow it. it started to pick up speed and elevation and just zoomed away at staggering speeds. almost like it blinked out of existence. i went back home and told no one of what i saw. a year later.. i begin to notice more lights around the skies of my house. some exactly like the glowing orb but at further distances. some that strobe an array of colors. now i am aware of what jets, commercial airplanes, drones and other known air vehicles exterior night lights look like and none of these orbs were like it.None of these orbs looked like that. they performed maneuvers that aren't at all typical of any known craft, their speed and quick turns were amazing. since then i haven't seen much in the skys but strange things still do happen. such as a night while i was at my house alone in january of last year. i was in my living room trying to watch tv when i began to get an uneasy feeling. i felt a vibration reverberating throughout the house originating from something outside of the house to the left of my position. it was a quick pulsation of low tone vibrations that i could hear from outside but also feel in my body and in my head. it struck a raw feeling of fear into me.. making me stay there on the couch. i wanted to go outside to see what it was but the fear kept me back. it lasted about a minute or less but felt like an  hour. i don't know how to explain these things, im an open book, so i will appreciate any input you have. thank you. \r\n\r\n sincerely, austin","distance":"101-500

interaction between you and the object?  yes… magnetometer alarm sounding before sighting. \r\n\r\non the night of the january 12th 2014 christian mcgailey and i went to work as usual between 6-6.30pm the same as any other day.\r\nwe were working as industrial cleaners at the time where we travel between destinations during the day and this one is our last job of the day but cannot enter the building before 6pm. we get into the building and the first thing we always did was grab a coffee because there was a free vend machine in the canteen. so while we are drinking our coffee and i am showing chris a new app i have from dr.Steven greer called the et contact tool. i played a few tones from the app and then went onto the meditation part and i believe we listened to this all the way through, while looking at the instruments part with my phone on the table!! the alarm on the magnetometer sounds & we both look at each other and say something like there is something here if it’s going off. i picked up my phone and took a screen shot before it stopped! so after being a little freaked out that the app is either working or just faulty i didn’t know what to think!! we both say roughly the same time that lets get out of here. so we make our way out to the fire exit for a cigarette before we start work. we are still talking about what just happened and the alarm sounding and this is about 8pm-8:10pm when all of a sudden i believe it was the chilling silence that made us look up and there is this v shaped craft floating silently over our heads. i remember turning to chris and saying something like are you seeing this wtf is that? feeling completely calm and mesmerized that the craft was so close i could have jumped up and touched it! now before the craft came so close to us there were birds singing / water running to our right, the sound of wind moving through the trees and various noise from the hotel to the left about 100 yards or so & then total silence as if all sound had just been muted or switched off. it felt like there was static from the craft and i felt like everything was going in slow motion because i specifically remember stepping forward to the front of the steps on the top of the stairwell and inspecting the craft as if it was stood still and saying out laud to chris it’s too clean cut and silent to be anything else apart from a ufo? it looked like it just came from a mould. no rivets no seems no engines nothing familiar to anything man made!! it had a surface like black glass or water like and from what i could see i believe we could see the stars straight through the craft. i have never in my life seen lights like those on this craft still today. everything on the craft was too perfect including the 5 white lights i can only describe as the brightest white you can possibly imagine! when the craft was fully visible to us there was a bright red (orb) point of light in the centre of the v floating along with the craft and by this time my brain cannot calculate what’s going on but i know what i am seeing and feeling because we can feel the heat from the lights and i called out again to chris are you seeing this? (i say called out because it felt like we had to! like we were in some sort of field of energy) and i said it looks like its flying backwards because it’s flying points first!! but the orb is not connected to the craft omg!!\r\nwe are still talking about the craft while it is gliding silently away to our left, straight towards the back of the hotel about 150yd away and then i turn again to chris to my right and say i can’t believe what we are seeing and turn back too look at the craft again and it has either disappeared /dematerialized or accelerated to an unbelievable speed. we both turn round and go back into the building very confused as to what just happened and only just realizing we didn’t even make an attempt in taking a picture! it felt like we were incapable of doing so!! we are just walking towards the canteen again to start work when chris stopped me and said do you realize the time? i said no that’s the last thing i would care about mate not after what we’ve just seen; we then realized that more time has passed than we thought! it’s is now way past 10pm and i don’t understand?? we didn’t get out of there till gone 1am and the job only takes roughly 2 hours??\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":70352,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":50.9194183,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-09102015-0026","longitude":-1.2929578,"occurred":1389557400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1441908592000,"summary":"100ft v shaped ufo glides silently over our heads at less than 10 feet.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"SO30 2AF ","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":605,"locationName":"Hedge End","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8105"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Koenigstein Taunus ","country":"DE","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was x-mas eve in germany and i went to pick-up my grandmother in a village close to the event. light snowfall and almost no traffic on the road, we went to join the rest of the family in a castle style restaurant in kronberg taunus. between the villages koenigstein and kronberg is a elongated road with a scenic view onto frankfurt. very spectacular and especially with all its lights, it creates its own glow from that viewpoint. with the goal to not worry my grandmother with driving to fast, we took it slow... very slow. and as we are reaching the view point with about 30 km/h, there is this massive object above our head in a very slow speed gliding towards frankfurt. \r\nthis was no disk or boomerang; it was a massive bulky shape, dark, no lights and very clear the edges with the backlight from frankfurt city.\r\nwe stopped right there on the road and i noticed a police car about 200 ft behind us and them too leaving their car to follow the object.\r\nnot the minor sound or blimp, just gliding. and before it would fly over the city, it turned right and disappeared behind a mountain line.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":70351,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"DE-09102015-0025","longitude":null,"occurred":693532800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1441905960000,"summary":"A massive object flying towards frankfurt. so close and no sound. police stopped behind me to witness the event.

my new canon 60d dslr camera using a canon 75mm-300mm zoom lens, i have a wonderful view from my balcony of melbourne city which is south of my location.\r\n\r\nat this time i noticed (at first glance) what appeared to be a helicopter, it was flying in a northerly direction over the city, it was a fair distance away from me when i first noticed it (the city is about 15 kilometers away from my location) and all i could see was a tiny red light, at first i thought it was the police or news helicopter as they usually fly over that area.\r\n\r\ni observed this object through my cameras view finder trying to find the correct camera settings, and as i zoomed in i noticed 3 solid red lights and one solid greenish/white light (very unusual on any known flying vehicle that i'm aware of), airplanes i know have 3 lights (red and green solid lights and the solid white head light and a tail white light which strobes) and i knew the police helicopter has a solid bright white head light and a white strobe tail light and red and blue lights, so finding 3 solid red light (which at times pulsated to a bright yellowy orange) and a solid greenish light got my attention right away, it was then i got all excited and thought (what the heck is this thing?).\r\n\r\ni have had a few ufo sightings over the past 25 years and i have been trying to capture them ever since i got this new dslr camera, you can say im kind of a part time ufo spotter now, anyhow as it flew over the city heading north it changed course to a easterly direction and traveled a distance of around 2 or 3 kilometers until it reached as far as the mcg (the melbourne cricket ground) and then turned to travel north again (directly towards my direction), that's when i thought \"oh you beauty!\" now i will find out what this thing is, but it traveled to around the thornbury suburb which is about 3 kilometers from me and stopped still, and it kinda hovered in that one spot rotating, then it started flying/hovering around in a small circle (around a 50 meter in diameter circle), when soon after another identical craft came from the east and met up with this first craft, it was amazing! they met up and kind of fly around each other in a big circle, and at times they got very close and at times very far from each other, but did not contact each other (as far as i saw), and after about 2 minutes one headed off (slowly) in a easterly direction and the other followed right after it.\r\n\r\nluckily i had my new canon dslr all ready to go and i was taking shots like there was no tomorrow, i am new to photography and i still have lots to learn, and as any professional photographer will tell you, taking night shot of flying craft as a very long distance is one of the hardest shots to capture, i think i took about 200 photos and a small video clip, i still have all the original photos within my flickr web page and i spent about 6 hours finding a lot of photos that i think came out best and than cropped them and saved them into smaller files (as the original files are huge jpeg's of around 5 mega-bites each), these photos are half the original size and i used a zoom factor of between 250x to 600x times magnification for the crops, i will try and locate the video clip i took but i think its lost due to a computer crash, if i find them i will surely add them here if possible.\r\n\r\ni wish i could add all the photos here but i'm only allowed to add 10 pictures :( so i just loaded at random, if anyone would like to view my flickr page and view all the photos i took from this sighting please feel free to go here: [link moved to fi section/cms/tg]\r\n\r\nthe first ufo was spotted by other ufo spotters not far from me and was recorded on a couple of facebook ufo groups, so this sighting was witnessed by others, i was told by another ufo spotter that these red light craft are regular visitors to melbourne.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading my
