very rapid speed almost straight up in the air. my sceptical girlfriend was flabbergasted and worried.\r\n\r\none month later in mid august, att my home in lower paxton township, myself, my girlfriend and two friends were outside trying to spot some luck from the meteor shower. we were relaxing and conversing on a beautiful evening. my friend says he has been looking at a star for 5 minutes and all of a sudden it started moving slowly so we should look up. we all four observed it move slowly across the sky. i kept remarking how bright it was and the fact that it was not blinking whatsoever. i thought for safety reasons aircraft needed to blink. after about three minutes of it moving slowly in one direction, it made a 90 degree turn(on a dime) and sped off quickly in that direction. i am

it, when  i flashed a mag light on it, it came towards me and hovered overhead.\r\ni had seen this star five nights in a row and it seemed to have red, blue and yellow colors to it. it didn't move in the sky like a normal star. it had seemed to be stationary over bracket field. it seemed to be about 5 miles high when i flashed the flashlight at it. it descended in a straight ling and then moved in a straight line towards me, dropped again and hovered over me. it was partly cloudy that night but we had a bright moon. it was 350' long, and looked like the fuselage of an airplane. it had a tail like a 737 and little wings on both sides towards the middle. it appeared to be fragile, and had lines on it like a zeppelin. it was a golden burnished bronze color. after 15 minutes it returned to its original place over bracket field. it moved in a straight line path and then ascended upward and moved in a straight line path until it was in its original position. \r\nthe next night, in the

it, about 5 white lights. it goes upward about 1,000' and turns, i can see 15 led bright blue lights on the very back of the craft. it made a low rumbling sound as it warped away.\r\ni know it has

sometimes we have planes or heliocopters flying in that direction.  suddenly began observing an object that remained in one area of the sky and at first thought it might be a plane in a holding position, but it is not near any airport.  it continued to remain there and then another object suddenly appeared below it and slowly  rose toward it, hovered for a few minutes and disappeared abruptly.  neither were airplanes or heliocopters as i grew up around aircraft with my father owning airplanes.  i have also studied astronomy at the university of oregon.  these objects did not fit into any known classification that i know.  the lights were brilliant.  i looked through bionoculars that i ran into the house and got.  just as i adjusted them and spotted the main object that had appeared first and had remained when the second one left i could quickly see that is was round with a lighted dome on top which was filled with yellow light.  as soon as i saw it, it disppeared.  three weeks before this time a very large craft flew overhead filling the sky that my husband saw coming home from work at 2:27 a.M. on a wednesday three weeks before this sighting.  i was asleep but woke to lights rotating around my front yard.  i thought they were car lights although none had ever shown through my yard like that.  i stayed in bed unfortlunately as my husband saw the object from his car and said it filled the sky, was round with lights all around it like fog lights.  the moon was full that night and i asked him where he saw it as i knew where the moon was positioned at that hour and he kept sawing the moon was orange but it was not.  it would have been white.  one week later someone reported to our small paper that they had seen an orange object and wandered if anyone else had seen thus assuring that my husband had seen something.  the night of my sighting he said he saw the object again.  he wouldn't give me any details as he insists it must be military.  most usually say this as they cannot accept the possibility of an actual ufo.  i have had two other sightings in my life many years back.  i never believed until i had one.  the first one was in may of 1973 between homedale, id and jordan valley, or and someone reported it in vale, or.  there was a time loss in that sighting for me and a large, round burn mark appeared later on the inside of my left forearm.  the doctor did not know what it was.  i was somewhat fearful for sometime afterward.  i never reported it.  the other was in florida in 1989 summertime and there were a lot of sightings going on and friends wanted me to go watch them and i refused.  i was working in a restaurant called 'the yearling' at cross creek, florida when the electric shut off just as i was leaving work.  i went outside to get into my pickup and noticed only that side of the road was without electric.  just as i was driving down the road an object thirty to forty feet above the ground slowly moved overhead following the road.  it had three red lights behind it and made no sound.  i kept driving and watching until it stopped over a dense area of woods where i saw a large red glow.  i stopped the truck for a while, but thought i had better not go any closer so i left and went home as i wanted nothing to do with it.  i have never reported these two incidents as who would take me seriously?  i only know that i was a disbeliver before my first observation.  thank you for listening to me.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was a clear day with bright sunshine, and in the middle of the afternoon. i was ten years of age. my parents were in a shoe store in bennington, vermont. i was outside of the store with a young woman that was a friend of the family. we were alone together, and there was no one else in the area. we were talking to one another, and then both of us turned to notice a dark metallic disc with a dome protrusion on the top that was hovering about five hundred feet away. it was about thirty feet across. it hovered there about forty feet off of the ground. there was no sound emanating from the object. we both were enthusiastic about what we were seeing, and there was no doubt that this was an unidentified flying object. after watching the disc for about one minute, i told the young woman that was with me to go into the store, and to tell everyone to come out and see this. the disc proceeded directly towards me, hovered for a moment, and then exited the sky to my left in a non-ballistic motion. no one else was a witness to this event besides this young woman and myself. by the time that the other people in the store came outside, it was gone. my father was engaged in classified government research on psychic phenomenon at the association for research and enlightenment, and was the author of several books on the subject. i have seen the side of classified government research on extraterrestrial visitation that the majority of people are not aware of. if one becomes too proficient in the research on the psychic transfer of thought processes, mental telepathy, there is a welcoming committee of classified information safeguards. unfortunately, this is also inclusive of threats of lethal force to remain silent. the research by the government to assemble the database of people that have seen unidentified flying objects is why i waited so long before initiating a report. the security mandates are overwhelming, and i have ended up a destroyed man. the specificity in conscious memory in detail of the event is difficult to come by. this seems to have happened as a means of terminating my credibility to communicate my experiences that would be outside of the regulation to control disclosures by the government personnel that are in a purported authorized capacity. in the year of nineteen eighty four, i was made destitute by members of my family. i ended up in the state of hawaii under duress without recourse. after having been to hawaii island for about two weeks, one night i was in a field next to hilo international airport. three dirigibles appeared overhead, and were surrounded by a mist. this was likely liquid nitrogen. this had to have been given formal clearance with the airport administration, as the event was in the airspace. one of the dirigibles lightly collided with one of the others, and then they drifted away out of view. there has been a multi-million dollar expense to try to confuse the issue with me about the vermont incident. i was supposed to attribute this to my personal worth, and it became clear to me of the attempt to develop a systematic process instead. after recently reading a fraudulent newspaper article 'mass sightings of ufo's over the skies of mexico', the elaborate conspiracy to control the credibility of a witness began to become a reasonable cause to suspect. there are some people of wealth that feel wrongfully excluded from inclusion in the activities of these alien beings. this has escalated into making an example out of anyone that has seen a genuine unidentified flying object at a personal discretion. ensuring the safeguards has become a means to an end to use witnesses as a form of a classified leverage to obtain a vertical influence from within an intelligence agency. this now extends to any manner of a personal disclosure that is external to the accepted channels, and i do not think that the majority of people are aware of this type of jeopardy. maintaining secrecy can be a good thing in the protection of the integrity of information or specific identity, but i am of the persuasion that it is costing innocent people their very lives instead: trust is being violated. alien visitation always has a purpose to it. the greatest leverage against the exceptional harassment for having seen a u.F.O. is the public awareness that would terminate the ulterior influence that is responsible for it. a loss of respect from a public disdain would disarm the interest to censure witnesses to continue. i suspect that there are quite a few people that have been hopelessly confused as to why they have become subjected to threats, and this terminates a desire to be further involved. this is the tactic that is being used towards the objective to restrict access. the more that people can be made to be confused as to how to approach this in turn makes an organized resistance more difficult to actualize. it is a vicious circle of a self reinforcing justification to prevent an organized objective counterpoint. a system of authority should welcome the checks and balances to ensure the integrity involved, and not make examples out of innocent people for trying. it is up to each person to determine the implications of this.","distance":"101-500

got stronger and i found that odd, i went and put my glasses on to take get a better look, it was much clearer that this was not a firework but more like a beacon, the only problem with that was there are no beacons that i have ever seen around here and the nearest airport is ten miles not to mention we hardly ever get any air traffic over here. i got my lower power binoculars and got a better glimpse, at one point it seemed like it was reflecting the glow below it, it started to get foggy. i went inside to get my cell phone to record it, when i came back it was still there, we both saw it, but it was too far and to weak to show up on the the cell camera. it also appeared to have moved to out left somewhat visible between trees, we both saw two glowing lights side by side separated by what would be about 4 fingers from out distance, the lights looked like to glowing red beady eyes to us it was very eerie and left us with a very uneasy feeling,we continued to try to observe it, but we lost sight of it.  i turned on the police scanner to see if there were any reports of anything unusual in the sky but there was not, the whole sighting lasted roughly about 8 mins. hopefully

non moving white light in the sky. it wasn't flashing at all. it was not moving in any direction. there was no sound of any kind. to the right i could see the moon,some stars and the sky was clear.\r\n\r\ni took a video. when i started it, it was dark then as you can see in this clip, the sun's coming up which makes the light a bit clearer. there was no doubt that something was just sitting there. i also took a picture and when i enlarge it it looks weird it's not so round as it looks from afar. it was almost bean shape but i do understand there was distortion in the enlargement.This is co-op city.The view in the video is of the neighboring buildings,park and bridge into city island. nothing but water after that. you can see the flashing lights from the bridge on the right side of the video. so i believe it looks like it was hovering over the water. \r\n\r\nafter about 15 min i went to bed. there's nothing i could do. what's weird is i always see planes passing to land in queens every few minutes. during this time no planes crossed. coming or going. \r\n\r\ni wouldn't have said anything but later that evening i saw a post a facebook friend posted up

my wife noticed something very strange.  she asked \"what is that\" and then proceeded to run into the house because she was scared!  i looked up in the sky and saw a red amber glow at a very far distance flyng through the sky at a high rate of speed.  this object looked as if it had 2 main lights but had a blurry look to it.  the shape reminded me of a pyramid or of a boomerang.   the object had shape unlike any  of the the regular night objects that move through the sky.  it was the most amazing thing i have ever seen in the sky!  it moved so fast through the sky you could tell it was nothing of this earth!  while i observed this object it reminded me of a huge bird but no bird ( based on spherical shape of obeject) i know glowed likes this did!  i hope other s saw this as well because it was the best evidence i have seen of a ufo in my lifetime.
