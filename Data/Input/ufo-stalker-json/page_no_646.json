something outside of the frame of my glasses, so i moved my head to see what it was.  it was then i saw 6 very dimly lit reddish/orange lights all moving quickly in unison in the shape of a v.  there was absolutely no sound.  it was almost like the individual lights were on a single object because they were moving perfectly together.  i can't recall if the object was solid, or appeared transparent.  i tried to grab my cell phone to record it, but by the time i got the camera app opened, the object was gone.  this was the first time i had every witnessed anything like this.  i've

assigned to minot afb in 1985, and was a capt on a b-52 crew when i separated in  1990. i was returning to visit friends and family in 1992. what i witnessed was in fairly under-populated area on a stretch of hwy 2/52 that had about an 8 to 10 mile visual shot of the horizon to the west due to terrain. i had not seen oncoming or trailing traffic in sometime. the road is a 2 lane blacktop running parallel to a set of active railroad tracks. i noticed an extremely brilliant light cresting the horizon. my immediate thought was oncoming train. i took notice shortly after my initial sighting and thought it was moving at and unusually high speed. shortly after that i could discern the horizon line was below it. i decided to stop my vehicle and try to determine what this was. i pulled to the shoulder of the road and exited my car. i couldn't believe the rate of speed this object was moving. the single bright light was the only thing i could see. my estimates of his speed are 600 to 800 kts. i felt the need to move behind my vehicle. the tracks were approx 100 yds from the road. it went by me with no change in altitude or direction. the vehicle stayed directly over the rail tracks during my observation. as it passed, the bright light was no longer visible, but multiple round multi colored random pulsing light came into view. there may have been 5 or 6 of these lights pulsating different colors. this looked to be the propulsion of the craft. the most unexplained part of my experience was the fact that no sound was ever made. i watched until it disappeared over the east horizon. i was shocked. i completed my drive to minot and to this day am trying to understand what i saw. i finished my flying career as an 747 instructor with delta airlines and retired in 2012. in my military and civilian flying careers, i have not seen anything else that i could not explain. this event i cannot. i was curious if anyone else saw this or anything similar.","distance":"101-500

if i went outside amd looked. i would see a ufo. i thought it strange how i was so sure i would see something.\r\n  it was a normal thing for me to go up on the flat roof of my home for a cigarette and the amazing view we had there. i remember as i was walking out, i thought i should grab my phone or camera. but i had the feeling that i shouldn't because then i would see nothing, or it would be a negative thing for me to do so. it was odd but i knew these things. i knew 100% that it was there, from the first thoughts in my kitchen. to walking out the back deck, and up the ladder onto the roof. \r\noff the top of the ladder, i had 30 feet to walk on the flat roof to the spot where i usually smoked and took in the view. so i decided to walk out looking forward and not looking up at what i was strangly certain was there. also i thought i'd better light my cigarette before looking up. after lighting up i took a breath and looked directly above me to see a stationery silver disc or sphere 1000 feet or so up. literally, directly above my home. incredibly i was not suprised at all, and there became a feeling of it not being a big deal at all. i watched it for 15 minutes or so hovering.\r\n  there was some typical utah summertime  cumulo/thunderhead clouds in the sky near the object. because of that, i believe i got a good perspective on the silvery sphere. it was definitely a solid object, hanging halfway down from the top of the tall dynamic looking cloud. blue sky behind and around the object. tall fluffy cloud to its right side. \r\nthe feeling in me, of it being not a big deal at all was so strong. i said goodbye mentally to it and left the roof. even though it was still up there!\r\n   after i got down to my bedroom. i thought i should get my phone and go back up for a photo because my dad may think i am crazy when i tell him later that day. although the feeling that i knew it would be gone was there. i went back up to see. the cloud had moved into the spot where the object was before. there was nothing to see or photo. and i felt dumb for ignoring my thoughts and even trying to get a picture.\r\nthe sighting itself was not was impacted me. i feel like the importance of my experience is in the fact i felt compelled to go outside and see what somehow i knew was there. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

hours and i noticed way ahead of me flashing lights. it appeared to be a patrol car as if someone had been pulled over. as i got closer i could see that it was not on the road, but up in the air near the wave 3 television tower. i rolled down my car window as i drove further and when i reached the tower i stuck my head out of the window and tried to look upward at the object hovering right next to the tower about 100 ft above me right beside the road. there was a car behind me and i slowed way down but did not want to stop in the middle of the road. i turned right on hwy 53 about 1/4 mi or less up the road and drove toward la grange so that i could turn around to go back. there is a street right off the hwy on the right i turned on, to turn around. i took the next immediate left and put my car in reverse and backed up. as i was backing up i was looking over my right shoulder and noticed that the object was now very low to the ground and moving slowly through the trees across the same road. it moved slowly toward la grange. i panicked and thought o m g ! it noticed me looking at it and it descended to my level and was following me ! so i put my car in drive pretty fast and took off. i immediately turned right and drove toward la grange in the same direction as the object. i could have driven about a mile up the road and  turned right on fendley mill rd. and driven about 500

ridiculed by my family after i got home that night so didnt bother reporting it.  i was 12 at the time and i am now 27 and this, to this day, bugs me as i really want to know what it was.  i know its such a cliche, but i know what i saw.\r\n\r\nit was around the back end of summer, year 2000 and i had been to a birthday party up easington lane with my best friend callum. being 12 years old it was a sober party, no alcohol and most definitely no drugs. \r\n\r\nafter the party, my friend got offered a lift home so left me to walk home by myself (typical- how i wish he too witnessed what i did) on my way home i had to pass through a private housing estate and in the middle of this estate theres a small green area, complete with a half dozen large trees. \r\n\r\nas i walked through this area something in the sky caught my eye and i immediately looked up. there in the sky was a large rocket shaped craft. it had an orange glow right around it, with a green glow encapsulating the orange glow. it made no noise and travelled slowly through the sky in a nw direction. it was very large however i couldnt say exactly how large. it didnt seem very high in the sky but again i wouldn't be able to say exactly how high.  i managed to get a good look at it for around 4-5 seconds before it disappeared over a house.  at that point i ran quickly around the house to get another look at it, which took me all of a couple of seconds, however it was gone.\r\n\r\nmy initial thought was nasa, as it was obviously not an aeroplane. then it instantly dawned on me that there is no way nasa would have rocket shaped craft in this part of the world. instantly i knew id seen a ufo. my heart began racing and i got so excited (and disappointed callum wasnt there to witness it too) and i ran all the way home (about another half mile) to tell my family what i saw.\r\n\r\nwhen i told them, they laughed it off and ridiculed me. i was so frustrated. \r\n\r\nconsidering how big it was and how bright, i thought there must have been other witnesses' however i found nothing in the local papers around that time and nothing on the net. for years i have searched the internet for people reporting similar sightings in other parts of the world and i havnt found many. infact i have found none that describe exactly the same thing, and subsequently i have a huge interest in ufo's and aliens now. \r\n\r\none interesting point i found out a few years ago, thanks to the film \"the 4th kind\" is that the sumerians left images of apollo shaped craft (exactly like what i saw) in their ancient carvings. i found this very intriguing and admittedly a tad exciting. \r\n\r\nthe thought of alien beings visiting our earth doesnt bother me at all. i think its ignorant to believe that we are the only intelligent life in the entire universe. \r\n\r\ni dont tell just anybody about my experience, just certain people. some believe me and some dont. but like i say to them all, i dont care who believes me and who doesnt as i know what i saw. \r\n\r\nid really appreciate it if you could give me any more information on what i saw and/or if others have reported anything similar. \r\n\r\nmy apologies for not reporting this sooner but i assure you this is not a hoax and i really hope you could offer me some insight.\r\n\r\nthank you very much for taking your time to read this. i really hope i hear from yous. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

hammock out by where our fire had been before it burned out, while my friend was sleeping in the passenger seat of my pickup. i was awoken from a deep sleep already looking in the direction of a bright silvery-white colored orb in the sky which proceeded to break off into more lights that were smaller and marigold in color and began making a semi-vertical line in the sky. i do not know what made me wake up to the lights, but i found out the next morning that my friend woke up already looking at the lights as well and he recalled not knowing what made him wake up either. the lights continued to make shapes in the sky, (circle, triangle, more vertical lines) and periodically the marigold orbs would collect back into the single bright, bigger, and silvery-white colored orb which would descend into the trees and move up and down and horizontal in the trees all while hovering around 4-5 feet off the ground. then would rapidly ascend back into the sky splitting back into smaller marigold colored orbs that would return to making shapes.  i continued to watch this for roughly 30 min or so and fell back asleep.  i was awoken a second time from a deep sleep roughly 2 hours later already already facing the direction of the same lights in the sky in the smaller marigold colored orbs in a vertical line in the sky. they made a few more shapes that i could roughly make out through the trees when the smaller orbs collected once more into the bigger, brighter orb which would descend into the trees move around and ascend back into the sky to make shapes again. this time i watched the orb light show for roughly 45 min or so when the orb one last time descended into the trees but this time meandered through coming closer to our camp and eventually stopped around 80-100 yards at the end of the old path near the log splitter and hovered (slightly wobbling in place with a glowing white aura) around 4-5 feet off the ground. it was close enough that the trees next to my hammock were flickering with light. the orb continued to hover in this location for a few more min when it shot like a bullet back to where it had previously been earlier in the trees, moved around a bit and ascended back into the sky rapidly split off into smaller marigold colored orbs and began making the same shapes in the sky. i continued to watch this till i fell asleep a second time. i was awoken a third time to a pack of coyotes which sounded to be in the general area of where the orb had been. the coyotes were howling when they got very aggressive sounding and i heard an animal sound which i have never heard in my life. it sounded close to a scream/howl but unlike any human or animal. i am an avid outdoorsman and have never heard any animal like this (especially in kansas). almost instantly after the scream/howl i heard a few of the coyotes started to whimper like a wounded dog would. after a second scream from the unknown animal there were only yelps of pain from the coyotes, a few seconds later pure silence. that was the end to any orbs or strange sounds i heard that night. once i fell back asleep i was not awoken again till the morning. my friend later confirmed seeing everything i saw that previous night. he did not hear the scream from strange animal or the yelping hurt coyotes but he did sleep inside the truck.","distance":"21-100

since it was a pretty clear night out. we live in a pretty residential area, but it was nice and dark outside that night. we took a truck out in the field next to our house and positioned it so it was facing west, and then layed down on the hood of his truck with our backs to the windshield, so we could clearly see the sky. we noticed airplanes at first and saw a couple shooting stars as well, and what we also believed to be a satellite, so we were pretty excited at the activity we were seeing. probably 40 minutes had passed and the sky had been dark for a while without any planes flying across when all of a sudden an abnormally bright light appeared very high in the sky so that we were almost looking straight up. it was star-like; however, i am 22 and have never ever seen a star that bright. my boyfriend and i both exclaimed and asked one another if we were seeing the same thing without taking our eyes off of the light. the light continued to get brighter and then started to slowly move to the left. as it was moving to the left, the light started to diminish. my boyfriend looked at me bewildered but i kept my eyes on it, and by the time he looked back he couldn't see it anymore. but i still had my eyes on it and it was so faint i almost couldn't see it anymore, when all of a sudden with acceleration i've never seen an almost stationary object have, it zoomed off to the left and disappeared. i had goosebumps all over my body (writing this out i have goosebumps as well). my boyfriend had goosebumps also and we were both pretty shaken up over what we had just seen, because neither or us had ever seen anything like it. i had an eerie feeling watching it and an even more eerie feeling after watching it disappear. it didnt feel like a natural occurrence of

approximately middle of august 2013.  while taking a break to smoke a cigarette, we both noticed the presidential airplane flying overhead.  the president was in town to do fund raising that week.  while the aircraft was ascending, to its (and mine) left, a strange boomerang aircraft was approaching the presidential aircraft, but at a lower altitude.  it looked almost like the flying wing of the 1940s, 1950s, but had no visible engines.  i looked at my friend and said it was weird to see an aircraft so close to the presidents plane, and he agreed.  as the boomerang looking vehicle got closer (or so it appeared from my vantage point) to the presidential airplane, it suddenly slowed to a crawl, turned left and hovered there for just a slight moment, then started spinning like a boomerang.  then suddenly, the craft flew upwards and disappeared while spinning at an amazing speed.\r\n\r\nwhat made me notice the craft was it was heading towards the presidents plane, and it glistened brightly in the sun.\r\n\r\ni was curious to see such an aircraft, thinking it was an old flying wing, but when it made its maneuvers, then flew straight up at amazing speed, i was shocked.  i looked at my friend, and he just said he never saw a thing because nobody would ever believe us.  i've kept my mouth shut since, but since i have seen numerous weird lights in the skies at night, i thought i would finally say something.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
