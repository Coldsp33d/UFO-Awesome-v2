slowly, highly reflective and looked to either be changing physically or rotating. after about two(?) minutes, it had crossed from northwest to northeast, still moving laterally. i decided to swallow

the bus that day,  my friend's father agreed to drive us to school.  we attended a vocational school 30 minutes north of where we lived. it was a clear sunny morning and we were taking the usual route to shelby, ohio. as we drove through the countryside we spotted a bright light hovering over a body of water.  it was very odd to see a  large ball of light hovering over water and we wondered what it could be. then the light split into three parts, two flew off in other directions, and the remaining light began to follow our vehicle, but at a parallel distance. this really freaked out three teenaged girls  and my friend's father was getting irritated at our screaming and getting upset.  he was driving and could not see what we could see from his vantage point. the longer it followed us, the more upset we became, especially when it turned when our truck turned. it followed us all the way to school and by the time we got there we had made several 90 degree turns and it made every turn with us, and by the time we got to school it was no longer a bright light but a silver cigar-shaped tube like object flying nearly overhead and not making a sound.  at that time my friend's father did see it and wondered what it could be but thought we were silly and overreacting.  we were in tears by then and could not wait to get out of the truck and into the school building.  the object continued on in a straight line after we got out of the truck.  we were so upset when we got into the school, the kids asked us what was wrong and we made the big mistake of telling them what we saw. they made fun of us for a week or more and called us \"space girls\" and we were the joke of the school.  i stopped telling people about it so they wouldn't make fun of me anymore and think i was crazy, but i will never forget what i saw and i know it happened. to this day it bothers me to see a light divide into several lights (as in a movie) and turns my stomach a bit. i now think the object followed us out of curiosity, as we were riding in a powder blue 1 ton crew cab long bed pickup truck, and we stuck out like a sore thumb.

very bright white strobe lights, due north of my location & about 25 to 30 feet apart, flashed alternately twice.  then a second later they flashed again but were moving towards the east at a high rate of speed.  they diapered behind the trees and out of sight.  my first thought was it was a boat with led lighting or some type of firework on the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nwhat changed my mind was that the next day i was talking to out neighbor and he mentioned seeing the lights too.  i didn't bring it up because i had dismissed it. but, he saw the lights from his boat from i different perspective as me.  and, his description of the lights was identical to what i saw.  this eliminated my theory of fireworks or a boat.  there were at least two other people on his boat that saw the lights too.\r\n\r\nthese lights were about 10' above the water.  they were stationary then moved fast towards the ne and disappeared.  i know that others had to have seen them as there were a few boats out on the lake in the general vicinity.  this sighting happened very quickly which makes it difficult to determine much about what it was.  i am open to any suggestions but i have never seen anything like this on the lake in ten years.\r\n\r\nmy neighbor also said he saw a object, maybe a \"drone\", moving over the front yard of his house when he returned home after his boat ride.  his description was of a low flying slow moving object with a solid whitish light underneath it.  he said it looked like and old fashioned light bulb with an orange tint to it.  i am not sure why someone would be flying an expensive drone at night over a lake.  one slip up and it's gone for good.  maybe it is related to the sighting, maybe not.\r\n\r\nnote:  boats are not supposed to go faster than 25mph at night.  if this was a boat he was going more like 100mph without making any noise.  and, hovering 10 feet over the water.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

meadow.I stood there looking for a few minutes when i saw 3 lights at the other end of the meadow about 300 yards away moving along the edge of the meadow.I thought they were car headlights at first, but as i kept looking there were no cars. when they got about 100 yards away, they turned and came straight towards me moving extremely fast so i ran away from them as fast as i could. within a few seconds the first one passed over me engulfing me in blue and orange sparks and causing all the hair on my body to stand  up. i was so freaked out that i ran all the way out of the park (about 2 miles), and back to my house ,about 5 more miles . i would describe the objects as being 8ft diameter rolling spheres of light filled with blue and orange sparks. seeing these things would have been strange enough,but the fact that they changed direction and one hit me,was and still is traumatizing. i have told many people this story as it is the strangest thing that has ever happened to me. i am

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We live slightly up in the hills of ashland about 5-10 minutes out of downtown, surrounded by trees. both of my sons (ages 9 and 7) were outside camping in a tent they had setup on our deck facing east toward grizzly peak. this was the third night they had slept out there alone in a row. around 11:30pm they came running into the house petrified. i was dozing off lightly on the couch on the north side of the house. same level. my older son leads the way, his face is white and jaw is dropped. he's stuttering for words telling me that a big disc flew down over their tent and around our house. i asked them to elaborate, and they both started telling me the story in tandem and in agreement, practically word for word:\r\n\r\nmy older son was playing on a device when he saw a very bright pulsating light through the top of the tent near a small opening. he saw it but didn't care. he said moments later the light became so bright that he had to investigate. when he got out of the tent and looked up he said directly over their tent was a very bright light pulsation from a craft. the light was alone and pulsating from an eye shaped hole. he stared at it confused and thought for a split moment that it was a helicopter or an air plane. he said it then started showing different lights all around its body, and he saw that it was a disc shape, and that it was much closer than he thought, just near the tree line. he screamed for his brother to come see and shouted that it was a ufo. my younger son now begins telling the story: he said to my older son 'yea right --- your lying shut up', my older son insisted and stuck his head in the tent and yelled at him to come up. the younger boy comes out of the tent and said that he saw the large disc shape object moving slowly now over their heads and down to the house, blinking multitudes of lights. both boys are simultaneously speaking and using hang gestures to show me how the lights were moving around the spherical center of this disc. \"so many\" lights trailing everywhere. multiple colors, blue red and yellow. then, perfectly timed they both say \"then boom! one huge light came from the center! shining all over us!.\" so bright it lit up the trees.\r\n\r\nthey described the object as having a round dome on the top and bottom that the lights ran down. the the dome being bigger on top, with a bright light going around it horizontally. i was stunned at their reactions! this is extremely odd, especially for my older son who does not believe in anything other-worldly, and my younger son who seldom tells a lie. and never tells a lie without obviously displaying it with his body language. i asked them what the object looked like. they said it was \"amazing\", \"beautiful\", \"like something they had never seen before ever\". my son described it as metallic and struggled to find words through his emotion. i ask him how big it was, and they both agreed it was at least the size of a bus, if not 2 busses. i asked them if they thought maybe it was a drone or quadcopter? my older son said it could have been but that it was huge. i suggested that if it were a drone and were large that it would be very loud. he immediately realized and told me that this object was completely silent but may have had a faint humming sound which came from it (my younger son did not comment on this, and only agreed that it was extremely quiet).\r\n\r\ni began recording them immediately on my phone without them knowing so that i could replay it later. as they are telling me, my younger son sprinted back through the hallway to my baby daughter’s room (3 years old). also on the north side of the house. when i yelled for him not to wake her up, he came back out and said he wanted to make sure she was still there in her bed because it had flown that way. which i found heartwarming. i continued to ask them what it did and why was it here they thought? my older son said he didn't know, but that it was \"pacifically, pacifically at our house and interested in us\" ('specifically' he meant). they described again how this object became very active and moved down more into their field of view as if for them to watch. there is a clearing on the south side of the house that has no trees. where they described seeing this object was not at all hindered by trees. it would have been completely clear of obstructions with the nights sky behind it. using a lot of hand gestures they told me the disc started circling downward slowly on the south side of our house into the trees (the deck is on the east/south corner of the house). i asked them how low it was they thought and they adamantly said they could have thrown a rock at it and that it was very low. they then said in the same corkscrew fashion it went back up and directly over the top of our house, still displaying the multitudes of lights and colors. they said it went across our house slowly and headed towards our neighbors house (northward toward the side of the house i was sleeping on).\r\n\r\nthey said it then rose above the tree line and started flying away. they knew i was on that side of the house and ran in to come tell me. at my feet there are very large windows and my younger son insisted that i must have saw it. when i said i hadn't seen it they were shocked and disappointed. i asked them how long the ordeal took and my older son said at least 3 minutes. i asked them again if they thought it may have been a plane or some other sort of craft, and they both said it looked like something they had never seen ever, and my younger son insisted that he thought they were aliens and that he was worried. my older son agreed and said he could not imagine it being from this planet, but that he was not scared just shaken. he told me how shocked he was that he would ever get the chance to see something like this in his life. something that would make him change his mind about ufos and aliens existing.\r\n\r\ni told them that i believed them, and that i believe it to be likely that there are other beings in and around this planet and that perhaps these beings seized an opportunity to touch the minds of 2 young boys. they were very relieved that i believed them and insisted i message and tell their mom. they also asked to sleep with me because they were too scared to go into their rooms. this is also very odd behavior for them. as was it for them to both agree on every aspect, and be so worked up.","distance":"20

rise up from the direction of the richmond/martinez refinery docks along san pablo bay, then to pass over the carquinez bridge and then to proceed east along the carquinez strait. this video doesn't capture what we saw with our naked eyes, which is that these lights were bright red, glowing bright like road flares so they created an orb effect, though they appeared to be flashing \"electronically\". most notably, they appeared to be vertical \"sticks\" that moved through the air steadily, as opposed to the way balloons act when they are blown along by variable breezes. in fact, last night was far more still than most nights around here, when we typically get strong easterly winds. somehow the stick shapes remained perfectly vertical as they moved along, staying low over the strait at first before gaining elevation and going out of sight over benicia. there was no apparent reason for why they remained in the air; no balloons holding them aloft that one could see, or no airplane dragging them along behind. (it would have been too long of a trailing tail for such a thing to be done anyway.) the event lasted for a few minutes as more and more of them just kept coming up over the bridge. my wife saw them and thought we were being invaded. there was no sound as 20, possibly more, of these glowing orbs appeared, moving along the strait, rising in the sky and disappearing (blinking out?) more or less over benicia. the sight brought neighbors out of their houses to watch them. when i first saw the lights coming our way i thought that they may have been helicopters, until i saw their shapes. they seemed to move as if under control, looking a lot like those red orbs in close encounters of the third kind, but they were clearly vertical stick shapes with pulsating lights top and bottom. my second thought was that they may have been some form of those flying lanterns the asian community loves so, but these were clearly not flames we were seeing, but more like electronic flashing lights. a helicopter appeared in the area shortly after the event passed, and it circled for a time as if surveilling the area in which we had just seen these weird glowing lights. it was too dark by then to see what type of helicopter it was, but it looked big and it was loud, like the kind we have coming out of nearby travis air force base. you must look pretty hard to see the cluster of lights in the sky in this video, which is a snippet of a video that lasted for a couple minutes. you might be able to pick out the stick shape of some of the closer lights. it is the second instance of unidentified flying objects that we have seen in this area in the past six weeks. the earlier one was in bright daylight and looked like a very large but shallow rectangular shape that moved over vallejo then took a sharp left, turned sideways so that it became tall and narrow, and quickly moved in the direction of the coast. we have seen neither event noted in the local news and have no idea what it was that we saw - true unidentified flying objects. a few years back we saw four red lights moving over the valero refinery north of benicia, before the configuration changed shapes to a triangular form and slowly moved away from us. just sharing because it is all so weird and i can't imagine what any of it has been.","distance":"501 Feet -

(or no wings at all for that matter). i kept asking my wife “what is that and when is it going to head toward the runways”. traffic was moving slow and we we’re just past the light where the mcdonald's is located on east broad st. i’m looking though the front windshield off to my right, about 25 to 30 yards. and i keep saying out loud to my wife, “what is that, that is not a plane”. as it’s moving, about 5 to 10mph, (traffic has come to a stop) it slowly started going north bound over broad st, by then it’s directly over my car, my wife was very nonchalant about it, so i said to her “would you at least acknowledge that you see this thing, so i know that i’m not the only one who see’s it”. and she nonchalantly looks up and say’s “yes i see it”. so i lower my driver side window and look up and i’m looking directly underneath this thing and it’s not making a sound (no engine sound at all-nothing) and it’s low enough, that i could have thrown a rock at it and hit it. traffic finally started moving and i’m trying to keep an eye on both, the craft and traffic, it moved slowly northwest, just west of milano’s restaurant and hovered over the field. i told my wife screw this, i have to see what this thing is, so i turned around in the bp gas station lot and headed back, but by the time i got over there, it was gone.  no traces to be found.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":70237,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.9713274,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09072015-0017","longitude":-82.9173825,"occurred":1170460800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1441629193000,"summary":"It was moving very slow and wasn't making any noise.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-5,"maxtempi":23,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":-10,"meantempi":14,"meanvism":15,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":-14,"mintempi":6,"minvism":4,"minvisi":2,"rain":false,"snow":true,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-5,"maxtempi":23,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":-10,"meantempi":14,"meanvism":15,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":-14,"mintempi":6,"minvism":4,"minvisi":2,"rain":false,"snow":true,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3138,"locationName":"Columbus, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8497"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Nashua","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I had purchased a used car in need of repairs earlier that week. the previous owner of the car had arranged to have it towed to my house that evening so i was at the end of my driveway waiting for the tow truck. i just happened to look up at the area just above the tree line about 2500 feet away to the south west and noticed what i thought was a pair of running lights to a small plane. i watched for about a minute and realized it was not a plane when one of the pair of lights turned about 90 degrees and headed to the north west. the other continued in a straight line heading south east. it continued over the neighborhood at approximately 1000 feet up over my house moving slowly. it made no sound at all and i noticed a slight red pulsation from the center of the object. to describe it exactly i would say it was spherical, bright orange with a slight red center pulsation. at 1000 feet up i would estimate it's size to be about 20 feet across. it took at least a full minute to pass over the neighborhood disappearing over the tree line to the north east and just when i thought it was finally over i looked back at the tree line south west where i saw the first two and saw two more heading on the same path as the one that just passed over!

another 30 to 50 feet up..I tried to get my cell phone out of my pocket book, but pocket book was underneath newspapers unfortunately,so just kept observing and memorizing everything i could! ther were 8 to ten dashes going back each side from tip, then a blank space same size of dashes the 8 to 10  white dashes , it looked to be a perfect equilateral triangle. lights were bright like leds but not sending light down to the ground.As it came over me i heard a steady hum it was not very loud at all, i think the hum was an a or an e,  but i don't have perfect pitch.The ufo as it slowly went over. me took a slow turn toward the northeast, it stayed perfectly flat as it did this, it did not appears to bank at all, the direction it was turning was toward pease air force base.So i thought maybe it is a stealth bomber.After it started turning it went behind tree line so i continued with route took right onto sargent, then quick right onto main street caught one more quick site of it over trees to my right.I am out on the road every night, i barely ever see a plane, and when i do they are way up, can barely hear them, this was huge, guessing about length of tractor trailer truck,my last thought was, how come everyone else sees flying saucers and i see a flying triangle?When i got home i described it all in detail to my husband, then when my son got up i said guess what

feet off the ground and it was listening to the music, not moving at all.  i kept two playing 2 more verses and moved my attention to it, as it hovered like someone standing there listening.  i wanted to touch it or see if it would move so i stopped playing.  just then it start moving about a foot a second to my left and went 12 feet across the room and right through the wall.  i ran to the window and watched it accelerate up the hill about 5 feet off the ground into the woods and out of sight.  \r\n\r\nit was not raining or lightening.  it was not scary or threatening.  it was an observation

the carports in the back.  beyond those carports were more apartment buildings.\r\n\r\ni slept in the living room of this one bedroom apartment and could look through the kitchen door to the window.  i was sitting on my bed when i became aware that there were flashing white lights reflecting off the second story windows of the far apartments on the other side of the carports.  i realized that whatever was flashing those lights was located above the roof of my building.  there was no noise.\r\n\r\nat first, i was going to look out the window and up, but i became afraid and instead crouched down in front of the sink and tried to hide.  in a few moments, the flashing lights were gone, and i then looked out the window.  i saw an orb of light, very large and a beautiful sea green color, just floating slowly away, rising to the tree tops and drifting out of sight.  this was in the city near the ocean.\r\n\r\nthe circle of light was contained in that it was solid and couldn't be seen through, but no light escaped it, and it appeared incandescent.  it was nothing like i have ever seen before.  it floated like a soap bubble but seemed to have a purpose and direction.  it was rather like watching a cartoon.  i didn't see anything sticking out of it. or any other flashing lights.\r\n\r\ni yelled to my mother to look out her bedroom window, but she didn't understand and missed seeing it.  the next day, i checked all the local papers searching for mention of anything unusual, but nothing turned up.  i told a coworker the next day what i had seen, but she looked at me like i was crazy, and didn't ask any questions about it.\r\n\r\ni have remembered this for all these years, as i feel now, being older, i should have looked fully out the window, but at the time i was really afraid.  i really think i saw a ufo that night.  i remember being absolutely amazed as i watched it leave, but while it was over the roof, i was terrified.\r\n\r\ni'll be honest, i was having an argument with my mother, and i have always felt that somehow i attracted the darn thing.  right or wrong, i felt like it had been listening.  when we stopped because i began to watch out the window, it left.  needless to say, i showed much more respect to my mother after that!","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering
