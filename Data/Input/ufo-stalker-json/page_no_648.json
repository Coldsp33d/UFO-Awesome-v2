and though we live close to an airport, there were no other traditional air vehicles in the area. we are very familiar with the movement of air traffic in our area and this object did not move like any aircraft we've seen. the sky was clear, no clouds and was empty except for this object.\r\n\r\nmy neighbor noticed it over my shoulder so i turned around when she asked what it was. what attracted our attention was it's brightness and the rapid position changes in its flight (up, down, left, right). it appeared only bright white at first and then after a short while pulsed an additional white light, almost the same size but still a part of the sphere.  as it began moving rapidly north, a red light appeared that did not flash. then blue light appeared that did begin blinking.\r\n\r\nat first we thought that the pulsing lights could be traditional airline lights but the very abrupt changes of direction and elevation convinced us it wasn't an airliner or a military jet.  we considered a stealth helicopter, but that seemed unlikely too. \r\n\r\nit started in the southeast, ascended, appeared to reverse, moved west slightly, then back toward east. it picked up speed rapidly straight north disappearing behind the trees over percy priest lake which is about a mile from where we were standing. it then shot straight east over the lake out of sight.\r\n\r\ni've got phone video saved

my son noticed this object coming toward us from behind me.  he said, \"what the heck is that\" and i turned around looking for a bird or something.  i was taken aback when i noticed this object.  i am by far an expert, but i have been in the air firce for 16 years working aircraft maintenance (avionics).  i walked toward the object trying to get a better angle under it because i could not make out any wings.  the object didn't make any noise.  it was metallic color like a delorian and the glow is the sunlight reflecting off its surface.  the flight path in the picture is from right to left.  i was so fixated on trying to make out wings and what type of aircraft, that i didn't think of pictures until i noticed it approaching the tree line.  i rushed to get out my iphone and take the picture.\r\n\r\ni am still dumbfounded on what this was.  i first thought a blimp or something because there are not any wings.  then i also see there is no pod beneath it.  i just chalked it up to a ufo.  not necessarily alien related but definitely unidentifiable.\r\n\r\ni recently made a connection to an old video of bob lazar and how he illustrates the propulsion system and the \"gravity wave\" that surrounds a ship.  i then noticed the same magnetic field or gravity wave shape can be seen coming off this object in the picture.   it looks as if the reflected light is being bent around a magnetic field!\r\n\r\nthis could be nothing but i figured i could send this off to you folks to look at.  i am just a novice that doesn't \"believe\" but i do have an open mind and watch plenty

30-40* overhead and just barely entering my field of view as i was facing south.  the solid white light covered 10 lateral degrees before a blue starlike light (smaller by half) descended straight down, from a fixed place, quickly and changed direction abruptly to follow no more than 10 lateral degrees behind the the white light.  there was a noticible increase in speed by about 2 lateral degrees by both objects.  after both objects covered about 30 lateral degrees a second blue starlike light, exactly like the second object, dropped quickly down from a fixed location and then changed direction to follow the first object (white bright light).  this went on for another approx. 20 degrees and the first object (bright white light) dimmed out fast and the two stralike clear blue lights split up and disappeared from my view after some distance.  this occurred in an approx. 15 second timeframe at approx. 2145-2150.  i verbally recorded my account of the event on my  iphone and still have it.\r\n\r\nlater that evening, at the end of my night, i was stationary in the work truck servicing a house and was staring at ursa major which was close to the equatorial plane.  within the four major stars that make up the \"pot\" and to the inside of the furthest most right top star, another blue light appeared, faint at first then more clear, dropping slowly from approx 15-20 degrees to commercial plane traffic height.  it stopped and stayed in place (from my perspective) for some time (maybe 20-30 seconds).  i had to look just to the left of it so my eyes could pick it up.  it began to flash blue, blue, blue, then red, blue, red, blue, then went white and flashed red like an airplane beacon light and slowly headed west, acting like an airplane.  it was a much longer event and it weirded me out and excited me at the same time.  i still have my recordings of what happened but haven't listened to them since and can't figure how to send them or attach them here. i ended my work night and headed back to the tri cities at about midnight i believe.\r\n\r\nthat's it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

i heard her say 'its big and coming right towards our house'. my wife repeated herself a few times so i opened my front door, i remember my stocking feet became cold due to the residual snow on the top on my front stairs. i witnessed a large craft very slowly moving across my neighbors  property (across the road from my property). it had two large lights, like large, very bright search lights. there were two columns of light going from the craft to the ground. the lights seemed to come from two 'nosecones' for lack of a better word. these nosecones protruded from the front of the craft. i could see their outline from the stars they blocked from view. the lights moved, very slowly, in tandem like they were searching for something or someone. i could see the outline of the huge craft by the number of stars it blocked from view. the craft appeared to be moving at about 1-2 miles an hour. i couldn't believe that a craft that large was only slightly moving. it was over in less than 10 minutes from my first sighting until it was out of my view. the craft was a dark dull black in color, on the sides and bottom. i could not see the top.\r\ni saw many aircraft, including helicopters while serving in vietnam. this craft was something i had never seen before. i marveled that i could not hear any sound coming from the craft. my tv was on at the time, so i shut it off and listened again. i heard a very low base, slight rumbling sound coming from the craft. i noticed that my ribs had began to slightly vibrate. looking at the coffee table near me i saw ripples, rings on the surface of the drink i had there. the rumble was very muffled, and i had to strain to hear it. there were no other sounds coming from the craft. there were no other lights on the craft except for the search lights.\r\nwhile i had a camera i did not think to take photos of the craft and lights.","distance":"101-500

star moving across the horizon in the distance. \r\n\r\ni usually don't go that direction but i had to investigate to see what it was. after driving about a mile i reached the area i had seen it and what i saw completely caught me off guard.\r\n\r\nover to the left of the road across from the local high school was a subdivision of houses and as i pulled up i saw a large disc about 40 to 50 feet in size hovering over top of one of them. it was shining a bluish white beam of light on the roof hovering completely silently (almost like it was suspended by ropes or something). the beam of light was coming from what looked like a rectangular shaped window on the side of it. \r\n\r\ni couldn't see the top of it because it was at night but the bottom of it was covered in lights and was extremely bright. in the center of the bottom was a huge red light and then the rest of the bottom was covered with small white lights. \r\n\r\nafter a few minutes of observing it from the road i decided to get a closer look so i drove down the hill into the subdivision. at this point i was probably 50 feet away from it looking up at about a 45 degree angle. just at that moment the ufo apparently took notice i was there and slowly glided over top of another house in the opposite direction away from me. it then stopped and hovered over top of it like it did the other house.\r\n\r\na couple of more minutes passed (about 5 minutes total combined) and then i noticed that a car up in the school parking lot across the street started to leave. i hadn't even paid attention to it since i arrived because i was so focused on the ufo. \r\n\r\ni was kind of in shock because my immediate thought was \"there's a ufo hovering over a house and you're just going to drive away?!\". i couldn't believe anybody would do that. a few seconds after the car started driving away the ufo slowly started moving in that direction away from me almost like it was following the car.\r\n\r\nof course i didn't want it to get away so i floored my old chevy cavalier as fast it could go out of the subdivision and back onto the main road but by the time i got up on top of the hill there was nothing. there was no trace of the ufo or car. it was like they both just vanished. \r\n\r\nit's been over 20 years since i witnessed that event but it's something that will be etched in my memory forever. i've done a lot of thinking about it and the only conclusion i can come to is that it wasn't from this planet. the only possible alternative would be military experimental aircraft but that doesn't explain why it was hovering over top of a house shining a bluish white beam of light on the roof with an engine that didn't make any sound.\r\n\r\nattached is a drawing of what i witnessed using

as it cleared the trees i thought this is unlike anything i have ever seen in the night sky. i immediately knocked on the patio door of our trailer to get my wife's attention. she joined me in watching this object as it continued in a westerly direction. the sphere was the same color as a orange halogen streetlight. it made no sound and no deviation in flight path. it continued on it way until we lost sight of it in the trees on the horizon. at this point i turned to my wife and asked if she had ever seen anything like it before. she responded with a negative. it was an unsettling experience. \r\nat this point i proceeded to attempt to light our fire again when she exclaimed there is another one! coming right in the same path as the first sphere. on this one i observed
