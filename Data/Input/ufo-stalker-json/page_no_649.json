  i heard some of the men talking to one another saying \"its too late to bring her back up\"!! one said \"we can pass her through the plane\", i was told telepathically to stay perfectly still,  when a saw the underneath of the plane i was so traumatized that moved my head to the left and felt a searing pain down the right side of my neck!! an urgent voice again -stay still!!  i eventually was back on my bed. i got up after a few minutes and thought to myself, was that a dream?.  i went to the kitchen to make breakfast for my sons and myself.  i could still feel a severe burning down my neck.  i went to look in the mirror and sure enough there was an 8 inch burn mark on my neck!! i showed it to my sons and told them what had happened.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":70189,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-26.2716707,"location":null,"logNumber":"ZA-09062015-0014","longitude":28.0376373,"occurred":364003200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Gauteng","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Saturn-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1441534447000,"summary":"Lay down to sleep, awoke in a spaceship,events happened, injury on the way back.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Africa/Johannesburg","timeZoneName":"Africa/Johannesburg","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":12471,"locationName":"Johannesburg South, Gauteng","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8601"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Castaic","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"1- at home\r\n2- i happen to be looking at orion while drinking coffee\r\n3- i had no idea\r\n4- it was blinking so i thought it was a satellite but it was stationary,\r\nthen it moved just left of orion very slowly then up and to the right and \r\nit just vanished.\r\n5- exited \r\n6-it vanished","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":70187,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.469835885751735,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09062015-0013","longitude":-118.62634031566034,"occurred":1441517400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1441531521000,"summary":"Blinking light near orions belt stionary for 1 minute then moving left of orion slowly then moving right and then dissapearing","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"91384","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Castaic, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8602"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Thornton","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At 5:20 a.M. i took my dog for a walk and noticed a bright light in the east, just above the power lines. i stopped and observed for a few minutes then went about my walk. i figured it was venus or maybe mars. i was outside about 10 minutes and the light didn't move, though it looked to be changing color from orange/gold to green, pink then yellow. i went into the house to get my other dog and cell phone.\r\n\r\ncame back outside after about 5 minutes, now about 5:40 a.M. walked out to the bridge and took a few still shots then walked about 500 yards and looked back toward where the light had been. it had moved!

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This is a true story i will tell you to the best of my ability:\r\n\r\ni woke up and my back was against metal, i was standing with my hands palms down on the surface.\r\n\r\nthe metal was dark grey and it was soft to the touch, you could press on it and it was soft. \r\n\r\nit was very quiet and there was no movement i could not perceive any noise or movement of anyone inside our out and there were no windows.\r\n\r\nthere were a few others there, people, i could see a younger man...They seemed asleep.\r\n\r\nwe were spaced out as if standing up in soft metal beds if you will. there was no identifiable structure i can compare them too. but i can see them in my mind and i have drawn them.\r\n\r\n it was a circular floor with the walls bending in a circle when i looked left and right and it was kind of dimly lit. \r\n\r\ni think whatever was making us sleep didn't work well on me as i kept waking up for moments at a time everyone else seemed sound asleep. \r\n\r\ni felt very calm and i didn't seem, to want to speak or make a sound.  i knew i was inside some kind of craft..I then passed out for some reason.\r\n\r\ni half woke up a while later and i cracked my eyes open we were on a surface traveling in some kind of vehicle. \r\n\r\ni could see that all of the structures were about 1/2 the to 1/3 the size of ours, some kind of city. \r\n\r\neverything seemed to be this sandstone color, the ground, the structures, everything. \r\n\r\nit was busy there was a lot of activity outside. \r\n\r\nthere were beings in the vehicle with us, it was moving very fast, it did not have wheels, it was silent as it moved it has no engine, they were also smaller than us. \r\n\r\nthey seemed to be very focused and serious. \r\n\r\ni then awoke later on, i have no idea how much time had passed, in fact the whole time, time seemed to stand still if you will. i have no sense of time.\r\n\r\ni was inside a room that seemed to be sandstone of some kind. there was nothing\r\n\r\nin the room but the walls when i looked up they were open to the sky.\r\n\r\nthere was a sandstone type of bench built into the wall and i stood on it and i looked out. \r\n\r\ni saw a very large circular structure made of the same sandstone type material, in the middle\r\n\r\nwas a chair like a big throne type chair also made of this material and the man i saw was sitting in\r\n\r\nit.  i looked up and this is the first time i saw the alien, he was up higher than the man in some \r\n\r\nkind of control type booth looking out over the circle with the chair. he looked over at me and he \r\n\r\nspoke to me but telepathically, he said \"be calm, everything is ok\" and i don't know how i knew how \r\n\r\nto do this but i asked him \"what are doing?\" ...Telepathically. \r\n\r\nit is as if we lost our voices.\r\n\r\n a red ball appeared in front of me, about twice the size of a tennis ball\r\n\r\nthat seemed to defy gravity. it had a hypnotic effect. he smiled at me! \r\n\r\ni became fixated on this ball and lowered myself down, it followed and i grabbed it slowly and began\r\n\r\nto throw it against the wall and it bounced back in slow motion in some kind of hypnotic rhythm.\r\n\r\nit was enjoyable and it calmed me. he gave me a toy to play with! lol! :)\r\n\r\nafter a while, i don't know how long ....I climbed back up onto the bench and looked out\r\n\r\nagain..This time i saw a rush of energy going very fast in between the chair and the sandstone walls\r\n\r\nin this big circle. nothing was moving but the energy flying around in a circle. \r\n\r\nthis time he spoke to me again when i asked telepathically \"what are you doing?\" he said which\r\n\r\ni could only hear his voice in my mind. \r\n\r\n\"this is our way of measuring and extracting information about your mental/telepathic abilities\"\r\n\r\nthe man was sitting still and did not seem hurt or in pain in anyway, he actually seemed as if\r\n\r\nhe was in a coma/trance. like he wasn't even there. i seemed to be the only one awake.\r\n\r\nthe alien told me that \"....The next step in your human evolution is these mental abilities.....\" he said\r\n\r\nthat some of us are already in the beginning stages of telepathy but he said that the\r\n\r\nabilities move far, far beyond that when we reach where they are.\r\n\r\nhe also told me that they had good intentions towards us and that have been coming to us \r\n\r\nfor a very long time and they were not the ones frightening us.\r\n\r\nhe looked at me and the other thing he could do was transmit emotion and images to me\r\n\r\nfrom a distance. he looked at me and sent over a very enlightened positive feeling that made me \r\n\r\nsmile and he showed me the good intentions that they held. \r\n\r\ni can see him now in my mind and i smile as oddly enough, they have affection and a feeling\r\n\r\nof humor. but the things he projected over to me were of a vast wisdom and i looked at him\r\n\r\nknowingly.  he said that the information was enough to begin telling others, but others\r\n\r\nshould also know here.  and then in a blink of an eye he was gone and i lost track of time and\r\n\r\nspace and they had returned me. \r\n\r\ni have been able to draw the room, the structures, the device i saw that they use for measuring.\r\n\r\neverything. my memory is very clear.  i don't know how this happened it just did. \r\n\r\ni have known all of my life that i have a 6th sense, i guess that is why i was there, i don't know.\r\n\r\nthey never did anything to frighten me and seemed to want this not to be a bad experience. \r\n\r\n......................Thank you for reading. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet

around 21:50, i had been outside for a few minutes and was enjoying looking up at the stars as it was a clear, crisp night, when something caught my eye to the north.\r\n\r\nat first i had thought it was a shooting star, but there was something odd about the trajectory of it which made me keep looking to see if there would be another.  the streak i initially saw was red in colour and formed a line at about 30 degrees to the horizon, sort of going just above capella.  the line had faded but i kept looking into that part of the sky as it had felt like something wasn't right about the way it moved, as i kept watching i saw what i initially though was a satellite moving just slightly to the east of capella, but this then changed direction, something like a jet pulling out of a climb, banking sharply to its right and back on itself and then levelling out and moved extremely fast across the eastern sky from north to the south east where i lost sight of it. during the final part of the manoeuvre it had resolved into two distinct red points of light, unblinking and remaining the same distance apart from on another.\r\n\r\nat first i had thought it was a fast jet when it pulled the turn manoeuvre, and it looked fast....But i was astounded at exactly how fast it then moved basically from the north to the south in 2-3 seconds! during this time there was no noise whatsoever, i thought there should have been, or a sonic boom, given the speed it appeared to be going...But nothing.\r\n\r\nmy gut feeling was that this was a jet sized object, and was at a relatively low altitude, this based on the fact the two points of light became distinct the \"closer\" it got and were not observable as two points of light at the beginning or the end of the observation...But the speed it moved was incredible...I was just left thinking \"what the ... was that?!\"","distance":"Over One

or flickering.  it was pulsating and flickering both while moving and stationary.  as far as feelings, it was interesting and i believe that i have witnessed my first ufo.","distance":"Over One

dark. there was a large, grassy lot next to our house where our uncle lived in a mobile home at the back of the lot. it was a clear night and my brother was teaching me some of the constellations as we walked.\r\n\r\nwe saw a gold colored light come from the south and hover over us. i thought it was an airplane at first but as it got closer, i realised it wasn't making any noise. i remember being afraid but my brother was excited. he said \"oh, wow, they are real!\" i grabbed his arm and tried to pull him to the house, panicking. he laughed and told me to calm down, that they wouldn't hurt us. he was my brother so.. i trusted him to protect me. i stood behind him as the light came to the ground and landed in front of my uncles house.\r\n\r\nit was a large black triangle.. well, pyramid shape that was missing the top point. it had a couple of windows on the side, about halfway up. after it stopped moving, a slot opened up on the side facing us. the light that was under the craft was a greenish blue and it hovered off the ground a foot or two as the slot opened and a being came out. i guess unfolded out would be more accurate. the being looked almost human with a large, odd shaped head, almond eyes the color of absolute darkness and a small slit below where the nose slits were. it was very tall compared to my brother. he was about ten years old so probably 4 and a half feet. the being was maybe six or seven feet. \r\n\r\nwhen it exited the ship, i heard a noise, like a soft murmuring of a bunch of voices. i was immediately soothed. i felt sleepy suddenly but then the entity took my hand and my brothers hand. i don't remember it walking to us but i remember how cold it's hand was and how rubbery it felt. i felt like i was floating and it was taking us to it's ship. we went inside and the slot closed behind us. \r\n\r\ninside, it took us to a room where my brother was taken by another being and i was led to a table. i screamed for my brother but the being picked me up and sat me on the table, placed his fingers on my eyes and i couldn't move or talk any more. i was laid on the table and my clothes were taken off. \r\n\r\ni remember there being a soft pink light and three beings in the room with me. there was a straw like tool hanging above me that one being put against my belly button. i remember searing pain below my belly button and smelling hot metal, like copper. i screamed but then the pain was gone.\r\n\r\n i looked toward one of the beings and saw my brother on the table near mine. he was looking at me with tears in his eyes. i could hear his voice but his lips weren't moving. he told me he was sorry, he was wrong and that he loved me. i felt warm where before i was so cold. the beings stopped moving as my brother and i talked without moving our lips. i would think at him then hear his voice responding to me. we'd never been able to do that before!\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes, my brother looked away from me and i felt him slip away, mentally, then he screamed like he was being murdered. i thought they were killing him but i couldn't see anything because one of the beings moved between us and started looking in my ears with a bright light.\r\n\r\n i remember the grey color of those three fingered hands, the way they seemed to me to be rubber straws, the tips against my skin feeling terribly similar to a frogs flesh. they pried open my eyes when i tried to scrunch them shut and put a jelly substance in them. then they stuck something up in my nose that hurt so bad i passed out.\r\n\r\nwhen i woke up, the ship was gone. my brother was laying in the ditch a few feet from me and i thought he was dead. i heard my mother calling for me and my brother so i sat up and called back to her. she ran to me from our yard to where my brother was laying and when she saw him, she screamed. she picked him up and grabbed my hand, carrying him into the house. she asked me what happened as she laid him on the couch but as i started to answer, my nose started bleeding.\r\n\r\nmy brother came to as my mother wiped a cold rag over his face and i got a washcloth for my nose. she kept asking why we were out till three in the morning. my brother told her about the craft and i did too but she said she thought we were trying to make stuff up. she said it was obvious someone had beaten us up. we saw how bad our story upset her so we agreed, it was the local bully that beat us both up. \r\n\r\nafter my mother went to bed, when she thought we were asleep, my brother came into my room and we talked about it, agreeing to not talk about it again. \r\n\r\nthe next day, he and i went to my uncles yard. we looked for signs that something had been there and we saw a square portion of the grass had been pressed down like a heavy weight had been on top of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nit's been almost thirty years now and only recently have my brother and i spoken of the incident. i still remember it like it was yesterday and so does he.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Path then
