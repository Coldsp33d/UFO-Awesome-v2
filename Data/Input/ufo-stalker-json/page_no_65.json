pollution in this valley or my neighbourhood. as i reached one of the largest gaps between houses in that neighbourhood, i saw a big glowing red orb of light. i didn't panic, i simply stood still and observed. the orb was slowly moving across the sky. i want to say it was headed west, but i am unsure. so it moved slowly for about 10 maybe 15 seconds. then it stopped and remained still for maybe a solid 5 minutes. it felt like an eternity, so i will say five instead of 10 because it did feel like 10. i continued observing it when suddenly it flew spontaneously in the complete opposite direction and was gone within an instant. it was lightning fast. i just continued with my walk and tried to process what i had just witnessed. it was a very interesting event.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
