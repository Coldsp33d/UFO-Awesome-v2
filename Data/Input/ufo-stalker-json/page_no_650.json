reported in this file.\r\nobserve, that was night, i was not dreaming, and we were mentally in touch.  \r\ni supposed not to be envolved with this experience, as i said, we were together by accident.\r\nanyway, we observed the ufos close to moon and later, this federal agent, showed me a office and a laboratory with a big generator with courtains of radiant colours. \r\nit seemed to me like a tournado, round and round. \r\nwhat i could realize there is official experiences envolving humans and spatials (as i call the extra terrestrials).\r\nmessages of these experiences was about world preservation, human kind, nature and specially thoughts and feellings.\r\nthe us official member asked to project thoughts of kindness, peace, harmony, etc, feeding, energizing, the mental field of earth.\r\nwhy? us government, in this especif case, could use this power, mental resources, to provide human race life. \r\nthere are more details, but it is not my intention to sound like a

were leaving the state permanently, so it was friends of over 20 years saying goodbye.\r\ni live near a lake, we were standing in the front yard, talking & looking up at the stars. there are no street lights & it was around midnight so there was not lights from the few other homes on the lake.  it was a beautiful, clear starry night. i glanced up & saw a shiny, star bright object streaking across the sky, moving from west to east, so fast it was difficult to keep up with. i called attention to it to my friends. we all engaged in a conversation about what it was. absolutely to fast to be a conventional aircraft. bright glowing light a few thought might be the iss, until it made a sudden course correction from west to south east, without slowing down. then it started to slow down. when it was almost over my home it came to a stop. above it appeared a light, circular in shape, aboute ten times bigger than the ship. it was kinda of strange because you could see stars beyond jnto & around the center. the light was dimmer in this opening, maybe because light was reflecting back. the craft ascended into the center & suddenly disappeared. the portal closed immediately & the sky looked totally normal again.

9/4/2015\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nwhile living in the flamingo trailer park behind the karcher mall i saw a craft in the sky.\r\nit was the summer of 1977 about midnight i thought i saw lights out side and i looked out the window and saw a football field sized craft hovering near the parking lot of the mall. it was parking lot light high.It seemed to have red, blue, and green light, but i realized it was energy, not lights. i called to my wife to see and she was speechless. it was there 10 minutes before i went to get the camera, but it had no film. i ran outside toward the craft, ignoring my wife yelling at me to come back. i was 20 years old and thought i was tough. i approached the craft and waved my arms at it. it lowered a ramp for me. the ramp was 4\" thick and glistened like sand, it did have a sand like appearance. half the way up two small child like beings came toward me and stopped on either side of me. they were 2 1/2' tall, white skinned with empty eyes. they moved like robots, something was not right about them. they wore royal blue suits with a silver strip on them that did sparkle. i reached over to pick one up and a voice told me not to, that they would hurt me. i walked up the ramp and stopped at the entrance to the ship. a voice asked me if i was coming in or not. so i went in. the creature was built like a linebacker and covered in short brown hair. it had perfect teeth and humanoid eyes and face. it had arms and a torso, but no legs or feet. where the feet should have been was maybe a large foot with suckers on the bottom. when it moved it made sucking and squeaking noises. the creature talked to me in perfect english and very mannerly. it also used telepathy. i was scanned in four different upright machines, i didn't have to lay down and as far as i know they took no blood. i asked where he came from and he said he couldn't say. he showed me around the ship and the next thing i remember i was standing outside on the parking lot. the craft moved/jumped several blocks, making no noise at all. then it moved/jumped straight up, hovered, and moved/jumped away very fast.  \r\ni hadn't remembered much of the story until i saw a national geographic special about hairy animals in the water. then it all came back to me.\r\nsince this happened to me i have had a very bad memory, neraphy, diabetes and black outs. i have been to a doctor and want to be hypnotized to see if i can remember more. i'm only 58 years old.","distance":"20 Feet or

ufo encounter now, back at 2011 i was still in the us army and i was just scary that telling this will make me some kind of joke.\r\n\r\ni was a ssg in light infantry unit, at that time we were doing a brigade size training exercise in playas area, nm in desert type environment with medium to high mountain peek.\r\n\r\ni was the nco in charge of a recon squad and test out to set up an observation point to spot and gave warning defense comm to our main patrol base on  enemy movement. it was in the afternoon that we arrived at the highest point and i assigned to my guys their respective sector of guard/fire and i was in the middle of this op base. \r\n\r\ni don't remember the time but we still have daylight so as april my estimate time is between 04 - 0430 pm. our altitude was around 3000 ft and i just looked straight above me and i saw this moving triangle shape object and i thought was a commercial airplane. suddenly it stopped and right away in my mind i thought that's wasn't possible and where was the exhaust tail from the jet engine!!\r\n\r\nit was just few seconds and it was really high but i can see with my naked eyes ( my estimate total altitude of the object was around 25000 feet). it can be less as i can see this weird bright orange color and white in the middle of it and i was amazed again from the fact that was there not moving at all! few seconds of hovering and that object speed up and just disappear, plain simple.\r\n\r\ni looked around to see if somebody was looking like me but they were just fixing their firing positions. i just told myself that never happened and move on. \r\n\r\nfew months ago i got out from the service but it is still stamped in my mind.\r\n\r\nthanks to give us a voice.\r\n\r\nv/r\r\n\r\njoseph

sparsely populated streets, cogswell and westvale, several miles out of town. the houses were far apart. there was a field across the street and trees behind us. i think the house is now in the middle of a subdivision  all of the abductions occurred at night when everyone in the house should be asleep.  two entities would come to my bedroom window.  i would suddenly find myself outside with them. i don't remember getting out of bed. the entities were not much taller than me, had large heads and black, oval eyes that were too big for their heads. i don't recall seeing the whites of their eyes. there were only slits or lines where the mouth and nose should be.  they were otherwise very skinny. their skin was greyish-brownish color. i thought they were sick, funny looking kids at the time. their clothes were skin tight. i was never afraid. they kept reassuring me telepathically. i heard them, but their mouths never opened. i also empathically felt that they did not want to hurt me. they seemed friendly. they made me feel very safe.\r\n\r\n  i only remember the following happening the first time. they walked me to the craft which was in my backyard in a large sandy area that dad often complained about because nothing could be planted there, then up a ramp to the inside.  a third entity was in charge of flying the craft. i stood by the window as the craft took off. we flew into space to a larger craft.  in retrospect, the craft must have flown very fast, because we flew past other planets.  i remember seeing saturn with all the big rocks flying around it.  i also saw jupiter, which they explained about the hot, poison gases and how they did not want to get too near the planet with the ship.  i told my parents, teacher and other students at school about the planets. all assumed that i had read about these things in books. but i didn't have such books at home and we were not studying the galaxy in second or third grade.\r\n\r\n  the small craft flew into a larger craft where i was led into a cold, metal room with other adult humans all sitting on a metal bench that was build into the wall and lined the entire room except where the doors were. everyone stared straight ahead, as if they were drugged. they did not acknowledge or speak to me or anyone else. another entity lead the gentleman next to me out another door, much like a nurses aid in a doctor's waiting room. that was the last thing i remember until i woke up the next day in my own bed. \r\n\r\nafter the first encounter, i would see the little people at my window and the craft in the backyard, but do not remember anything else. only waking up the next morning in my bed. my mother always referred to them as my little green men, assuming that i made them up although it was very real to me.  it's one of the clearest memories i have as a child.\r\n\r\n  when i was 30, i had a tubal ligation done to tie my fallopian tubes.  the doctor was able to do one side, but something kept him from reaching the other side.  he decided to do exploratory surgery. he found masses of scar tissue. he was perplexed because there was nothing in my medical history to explain this.  i wonder if i was one of those abductees on which exploratory surgery was performed.   \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n    ","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

saw a huge triangular object gliding  very low over my house in milford, connecticut in the harbor of the housatonic river. the object was the size of a large department store and had a green hue, and was flaming in the back, the flames were wild like a bon fire, and as long as a football field, but cast no light. the flames were so large that the sky should have been lit like it was day. this ship made no noise and glided so smooth, the object was so large that it should have fallen from the sky at the speed it was going.  i did report this on the internet the night it happened and have had many responses from people who saw the same object that night at the same time in the same direction.\r\nthe reason i am reporting now to mufon is because i did not even no who mufon was at the time of the sighting. \r\nalso the reason i am contacting you is because of an episode of \"hangar 1\" i recently watched,\r\nit was the \"far side of the moon\" episode.. \r\nthere was a 3d model of the ship you guys had in the show. i had never seen that ship anywhere except the night i saw it in person. as soon as i saw your model i started getting hit with anxiety. that is exactly what i saw, but it was on fire.\r\ni have lots of current info that i am afraid to share on this site but am willing to share in person.\r\ni also have pictures of some other unexplained objects taken when the sky was full of chemtrails.\r\ni have attached a picture that i made to show what i saw in 2008\r\ni have no phone and can only be reached by the email i have provided.\r\ni have been in contact with jan c. harzan, and he is the person who suggested i report this sighting so late in the game.\r\nplease understand that this has affected my life and also i feel i might have lost time the night i encountered this ship.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
