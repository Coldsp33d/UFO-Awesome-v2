and noticed the lights that seemed to be fairly low over the bay. i first thought it was a airplane or hellicopter since the concord airport was only a few miles away. the 3 lights were small star like, 2 outer light flashing, inner light not. the lights stayed in place not moving for several minutes as i was now driving into pittsburg; which is why i began to think it was not a aiplane or hellicopter. i also noticed there was no other colored lights. as i was entering antioch and checked to my left again, the lights were now traveling eastward no longer at the angle but horizontal and the lights were no longer flashing but solid. i lost track of it for a few minutes but as i pulled into my street, which is a court, the end is open facing the freeway north, i could see the lights. it seemed to turn/spin around so that 3 larger lights now faces me. so i guess the small star like lights in back to the large basketball size lights in front. it then moved a little westward after that and i was barely able to see it through the trees. moments after a hellicopter with red and green or blue light traveled from southwest to north in direction of lights. i couldn't see anything after that from my house because the trees obstructed view.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I woke this morning at exactly 05:32 am.I set my alarm for 6 am, but am routinely awake before that. i had heated a cup of yesterdays coffee and had sat in my recliner and started watching the 1980's movie with mathew broderick \"war games\". my day generally starts in this manner, pryor to my daily exercise routines. i have the habit of sitting watching the sun rise, and the morning weather conditions from first the kitchen window and then from the position of my recliner looking from the living room picture window. this morning as the light of day became obvious i realized the sky was gray and overcast. to gaze out the window from my recliner i have to look over my right shoulder. this morning i noticed from my position a light in the sky that i at first thought was a morning star. that was my immediate reaction but at the same time i knew i was wrong in my assumption. i realized it was much larger and brighter than a star, and the only object visible with the backdrop of overcast skies. i mentioned the oddity to my wife who had moved out to the couch and was lying dozing, waiting for my alarm. she refused to get up and look out the window, thinking i was trying to irritate her. i glanced at the time and it was 5:58 am by this time. my attention was back on the movie as my 6 am alarm went off. in the process of dismissing the alarm on my phone i glanced out the window and noticed the object had changed position but was still motionless. the object still had a super sized star like appearance. from my chair the object was visible at an approximate 45 degree angle. at this point i was unsure whether the object had actually moved, so in an attempt to justify reasoning i changed numerous positions in my chair to prove to myself that the object had remained stationary. it was obvious it had not. i mentioned this again to my wife, and from the couch she told me to stifle it. my attention went back to the movie momentarily, but my curiosity made me look to the object again which i realized had changed position once again. my thoughts went to air traffic. the flight path over our home runs in a east to west pattern.  there is a lot of air traffic in our area from private to commercial, and military. most recently a marine unit of ossprey aircraft landed at our airport flying just 200 feet over our rooftop. this object had no characteristics of any craft i have seen in my lifetime. my interest was peeked at this point and my wife continued her protests from the couch. two more times my attention was drawn away from the object and during these brief occasions the object changed position. i did not witness its moving and i continued to try and rationalize the situation. if i try and judge distance on a numerical scale from my position thru the glass of my window i can only surmise the change in positions to a totall of 6 inches in travel at a eastern position at an angle of 60 degrees in travel. then what occurred  next made me realize this situation may be questionable on a total different level. suddenly the star like object disappeared from sight from its last stationary position. i immediately jumped from my chair, pulled on some shorts and headed outdoors to get a better view and to locate the object. the sky was still overcast in appearance with underlying lower cloud formations and this is where things became sensational to my senses....And probably unreal to most. i witnessed a partially obscured stationary, blimp like dark, not shiny, not reflecting, no flashing lights, craft with what appeared to be a fixed appendage at the visible end of the object, on the top side. it looked like a shark fin. black in color like the blimp shape of the object. although similar to the tail section of a airliner or smaller aircraft, this sat in what i perceived as a reverse position and angled towards the obscured center of the craft or object. i can not reasonably judge the distance or the size. look at a ruler or tape and what i was able to witness was slightly less than a quarter inch in length. by the time i ran back inside and returned with a camera and phone the object was no longer visible. when i went inside to retrieve a device i glanced at the clock and the time was 6:11 am. i have not seen any objects since and the sky's remain overcast at the time of this report.

neighborhood in between casa grande and coolidge, az. the exact location, if you want to look up on a map was mira vista st. a few blocks from mary c. obrien elementary.  we observed lights and continued playing catch in the street under a street light, it was dark out, maybe 7:30-8:30 and we saw the light kept getting closer, the lights passed right over us. as it passed we thought it was an airplane formation, then we realized that it blocked out the barely visible clouds reflecting off the moon, it was hard to tell the actual shape, but it was most recognizably a triangle. myself and my sisters have spoke of it a few times regarding stuff we saw of tv and how the afb claimed it was flares. we saw these same lights about 45 miles south in the middle of the desert in a small neighborhood. it was very slow moving.(without scale) a little faster than you see an airplane pass over at high altitude... this was in between cloud cover and the floor, elevation was unknown. it made a direct pass from south to north, after it passed over we resumed to play catch. we know there is an airport south of us in eloy. it did not make a sound, absolute silence, we stood perfectly still to try and hear the engines rev, nothing at all. not really taking in what we saw as a ufo, though the word was passed around a few times. after seeing the speculations on tv a few years back, i kept thinking why is the air force lying, i figure it was a top secret aircraft. i still believe that so to this day. but with all of mufon's resources and collaborating stories, maybe you guys can nail down exactly what it was. good luck, email me with any questions you have, i'd be happy to share any info i have. i have 4 other witnesses, and my sisters might remember who else was out there with us, because i do not. this is not a claim to fame, i do not want to go on tv and look like a loon. this is just an itch i have had bothering me for a while. this was only 5 lights, one my sisters

was around 9-9:30 in the evening. i stepped out on my back porch to smoke, when....For the third time in two months, this extremely bright white light just turned on, like it was saying \"here i am\". the light cast no light on very few whispy clouds around it. as it had in the past, it stayed on for 4-5 seconds then slowly went out. i saw what looked like a cigar shaped dark figure behind the light. it was so very bright that it was hard to see past the light. there was no noise before or after and nothing around me was electrically effected. my dog was inside, so she didn't bark. like the other two times, it was approximately at a very low whispy cloud level....Maybe 400 feet up.....I'm not good with measuring above the ground, but it was much closer than a biplane would fly. it was a clear night with a few thin very low lying misty like clouds. i had only been on my porch one to two minutes before it lit up. the light is like  basketball size and completely round, but cast no light around it. this is my third encounter with this same thing. i reported it the first time and lou gagnon from va took on my case. somehow his email was gone from my phone, so i didn't know how to contact him, again. the first time that these lights appeared very low to both my mother and i. at that time it went behind another low lying cloud, to come out a total of three times. it always stays on for a slow 4-5seconds then goes off, to light up again coming out behind a low cloud, to turn on again. the second time, it was about the same height as usual and only came on once. never a sound to be heard. it's so close that the light stays on much longer than a blinking planes lights, it's also way to low.  the third time this happened, on last wednesday, i was totally caught off guard and it frightened me terribly. this feels very personal, to me, like it wants me to see it. that may sound weird, but no weirder than it coming a third time. i am baffled. i'm scared and other odd things are happening in the skies  in front of my deck, that i've never seen before. many nights,i will see what looks like a bright star, very high up and think that it's odd that it wasn't there a minute ago. the light will slowly fall and then fade out, like a flare. i've seen this a dozen times, with my elderly mom seeing it once. there has been extremely bright planes coming from the western sky.... all from the same place....That are so bright that they look like search planes. they turn to the south, as they approach my complex and then head south. it may be four at a time. there has been more, what looks like military planed, flying in twos, that i have ever seen before. in the past month, i had my cable wifi and tv updated to x1. when i downloaded the apps that everyone downloads for streaming, my google account was taken over by \"linux\". i couldn't do anything with my phone because this linux took over my google account, so my phone wouldn't recognize me. after hours of trying to get into my google account, i finally saw that that operating system had put itself as the primary owner of my phone! my device wouldn't recognize me, so i couldn't use my emails or banking app. as soon as i saw this, i took off all of the x1 apps, and low and behold, my phone was mine again. i called cable and worked my way up to the app issue department. they ran a test on my phone to match every ip address that i used on my phone, or accessed myphone. at first they said there was evidence that someone had tampered with my phone. hours later, after they checked all of my sites, they called and said that all was fine. they sent me to the security department for help, who is now researching my phone.\r\ni'm not sure if i'm paranoid, at this point, but odd things are happening. three times to see this up close \"spotlight\" with a craft behind it, is very disconcerting. i'm afraid that noone will believe me. i'm really scared of this thing coming back. noone is around when it comes on and if someone in my apartment complex has seen this, i don't know about it. i sent mr. gagnon my drawing from the first night that my mom and i saw it, together. he asked me some questions, to which i responded. somehow his email is gone and i can't reach him to discuss this new activity and extremely high flare like things...And the planes flying in groups of two, which i've never seen. the planes coming in from the west are usually about 10 minutes apart, and are so very bright that it looks as if there are several venuses in the sky.\r\ni just want to know that me and my mom are safe. i'm scared of this silent \"flood light\" thing coming on at me, when i go on my porch. my dog has woken me up several times looking out my door and growling. she doesn't behave that way. again, i may be a little paranoid after this third visit. that 3rd visit was no coincidence.... nor the second one. someone please call me so i can give youmore detailed information on what i'm seeing. thank you so much. at least i have someone to tell that may believe me, without judgement of my mental stability.... which is fine. i have been a nurse since i was 20. thanks again and

not a great view just the other building in front of us.But since we are on the top floor we do see a little of the skyline. i can only tell you  what i saw and here it goes. i was playing my game trying to get credits for a investment i wanted to go for. when i heard my fiance say \"whats that \". as i looked at him i noticed he was looking out the window. as i looked to what he was watching i noticed 4 orb's looking objects going in a counter clock wise motion. the middle of the orb was a bright white with what looked like a red orange edg to it. and it also left a very short trail at the end of it. as i said it was fadeing going in a counter clock wise motion and as it did one by one started to fade. so if you were looking at a clock it would be 12, 3 6 and 9 on a clock. i notice that as they faded that it was also going  counter clock wise. so that when number 9 disappear i jumped on a bucket we had in our room and when i did that i saw the 5th orb sitting on the bottom of the others. it disappear with number 6 and the the last one did the same . we did not hear no noice nor did we hear any planes going by us that was weird cause traffic in our area is always busy. we live

before she left for the night. we we looking in the sky when i saw three red lights in the form of a triangle, no craft was visible, but it was dark. i observed the lights in an instant begin to spin, when then gave the appearance of one large red circle, after that it darted off into the sky out of view in an instant. after that i looked to my friend and asked her if she had saw it, she said she had and described the same thing that i did. what i find interesting is that we both saw the same thing. this all happened in only about a minute an a half. hope this helps or if anyone has any questions please feel free to contact me, thanks!","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

did notice some splashing in the water near us, but my friend claimed he didn't hear it (he's very unobservant). we were sitting close to a bridge and cars were passing by. then at a moment where there were no cars, we both noticed a small yellow light hovering above the trees and began questioning what it was. soon the orb turned bright white and began to expand as it rose up on a blue beam of light. as the shape became more defined it looked exactly like a space ship from the movies. it looked like a saucer from the front with blinking blue and white lights on the bottom where i assumed the door was. it hovered for a small moment then flew over us, i could tell it had a more winged shape and it had red lights on the bottom. i could feel it's vibrations and it's energy and as it flew over my head i thought i might be abducted.I'm glad i wasn't.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Insignia,

that time, and it was a summer month. i'm 16 now, but i still remember it. i was at a birthday party at a classmate's house. it was a sleepover, and her house was in the rural area of the city. it was about 1 o'clock at night, and we were all going out to stargaze. we all laid on the trampoline, and just looked up at the sky. a couple of minutes went by, and then a flat disc-like object flew over us. the object was close enough for us to see details, like it looked that it was made of metal. i think the object may have been about 50 metres up in the air, or maybe even less. the object was flying in a straight path. it had 3 white lights, arranged in a triangle on it's underside/belly. i don't know if it was the whole object that spun, or if it were only the lights. but it spun. it made a low buzz/humming sound. it didn't flew very fast, i think the sightning lasted for about 2-4 minutes. we lost sight of it, as it flew towards the horizon. we didn't panic, we just felt puzzled. but later that night we felt a little unsettled, but i think that's normal for kids in that age. we tried to search the sky for the object a little later that night, but we didn't see it again.","distance":"21-100 Feet, Unknown","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
