fitness parking lot and to my car. i unlocked my car and put my gym bag in the back seat then got in the car and looked at the clock it's 9:58 pm. i drove through the parking lot of la fitness and the parking lot of that strip mall. i turned right into phars rd and drove toward grayson to go home. i live in loganville near snellville and grayson. \r\nat the 1st stop sign on phars rd was north rd, there were two cars were waiting for their turns, mine was the 3rd car and the last car. i looked at the lock it’s 10 pm. when i proceeded to pass that stop sign i sneezed then i felt the fiction and vibration's  noise of car's tires against the road subsided then i saw tree branches passing by my car’s window. judging from the side of their leaves they must be very close within my arm reach.  my eyes were opened widely in dismay i do not understand what was just happened then all of a sudden darkness took over.  \r\nwhen the light came back i saw the green street sign right by my eyes the sign of web gin house road. the white letter w was as big as my entire hand it must be right at my face and enlarged, it was moving upward. then i felt the fiction of the road against my tires again. i got too confused and scared i stopped at the side of the road to find where i was and wondered how i got there.  i looked at the clock it was 10:02pm.\r\ni saw the traffic light about 1000 feet ahead so i drove up to see the name of the street. i found i was at the corner of web gin house rd and hwy ga. 20.  i was in lawrenceville city. how i got there was a mystery i did not see anything, i did not know how i got there in 2 minutes and in total darkness. i drove home from there i stop at mail box to pick up my mail. \r\nat 10:24 pm. i got homes, i locked all my doors and called my sister to tell her what was just happened to me. she said i should check my body. i checked my body i saw not thing wrong with me excepted my left arm felt paint. i looked at my left arm where the paint appeared i saw the fresh mark of a wound from a  needle like i got shot from the doctor's office. i just got a shot from a needle  it’s  about 3 inches above my elbow. when i put my finger on the wound i felt its hardness underneath about 1 cm depth. this wound was not here when i put lotion on my arm at the gym.  i must just got this shot  during the darkness took over. i was very confused and i was too scared to fall to sleep.\r\n\r\nthursday 8/27/ 2015   day 2:\r\ni couldn’t sleep because i was too scared to close my eyes. \r\ni do not do drug i do not smoke and i do not hang around drug or people who do drug i can’t be hallucinated i can’t explain how i got to lawrenceville from grayson in 2 minutes and i got a shot in the left arm. \r\n\r\nfriday 8/27/ 2015   day 3:\r\ni couldn’t sleep for 72 hours because i was too scared to close my eyes but i was not sleepy at all,  physically i never felt any better, i am full of energy as i was in my twenty. i was not tired or sleepy at all but i knew i must sleep so i took  sleeping medicine to fall sleep but every time i dozed off i felt like a switch in me turned on and switched me back to awake. i stayed up for 120 hours then finally i did some catching up with my sleep. i am waiting in dreadful to find out what will happen to me from that mystery

on at all times. the object they were attached to closely resembled the shape of a skoll can. measuring maybe 20 feet across and 5-7 feet high. i wanted to park and get out. but as i pulled forward to pull into the driveway at the very same house the craft was hovering over, i began to feel fear. so i continued forward on my way. the object and lights remained visible to me for another half mile or

had a blinking white light and the other had orange-red blinking lights flashing in circular succession. once he told me about what he’d just seen, a few minutes later, i went outside and spotted a low-flying airplane going in the same direction that he’d seen the ufos fly. a few seconds after the airplane, a spinning disc-shaped craft flew overhead just above the tree tops in our front yard, hovering for a few seconds before flying in the same direction as the other aircraft. this completely silent ufo was flashing and rotating very bright orange-red and white lights in succession and appeared to be about 15 feet in diameter and came from the direction of the rising nearly-full moon and stayed in my line of vision for about a minute (as i followed it as far as i could before it flew above the forest and towards the pond. immediately after the ufo flew away, the sky suddenly became very busy with numerous aircraft all going in the same direction. one interesting aircraft that flew overhead had lights on its bottom outlining its boomerang/triangular shape. this aircraft did emit an airplane-like hum, so i’m guessing it may have been an advanced military plane. it’s interesting to note that the ny air show was taking place the next day about twenty miles from this sighting, so perhaps some of these aircraft were practicing stunts for the show. however, i did not see disc-shaped aircraft listed on the ny air show website like those that my partner and i witnessed. also interesting to note is that my friend saw an unusual brightly-lit cloud formation around the same time from queens, ny.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

this would have been late august or early september – i have slides from the trip that were processed in september 1968).  high on our agenda was climbing mt. washington on the jewell trail, which may be accessed from the base station of the famous cog railroad there.  it was a hot sunny day, some 90 degrees at the bottom of the mountain, but as we got to and above the tree line a thick fog enveloped us.  by around noon we reached the top of mt. washington, and stuck around the general vicinity for a couple of hours or so.  in mid-afternoon we started back down.\r\n\r\nwe were about halfway down (or more) the 3.7 mile long jewell trail portion (the whole hike up is nearly 6 miles), well below the tree line, when i thought i heard something from down further along the trail.  i stopped and told bill to listen, but there didn’t seem to be anything to hear after a few seconds, so we continued walking.  i recall conditions as being sunny but somewhat misty/showery; the trees around us were dwarfed (maybe 15 or 20 feet tall) and one could see perhaps 175 to 200 feet into the woods.  i don’t recall there being much if any wind.   less than thirty seconds later i again motioned to bill to stop and listen.  over the next minute or two we heard a *sound* on the right (western) side of the trail describe what appeared to be a regular trajectory parallel to the trail, and moving uphill alongside it.  we saw nothing, but estimated that whatever caused the sound, were it 200 feet from us, would have been moving at about 15 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nat its closest and loudest, the sound was very loud – as loud as a medium-sized helicopter would have been at 200 feet’s distance.  but, and most interesting, the sound itself varied not the slightest bit in pitch, tone or intensity, while otherwise sounding somewhat how a billion mosquitoes might sound – a kind of highish-pitched buzz/whine.  whatever it was, if it was something solid, it must have been on or near the ground as we most likely would have been able to see it above the trees had it been much above ground level.  it seemed rather close, rather than further away/louder/faster-moving.  again, there was no wavering of pitch and intensity such as one might expect from a huge swarm of moving insects.  it proceeded upslope, parallel to the trail, until we couldn’t hear it anymore.  the whole event only lasted at most a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nhaving no idea of what it was we stood silently as it passed, not being eager to run after it into the woods.  when it was gone we just continued down the trail, reaching the base station sometime after 4 pm, i think.  when we got there we asked the ticket person for the cog railway whether anything like this had ever been reported, and i distinctly remember him laughing and saying “oh, you must have heard a bear!”  well, i think not.\r\n\r\ntopo maps seem to show that there is nothing but sloping downhill forest to that side of the trail for about a mile, at which point the forest reaches the rather minor and unpeopled jefferson notch road at several hundred feet lower elevation.  i wrote to the forest service (or national park service—i forget which) to inquire about the event, but they were of no help.\r\n\r\nboth of us now have our ph.D.S, bill in applied psychology and myself in physical geography.  i still remember the event pretty clearly, i think, and i leave it to you folks to ponder further.  --charles h. smith\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":70084,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.3661703,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09032015-0004","longitude":-71.5509363,"occurred":-44841600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Hampshire","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,  A","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1441243019000,"summary":"In august 1968 a friend and i encountered a \"moving sound\" while hiking down the jewell trail near mt. washington, nh.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":-25399.75,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-55573,"maxtempi":-99999,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":-55573,"meantempi":-99999,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":-55573,"mintempi":-99999,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":-9999.9,"snowfallm":-25399.75,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":-25399.75,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-55573,"maxtempi":-99999,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":-55573,"meantempi":-99999,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":-55573,"mintempi":-99999,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":-9999.9,"snowfallm":-25399.75,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":17200,"locationName":"Whitefield, New Hampshire","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:9104"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Weaverville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving near weaverville nc seen four what i thought we'd hot air balloons. but as i got closer i stopped the truck and took a picture just before the one on the right shoots up and to the right.It is gone in about two seconds way to fast to be a airplane or helicopter.
