as i watched, i noticed 2 black objects coming straight down. i paused the video, it looked like 2 winged humanoids. sounds crazy. so i researched winged humanoid sightings. and came up with a video from 2005 that a rancher taped. looks exactly the same. i don't have the equipment to actually go frame by frame. so i used pause,play, pause. and this is the disturbing part.\r\ni can sremember the 2 described humanoids actually go onto the plane,and it looks like they ripped it apart at the tail section. then they came off and decended. as the decended the ships, i will call them passed,2 of them. please keep in mind that all of this happened at a blink of an eye. the naked eye can't see this. it happened at incredible speed. our military doesn't have anything that can move that fast. please look at the video frame by frame.\r\na friend of mine went to the air show the next day,and he captured 2 of the ufo ships paswing while he was filming a hariate helicopter. he didn't see the

september 1st 2015. it was evening time and around dusk so the sun was going down. as she is driving she realizes that up in the sky she sees three twinkly white lights in a large triangular pattern but very far apart from each other. as she is driving she realizes that the lights are very bright and very beautiful at the same time. almost as if its a twinkling star but it's just too bright to be an actual star. \r\n\r\nas she is driving she keeps looking up and she realizes that these lights are following her car but at the same time they aren't moving they're staying stationary and just twinkling in and out but not fading away. almost as if someone is taking a light switch and lowering the light and then making it bright again lowering the light and making it bright again.\r\n\r\nfinally after about 15 minutes of her seeing the lights one went out then two went out then finally three went out. she's looking around not understanding what's going on and it's creeping her out because she doesn't know if anybody else is seeing what she seen in the sky.  she told me she doesn't know exactly how to feel about this encounter. at first she thought the lights were absolutely beautiful and it caught her attention and after that she felt this overwhelming sense that something wasn't right and just wanted to get home and not think about it again.\r\n\r\nright after the third light went out is when she called me on the phone absolutely creeped out telling me that she knows i will be the only one that understands this since i have always been  the go to person for all things extraterrestrial  and i wouldn't judge her so she told me the whole story. she knew i wold know who to go to with this information. i told her i would do exactly what i could which was go to mufon and try to tell her story the best i can with the information she gave me.\r\n\r\nshe and i have been friends for almost 20 years. she is a very reliable person and not a lot of things freak her out she's very strong willed. always has been. so when she came to me with this and told me what happened to her in the car and i can tell on the phone that she was extremely weirded out by it. i knew that this had to be the real deal especially for her. she said to me \"i know what i saw and if nobody wants to believe me then fine but no one is going to tell me that what i saw wasn't real\". i believe her and i really hope that we find some evidence to prove her right of what she did see.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

large grassy park area which was near the niagara river. i always watched the stars and my husband was working nights. because of the park and river nearby aside from the house tops the sky line was wide open, it was about midnight in the summer, i \" think\" it was around 1970 no later then 1971 or earlier then 1966 . we lived on the second floor, had a small balcony off the bedroom with a screen door which is where i star gazed. while i looked up i saw a very odd sight which was a perfect circle of lights higher then an airplane flies or so it appeared. there had to be about 8 or 9 bright lighted objects forming this circle and looked to be equal distance apart. i was trying to figure out what constellation this could be in such a perfect circle, one i had never seen before. they remained stationary for quite a long time when all of a sudden one of the objects left this circle and the others quickly closed that gap to again be what appeared equal distance apart. within minutes this huge object appeared  to my left just above the tree tops and house tops and very slowly and silently moved about 2 houses away from me . there were huge windows all along the side of this object which appeared to be a dark dull grey. but the windows were well lit with a red glow and i could clearly see inside . there appeared to be several instrument panels but i never saw any humanoid forms or anything else for that matter. i was so awed by this that i never thought to go to the front of my place to look out the front windows to see which direction it was headed. it was like i was stuck and could not move or maybe i just didn't want to move. when i looked up again after this craft was gone that circle of lighted objects were also gone.  but here is the clincher. we did not get the daily news paper at that time  so i had no knowledge of what  was in it . the next night we went to my in laws home and my husband said tell them what you saw, so i did. with that they said didn't you read the paper and we answered no we don't get it. they then pulled out that evenings paper and there on the front page just below the fold was a picture of 2 uniformed policemen from niagara falls ny who said that they saw a ufo and it appeared to them about 10 minutes after i had seen it and what they described was very simlar to what i had seen","distance":"101-500

ortonville, mn. from a family get together in fergus falls, minn.\r\nwe turned onto highway 75 and were headed south. it was a cloudy evening and just before reaching the outskirts of fairmount, nd (a border town) i happened to look out the car window towards the west and saw this object coming out of the clouds.  it was disc shaped with a protruding bottom.  i was sure i was just seeing things so didn't say anything right a way.  \r\nthen i looked again and the object was still there but this time it dematerialized. within a second it had materialized.  finally told my husband who was driving to take a quick look and see what he thought the \"thing\" was.  he said right a way it was no airplane and had no idea what it was.\r\nwe drove a long and the object kept coming closer to us. during this time it dematerialized and materialized at least three times.  we couldn't believe what we were seeing and became quite anxious.  the children were also scared and wondered what was going on.  by now we could make out it was a silver metallic color but it made no sound. there were no lights or windows. \r\nit approached our car and for the next sixty miles it hovered above our car some times switching sides.  one minute it would be on my husband's side and the next second on my side.  we kept swerving our heads trying to see where it was going. by now we were all quite frightened and even my husband who was usually calm was agitated. he was having a time driving and still try to keep track of what was going on.\r\nas we drove down the highway we noticed some cars and even semi's were pulling over to the side of the road.  as we passed by, they pointed their fingers at the top of our car and some even honked their horns.  i remember specifically one car going by us with a woman driving.  as she went by her eyes were as big as saucers and her mouth was wide open.  she looked terrified! and i am sure we looked the same to her!\r\nas we continued our journey home cars kept pulling over, honking and pointing.  about two miles out of ortonville, the object left us and landed behind a grove of trees. i saw it land but when i looked again, it was completely gone.\r\nthe next day we mentioned what we saw to a few people.  some of them checked to find out if there were was any air traffic during the time we were there and there wasn't any.  \r\nduring the time of this happening we didn't know about ufo's but even after thirty nine years i know the exact area where i first noticed it and the exact place where it landed.\r\nwhat still bothers me is why did the ufo follow us for such a length of time? what was it after?  there was no time loss or anything that affected any of us (i don't think!)  suppose this will remain a mystery!","distance":"20 Feet or
