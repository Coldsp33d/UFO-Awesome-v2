not observe the object anymore. i researched all similar sightings i could find and the most similar to what i saw was one sighting from kassel, germany on june 26, 2014. that really looks like to

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was between the year 1977 and 1978, during the time i was a teenager, i was residing in the southeast side of houston, texas when the incident occurred; i was not into the ufo documentary stuff at that time nor believed in other worlds existing; just being a 70s teenager. one evening during the aforementioned time, it may have been anywhere between the time of 9:30pm and 10:30 pm hours, my mother told me to run down the roadway to the local store to purchase some items she had needed immediately for cooking; the store was about a half of block down the street east of my residence. i don't remember what time i had left that even exactly, however, it was at least before the local 10 o clock evening news had broadcast that night. i immediately proceeded out of my residence, onto the residential area roadway and proceeded on foot east bound to the store and crossed over a main roadway, in which the store was located. upon arrival at the store, which the walk to the store only took approximately 3 to 5 minutes from my home, i immediately purchased the items my mother requested, therefore, i was in and out the front door of the store in approximately 5 minutes, crossed over the main roadway and was on my residential street in seconds. a few minutes later, while proceeding west bound on my residential roadway and just arriving in front of my residence, something caught my attention which i found very odd that evening hour. next to my residence, west of it, there was a large open vacant lot between my residence and the next house west of mine at that time, which stretched north to the next street over, therefore, i could clearly see the next street over north from my residence. again, something odd caught my eye, i remembering observing what appeared to be some unidentified vehicle proceeding through a dark residential street west bound at a very high rate of speed, based on my current experience, it was traveling at least 70 mph in a 25 mph residential area, passing parked cars on that small roadway with no head lights on what so ever. i found that to be odd and i remember saying this to my self out loud, \"why is he driving so fast like that and no head lights!\"  seconds later, while still stunned by this vehicle's actions, something caught my attention that would haunt me for the rest of my life up to the time of this report, from out of thin air west of me over my residential roadway, this hugh ufo or some kind of craft appeared from out of thin air about a 45 degree angle of my site south of the vehicle's travel. this was not some point of light in the sky or anything, this thing was very very large, humongous hugh! it was approximately the size of a football field. at that time, frozen in fear in my tracks, i observed this object about approximately 100 feet from the roadway and approximately 100 to 125 feet from me. therefore, i was close enough to the point if i would have turned my back to the ufo and had thrown a rock at it over my shoulder, i confidently know i would have hit it; that's how close i was to it. the most frightening thing about the whole incident, that for it to be so close to me, so humongous in size that it slowly moved without making a sound; totally silent! it moved from over my street north to a north easternly direction over the open vacant lot towards the roadway of where the mysterious traveling vehicle was last seen. slowly and smoothly glided and it appeared that it was almost traveling towards me. i was so frighten and immediately panicked, thinking that who ever was operating that ufo was coming to get me. i ran up to our closed chain link fence and not sure if i leaped over it our opened it, however, afterwards, i remembering running up to the porch and frantically trying to open the closed and locked exterior aluminum glass front door, jerking on it frantically and yelling open the door. i remember my sister, who was next to me in age approaching the door from inside the living room, unlocked it and opened the door and asking me in a smart sarcastic way, like sister and brother were, \"what's wrong with you boy!\". i burst right into that living room, scared like nothing before and nothing since up to the time of this report. i remember going into the kitchen and i think my mom asked me \"where have you been and why it has it taken so long to go to the store.\" i was speechless and had yet to respond to either my sister's question nor my mom. i was to shook up to talk. a few minutes passed, still shook up from the incident and had not told anyone what i had witnessed, i proceeded to my bedroom and was casually in front of my 13 inch black and white television and the local news was broadcasting. the weather man was on the television, which was approximately 10:25 pm , sarcastically  stated that a ufo had been spotted in the houston area. my question is, was i abducted or part of a missing time incident? was the traveling vehicle in question part of all this? i have to say, i don't remember seeing any lights on this large object in question. all i can say is that it was approximately the size of a football field, shaped either chevron or rectangular. this object did not make a sound, absolutely at all; totally silent while it moved across the air! therefore, it had a high degree of technology that i have never seen before and yet up to the time of this report. it was not a blimp or any air craft i have ever seen in my life time. if that's military of the us or any country, that country would rule the world with that kind of technology; appearing out of thin air and moving across the air without sound,  compulsion or some kind of exhaust. in addition, i have had many other incidents in my life so have other family members experiencing things that violated laws of physics that were unexplained such as missing time, appearing from one location of the city to another location miles away in a blink of an eye. i wonder if this is all connected.

field 4 times as big as the one i just passed about 300 yards ahead and i could get a better look there.As i approached the next field and it came into view, i could see this bright light clearly. it was so bright it made me see in blurry double vision and squint,i said to myself this is no star its too low to bright.I pulled to the side of road shut off car to see if i could hear anything from it, i could not,i watched it  waiting for movement anything but it stayed stationary with its super bright light, then i thought of my cell phone turned and grabbed it from the dash of my car,then i had the idea of turning on my phones flash light and flashed it to see if i could get a reaction,bad idea the damn thing dimmed a little and started to move.I turned off the light, double tapped the home button for the camera to start and as, i did the light got bright again and it started moving real fast towards me too fast. i snapped pictures in succession 5 of them!\"the first being small because of the distance but at the end of the 5th pic it was almost on top of me, that\"s when i began to freak out.I just watched it come in my direction with marked anticipation,i didn't know what was going to happen,all i could see at first was the bright white light of what i assumed was the front of the craft still no noise and it was close,i could not make out a shape yet because the light was so bright,as it was almost over the top of me, and the car, a little to the left side this is where it starts to take shape kinda like a broad arrow tip, in front to a half diamond shape in the back of craft with solid exterior lights blue, red, and green.And as it flew right over me approximetly 100 to 150 feet their was a low vibrating buzz or humm, at this point my heart was racing. i was already panicked but it passed over me headed west, north west, and disappeared behind the trees on the right side of the road.This is when i made my move and got the h e double tooth pics out of their.I kept watching the sky but never caught site of it again.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

 i said to my friends \"what the heck is that?\" what we all saw was two brightly glowing orange sphere's. they were side by side with the one on the right sat just in front of the left one and overlapped it by approximately 50 to 60 percent. they were identical in height (30-35 feet high). they sat there on the water i suppose you could call it hovering so the very bottom of the sphere's just kissed the water's surface, all the while making no sound of engines or propulsion systems of any kind. what was odd was the sphere's glowed but did not cast light as to light up the area, they just seemed to glow from within. after observing for a minute or two and getting the hell scared out of us we paddled as fast as we could back to shore and almost to the shore i noticed the sphere on the right shot straight up which was immediately followed by the left one. after ascending to a few hundred feet, they both instantly shot off about 75-80 degrees to the right at a blinding speed and had completely disappeared within a few seconds. we never told our parents in fear of getting in trouble for \"borrowing\" the neighbor's boat without their knowledge. not much else for details but it happened exactly as i mentioned here.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":70014,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.670592,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-08312015-0061","longitude":-63.5549225,"occurred":-71465400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nova Scotia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1441058894000,"summary":"Witnessed 2 bright orange glowing spheres that hoverd on the lake's water surface","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Halifax","timeZoneName":"America/Halifax","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":17506,"locationName":"Dartmouth, Nova Scotia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:9445"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Lockhart","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have always been fascinated with stars as far back as i can remember. one summer night at about ten at night, i thought i would go out and look at the sky and i looked toward the south east i saw red lights in the woods. the unusual thing about these lights is they were twenty to thirty feet high. we are talking about as high as the tallest trees which were twenty to thirty feet tall. the lights took the shape of a christmas tree, from the top to the bottom, all red lights. we are talking about hundreds of lights. by the time i went and got one of my brothers, the object was gone. the object was about three to four hundred yards away. it could not be mistaken for any thing else. there was no noise or any type of electrical wires to say that some-one had hooked any lights to the trees. it is a clearing in the woods and in the middle of no where. maybe it doesn't mean anything, just thought i would share. if you are interested there are two more sighting and locations for all. this is not a story or a prank.

occurrence that had just happened.  i had been examined by beings and returned home.  this recollection gave a full understanding that this was one of many 'abductions'.  i hesitate with that term, since i didn't feel i was there against my will, and was very familiar with one of the beings, almost like an old friend.  the routine examine was completed and at some point i was walking around the ship with this 'old friend' we talked [through telepathy] and discussed many topics, some that regarded humankind and the future for us and our planet.  this discussion we had feels as if it was of great importance.  however, i cannot remember the details.  i was visited again several days later.  there were at least two different species.  there were beings that were similar to what are described as greys.  i felt a small sense of hierarchy that the taller ones were superior to the shorter ones.  not certain if they were juveniles to adults or different classes.  the second vivid memory there were hybrid like shorter beings with bright blue eyes and blond hair, the taller greys were present.  again, the 'old friend' was among the group.\r\n \r\ni am not certain why they allowed me to remember these few details of these visitations.  i feel like i need to revisit this conversation with the 'old friend' because it stressed importance.  if you would like to discuss this in greater detail i am open to conversation.  there may be many questions than can be answered.  \r\n\r\n\r\nmost recently, i had a sensation that another occurrence may happen that evening.  strange sensation that they were in the room as i prepared for bed, but i could not see anything, but felt they were present.  oddly, it felt like 'he' -the 'old friend' or familiar being was there.  the next day i felt like my left eye had been stabbed with a needle or something.  more painful than debris in my eye.  on my drive to work i became increasingly sensitive to light, to the point that a beautiful sunny day had become painful and blinding.  i did not have a headache/migraine or history of migraines and have not experienced this before.  nausea and blurred vision are also symptoms. \r\n\r\n\r\ni would be very open to regressive hypnosis to recall these occurrences and specific conversation.  i hope to have more clarity to these instances.\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you for your time and

morning, my (then) girlfriend was annoyed i hadn't come to bed on valentine's day night. so to give her space, i retired to my basement workshop for distraction. upon figuring out a final design for a forward grip replacement for an inherited israeli rifle, i stepped out side, walking up an exterior stair case from my basement to back yard, for a cigarette. it was a chilly morning, somewhere between 28° and 36° fahrenheit according to the weather underground's almanac. i was distracted spray painting metal pieces on my back porch, facing the house, when the distant chop of helicopter blades became audible. since the michael brown riots helicopters are common place all night. even at this time however, we were in a direct departure path from lambert international airport, and commonly overflown by life flight, police, and news choppers, as well as the occasional more exotic military aircraft. we live close to scott air force base, and close enough to whiteman afb that a ch-47, uh-60, or even occasional fighter isn't uncommon. certainly not enough to raise concern. i have seen lockheed f117 nighthawks, tankers, and cargo planes perhaps on the order of one each, every 18 months. i have also been overflown by a squadron of a-10 thunderbolts, screaming across lake of the ozarks at about 100 feet off the deck. this night, after a few moments of sound, an \"aerial convoy\" came visible low above the horizon, to the south, much closer than the propeller sound i heard indicated. i have family in the nga and at a family day saw one come in, land, and depart. the flight group made little noise, and what i did hear only accounted for two of the aircraft. fore and aft were uh60 blackhawk helicopters. they had only green lights visible to me, north of aircraft, as it traveled east to west across the sky to my south. almost every military flight i've seen from here was to the north and traveling east. between the two blackhawks was a black craft reminiscent of a combination of a swept wing f22-like concept and a f117 stealth fighter. it made no noise audible over helicopters, and would have had to have been max throttle to not fall from sky. the plane had a vertical stabilizer, but no anti collision beacon/strobe. it had no navigation lights either, limiting any illumination of the fuselage. no windows were visible, but that's not to say it wasn't there. the plane was geometrically comparable do to proximity to the uh60s. it was marginally longer than the 65' helos, at maybe 75 feet long. beneath the fuselage was a radiant heat distortion akin to hot pavement on a summer day. this presented as a translucent, slightly light-refracting haze. when i dipped inside to grab my binoculars, i pulled my phone off the charger for its camera. it was at about 17%. i scanned the craft for insignia but neither type had any. i took out my phone and opened the camera app, at which point the phone rebooted twice and died. the battery has never quite been the same. i feel any jet turbine engine would be far below alpha max speed traveling at under 75 miles an hour, and would inevitably stall. two sac flight mechanics i spoke to emphatically agreed, assuming i hadn't just seen an f-35 but circumstances make a hovering billion dollar plane over south saint louis seem unlikely. it was suggested that maybe i keep this to myself. even though i believe this to be secret usaf merchandise, i think it suggests capabilities often associated with ufos. i'm no skeptic, but in my case i report this to perhaps rule out extraneous sightings of earth-borne tech.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line
