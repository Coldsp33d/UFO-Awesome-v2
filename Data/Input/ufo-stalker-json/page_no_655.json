was flying back into the same area and encountered a saucer shaped ufo that entered on a collision course with me and i came within a few feet of it before it disappeared.  there definitely is a

posted a cell phone picture of it and asked if anyone else has seen it. they described it as a silver disc going slowly across the sky. a few people said they see the same thing. i started commenting on how i have seen so many ufo's here in the county. i was looking off my deck and could not find it. i put a comment asking that if anyone sees it again to please message me as soon as possible. a guy that was approximately 30 miles away in vail said he could see it hovering above the gore range. he then posted a picture with his cell phone. i got in my car with my infrared camera and drove a bit faster than the speed limit to get there, i cut the time down to get there to 25 minutes. when i first saw it i was in my car on i-70 going towards vail. i sped a little faster. as he said it was just hovering there while clouds went past it. i pulled off the highway to east vail and parked in a parking structure on the side of the highway. i was very excited to finally get my first video. i just parked my car no parking zone to get my tripod and camera set up to start recording. i got it all set up and started recording then parked my car in an actual parking space. luckily i went illegally over the speed limit because i was only able to capture the last 2 minutes it was visible before it got covered by dense clouds. now that i look at the ufo's that were on the news in breckenridge, they are very similar. i look forward to helping in any way. i believe it is kind of my mission to expose what is really going on.\r\n\r\ni have also had a lot of other experiences that we could talk about. my very first experience that i remember was on the night of my 13th birthday. my friends and i were camping alone in our front yard in hamburg, michigan. i was young and did not think much of even knowing it was a ufo. i remember seeing 4 red lights on the top and bottom and around 6 green lights sandwiched in between the red lights. it was the closest one i have ever seen. i remember going to sleep and it was still just hovering out in this field. the object i saw when i was 22 was when it got really weird. i won't go completely into it right now but it came to me and we communicated with each other for over a month every night. this being was more malevolent that i would have liked. this event had a severe impact on me mentally and consciously. in the beginning it was absolutely horrifying to say the least but now that some time has gone past i believe it has actually helped me quite a bit. if you want to know more please just ask, i would love to get this story out and help in any way possible. it would take a very long time to describe all that has happened, would prefer to talk. i am moving away from colorado in the beginning of october though for at least 6 months so anytime before that or possibly after the 6 months if we have to.\r\nthanks for listening!","distance":"501 Feet - 1

this night and was woken because my arm was hanging over side of bed and something was \"stroking my hand\". i awoke and thought it was odd my cat would be awake and rubbing up against my hand at this time of night. i turned my head and this \"thing\" with huge blue eyes was so close to my face that i could feel her nose touching mine. i was terrified. i whipped my hand out of hers and sat straight up in bed and screamed at her \"what do you want!' within seconds she glided up from her lying down position (she had been laying long wise with her legs straight out and her head propped on her bent \"elbow\". and she just kinda \"glided\" her whole body up to a standing position. she looked at me the whole time but then turned and started \"walking away\" - although her \"feet\" never touched the ground - she was like walking / hovering about an inch above the ground. but as she started leaving, i realized i was scared at all and actually felt a warm \"love-like\" feeling. and i truly couldn't believe this \"thing\" was not going to say or do anything but leave. it kinda baffled me so i said \"wait! why are you here?!\" she stopped at the foot of my bed and turned to look right at me. \r\n\r\n[this is when i was really able to evaluate her - she had long skinny legs, long skinny arms, long skinning fingers / hands, skinny body and although she had no defining \"parts\" somehow i had this clear sense that it was \"female\" - i dont know why; huge eyes (they had a big blue iris)and a tiny tiny little pointy nose  - she did \"look\" like the form of pictures of aliens i have seen but her head was normal sized and she was this absolutely beautiful glowing blue color - like the color of those little lights at the airport but more clear? pure? not sure how to describe it. this blue glow reflected onto the wall on the side she was closest too and the ceiling above her, but not in front of her or onto my bed. but the glow felt \"warm\". the other thing that really stood out to me as i thought about it was that this \"being\" didnt seem to be \"highly intelligent\" as i had always heard and assumed. when i looked into her eyes it was as if i was looking into the eyes of a big golden lab - not stupid but not super intelligent - more like looking into the eyes of a loving, loyal dog]\r\n\r\nnow as i asked her this question, she stared at me and didnt talk, but i could \"hear\" everything she was saying in my head but she didnt say much. she just looked at me with these big beautiful eyes and said \"sorry, gotta go!\", and she turned and hover-walked down the hall. i remember i could see the blue glow reflecting onto the sides of the hall as she walked down it - and then she turned to the left, which was really odd (i had two doors to the outside - one to the right that went out to the front, which is the way everyone came and left and one to the back, which went to a little excluded backyard that no one ever used - she turned to the door to the left out to the backyard - i saw her walk to it and then poof! she was gone and so was the blue light and the warmth (this was a basement apartment) i never heard a door open or close so it was like she just walked through it. \r\n\r\nas i sat there stunned, i looked around to see my cat still curled in a ball sound asleep - she had never woken. i thought to my self  - was i dreaming? and decided to pinch myself in the arm - and it hurt and then my pet cat, woke briefly and then put her head down like she was exhausted. i just couldnt stop staring at the door / area where the blue lady had left - i almost expected her to come back but she never did. \r\n\r\ni dont know why she came to me but i did snap out of that depression the next morning and went on with life but i have never forgotten her. that was 21 years ago. \r\n\r\nwhat i would like to know is has anyone had positive experiences with these beings like i did and has anyone ever seen anything like the being i did - glowing blue lady? believe me, i was absolutely terrified when i first woke and saw her but then i just felt all this \"love\". is there anyone out there that experienced something like i did? anyone? i know my experience sounds \"crazy\" but i also am absolutely certain it was real. no doubts at all. \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My family and i were staying at the edgewood resort in alexandria bay, ny. at approx. 9:45 pm on saturday 8/29 i had left one guest room and was heading back to mine, and decided to walk from our building to the main building to get a bottle of water. the main building was east and slightly south of the building we were staying in.\r\n\r\nwhile walking to the main building i noticed a bright red light in the sky to the ne. it was brighter than a star, and appeared as slightly larger than a point, possibly circular or spherical. it seemed to flicker or pulsate very slightly. by its appearance i thought that it was fairly close, maybe a mile or so away. it was moving very slowly to the north when i first noticed it.\r\n\r\nmy first impulse upon seeing it was that it was possibly a low flying airplane fairly close by, however it was quickly apparent that this wasn't a plane or helicopter. there were no additional lights, and this one red light was brighter and more substantial than the typical appearance of the light on an airplane. \r\n\r\nas mentioned, the light also had a slight flickering or pulsating appearance, so my second assessment was that maybe this was a military flare of some sort, particularly given the close proximity of fort drum. i stopped to look at it for a moment and ponder that possibility, but a couple of things about the object made me doubt that it was a flare. first, it had been moving slowly north since i first noticed it, but soon after i stopped to look more closely it became completely stationary and maintained the same altitude that it had when i first saw it. i made it a point to find a light pole to use as a stable frame of reference, and verified that the object remained stationary for at least two minutes. second, i have seen military flares on various occasions, and there was no sign of smoke around this, or of a parachute above it, no sign of sparks, etc. and i have never seen a flare remain so perfectly stationary. third (though this was determined after the sighting was over) the object appeared to the ne of my position, and fort drum was se or even s of my position, so if this was related to a fort drum maneuver it was taking place well outside of the fort drum perimeter. \r\n\r\nat this point i felt a bit excited about seeing this, and thought about going back to get someone in my family to take a look. before i did that, i wanted to make sure that this wasn't possibly a light on a tower or antenna of some sort, so i walked around behind a tree and the main building to get a view of what was beyond. there were no structures beyond that were tall enough to account for this, and none of the structures had bright lights on them. when i walked around back to my original location and looked up, the object/light was gone. i moved around again to various different viewing locations/angles but there was no sign whatsoever of the light. the time between when i had looked away and then looked back to see that it was gone was no more than 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nin conclusion, i admit that i am something of a ufo enthusiast, but i am also skeptical and inquisitive by nature. i am not the kind of person who sees an airplane at night and immediately thinks i am witnessing an alien invasion. i spend a decent amount of time looking up at the night sky, so i know what various commercial and military aircraft look like, what satellites and orbiting spacecraft look like, how to recognize various astronomical objects, etc. this particular sighting was out of the norm enough to get my attention, and doesn't seem to match anything mundane enough to where i would say with any certainty that i could explain it. of all the possible explanations, i would say that it most closely resembled some kind of flare, with the exceptions noted above. i would definitely be interested in knowing if anyone else reported this, since this was pretty early on an active night in a fairly popular resort town, and this was definitely bright enough and near enough to where i would expect someone else to have seen it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

ellington.\r\n\r\nmy point of view was framed by a rooftop and two large trees that formed a large upside down triangular window.  the cloud condition was low clouds illuminated by ambient surface lighting.\r\n\r\nanother low flyover, three now. while looking at the sky, against the night lighted clouds, i saw a craft that was almost transparent against the clouds. it's apparent underside was exposed to meet and there were what app reared to a row of three to four lights on each 'wing' that were almost as transparent as the craft itself.  it was like looking at a giant 'greater than' sign in the sky.  it was casually moving north-northeast and was in my viewing angle for maybe 5 impressionable seconds.\r\n\r\ni stood still for several minutes to try to process what i have seen.  i've seen strange glowing lights in sky over my lifetime, but never did i ever imagine that i'd see an actual craft.\r\n\r\ni am seriously hoping that someone else has filed a similar report on this night

story. i have had an alien contact.\r\none night back in the fall of 1991, my wife at the time & i heard a loud humming noise outside of our bedroom. there was a very bright light that made it very difficult to see out the window.  then within about a minute or two the noise stopped and the light disappeared.  we thought it may have been a police helicopter shinning it's light looking for someone.  but, the next day my mother in law who lived about 2 miles away, said she also heard a loud humming noise and saw some bright lights, but never heard a helicopter sound or heard about any activity with the police. very strange, so we all just let it go at the time.\r\n\r\nthen about two weeks later, one night, i couldn't sleep, so i went into the living room and fell asleep in my recliner.  i was awakened by some shuffling noise or movement sounds behind me down the hallway back near the bedrooms.  i looked at the digital clock on my stereo near the television and saw that it was 4:35 am. i knew i was awake! i said \"what the\" and all of a sudden, i heard footsteps running toward me from behind down the hallway.  i was about to get out of my chair when this being ran by me, tapped me on the elbow and continued to run past me and turned left into another room out of my sight.\r\nthis being was about 3-4 feet in height, dark in color, with a narrow body, skinny dangly arms and fingers and it's feet were both pointed outward and appeared to be clumsy.  i was frozen in my chair and couldn't move. looking at the clock, it was now 4:36 am.  i tried to release the handle on the recliner and couldn't.  i finally yelled and pulled up on the release and i was on my feet. it is now 4:37 am and i started toward the room which was our den that had a sliding glass door.  our dog was lying on the outside and of course the door was still locked.  i flipped the light switch on, looked around the room and found nothing.  i then looked back at the clock which was now 4:38 am.  i yelled for my wife, she came running and i told her there was something in the house.  she then turned on the other lights and started looking and asked what are we looking for. the time was now 4:40 am. when i described what i saw, that was it, she thought i lost it and told me to go back to bed.  of course, she didn't believe me.\r\n\r\ni don't know how it got into the house or out. i just know it scared the hell out of me. i talked with some people in paso robles later that week about strange ufo sightings that were in our area and was told that camp roberts which is a nearby military facility has been conducting secret operations for some time.\r\n\r\ni was introduced to some people at a private residence that also have had ufo experiences. i told my story and was asked if the being was a dark grey or light grey.  i described it to the best of my knowledge what it looked like and was told the light greys were good and the dark greys were bad.  i never saw those people again and have hardly ever spoken about this in fear people would think i'm crazy or i imagined it.  i have told family members and a few close friends.  most now believe me! \r\ni didn't ever know who to report this to that would take me serious.\r\nafter watching your program on the history channel, and after almost 25 years, i believe now is the time.  thank you for listening to my

obstructed from about 9 to 12 as seen on the face of a clock. from 12 to 3,the view would have been blocked by large leafy trees at that time. the weather was nice with clear skies and no wind. \r\n\r\ni have no idea why i was watching the sky, but suddenly a ring of fire appeared, moving across the sky at an enormous rate of speed. it was very high,not oversized, yet a very visible reddish orange fire ring. total time of visibility maybe 1 to 2 seconds. the speed of the object was so fast it moved almost across my view in that amount of time.\r\n\r\ni believe the object appeared and disappeared as i watched the sky, unlike coming out from the tree foliage and disappearing on the horizon. from my perspective, the actual ring had some width,\"hollow\" in the middle, and just a little longated as opposed to a perfect circle.\r\n\r\nthe only person i reported it to was my elementary teacher. her reply: \"oh,it was probably a weather balloon \". i didn't know anything about weather balloons at age nine; however, i did not believe her. she wasn't interested and quickly dismissed my observation.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

paralyzed.  there was a humming sound and i felt like the air was pulsating around me.  i desperately tried to move, to cry out to my husband.  i couldn't do either.  i felt panicked and sick.  a sense of dread fell over me and i knew i wasn't alone.  my eyes were still able to move and i glanced to my left.  inches from my face was a dark object.  it almost seemed like a floating head.  i couldn't get a good look because i was immobilized and it was approximately 2am and pitch black in my room.  nevertheless, i saw the outline of a head.  even though it was dark, i could clearly see the shape of it and noticed large black eyes.  there almost seemed to be an aura around it which enabled me to see it, but i wouldn't go so far as to call it a light.  it didn't make any sense to me at all, but i knew it was alien and that it meant to cause me harm.  i was frantic, but couldn't move or scream.  i did the only thing i could think of.  spoke to it in my mind.  it never answered back.  i just kept thinking, \"you are not welcome here!  go away and never come back!\"  i kept screaming it in my mind over and over again.  finally, after what felt like a lifetime (probably only a minute or so), the being disappeared.  the sense of dread went away and i could move again.  i was completely in shock.  i looked out my window, but didn't see anything unusual.  i started crying, checked on my husband and our 4 year old daughter, and eventually got back in bed.  i knew that it was over, but was too shaken to fall asleep again.  i felt foolish.  it must have been a dream... but it wasn't.  there is no doubt in my mind that it happened.  i've never told a single soul.  who would believe me after all?  then, i was watching ancient aliens tonight and hangar 1 came on after.  there was a story about a woman who also reported the feeling of being paralyzed during an encounter.  i've never heard of it happening to anyone else before and i felt less alone when i heard her story.  so, i felt compelled to share mine as well in case it might help someone else.
