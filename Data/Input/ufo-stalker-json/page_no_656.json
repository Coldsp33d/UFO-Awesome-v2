my mother and me home. my mother set me up at the kitchen table with a bowl of cereal. the kitchen was in the back of the house. she went out the back door to the garage where the washing machine was located. this was right outside the kitchen door. she was only out there long enough to switch the laundry around and came back inside. \r\n\r\nwhen she entered the kitchen, i was not there. my cereal and her ashtray were overturned. she had heard nothing. the front door and all windows were locked. she would have noticed if someone took me out the back door. i was nowhere in the house. \r\n\r\nthe neighbors searched our house, and their houses. my dad came home and searched everywhere, including cabinets i could not fit into. this was a 900 square foot house and it was not like me to hide. the police were called and they also searched the house and neighborhood.\r\n\r\nhours later, with mobs of people surrounding the outside of my house, they saw me through the door window and i was inside the house looking out. there was no way that i had been in there! the police asked me where i was. i told them that i was with my uncle. my uncle had been at work all day with many

navy. my wake/sleep hours were off having recently been stationed aboard the uss wisconsin during desert shield/desert storm operations.\r\n\r\ni was outside my parents house, listening to music on my car radio.\r\n\r\nto the west of the house, about 100 yards away is our towns lumber yard. i noticed, because i look at the stars often, two equally bright white lights, which i assumed were stars, just above the roof of one of the buildings of the lumber yard. i didn't think much of them, other than noticing that they were both an equal height above the roof of this building. \r\n\r\nlooking back in that direction a few minutes later, it seemed that these two lights had moved further apart. at first i figured i was imagining it. the more i looked back however, the more the distance between the two lights seemed to grow. because of this, i starting watching continuously. \r\n\r\nwithin a few more minutes, it was clear that these two lights did in fact appear to be moving further apart, but not up. i got a little nervous when the lights seemed to be getting closer to where i was standing in the street next to my car. \r\n\r\nin a couple more minutes, the lights were almost directly over-head and there was no sound at all. i would say it seemed to be moving across the sky above me at about 10 miles an hour, tops. \r\ni got nervous about what i was seeing, and climbed inside my car and shut of the radio. the car i was driving at the time was a 68 mustang, in which the previous owner had installed a sunroof. i watched thru this sunroof as the craft continued to pass over-head, still not making a sound. if i had been a little more brave, and had had a flash-light, i am convinced that i would have been able to shine a beam of light onto the object. \r\n\r\ni could not see any color or really even the shape of the craft aside from a few lights. \r\n\r\nas stated earlier, there were two lights on the front of this object. (i say front meaning the end of the object that approached my first.) in the middle of this object, was a v shape consisting of 5-7 red lights which rotated in a clockwise direction, pivoting on a center red light.\r\n\r\ni sat, silently inside my car and watched as it slowly moved across the sky directly above myself and the car,without making a sound, through my neighborhood.\r\n\r\nbefore i got into my car, i could see that there was only 1 white light at the tail end of the object, however, upon discussing this encounter later with a friend, it was brought to my attention, that although i remember rushing into my parents house once the craft was gone to awaken my mother and tell her about what i just witnessed, i didn't, and still don't, actually remember seeing the back end of the craft after i had gotten into the car.  meaning i don't actually remember seeing it moving away, i just remember thinking. \"okay, it's gone. it's safe to get out of the car and hurry inside the house.\r\n\r\nif i were to estimate the size of the object, i would say it was about the length of a football field and, and the front, at least as wide.","distance":"101-500

met, only two remained and travelled north from view in approximately three seconds. there was lower haze at the horizon and objects only were visible directly overhead to maybe 20 degrees of zenith.  totally dismissed them as satellites but, was alarmed enough to ask if anyone saw the same since i had pointed out the initial three satellites to anyone around me.  my daughter was the only one to acknowledge the lights but, did not elaborate til nearly a year later.  basically, just confirmed that there were lights traveling south to north in a line. don't know and didn't prompt her for more

over long island on that date (can't remember exactly) with no results.  still think it's an unlikely crossing of satellites in an elliptical orbit and i saw them appear as a more cohesive unit.  i

were about the 6th or 7th car waiting. to my right was a big flower nursery. when we were waiting i seen it first. the ufo looked like a teardrop shape, was chrome looking and hovering back and forth for around 10 mins or more. i told my mother look its a ufo! she said oh my gosh! the crazy thing was, was that nobody honked their horn or drove away. we are in ny, come one now we honk horns for any little thing and no one honked there horn or drove away. everyone was in aww looking at it. it was maybe around 500 feet away and right above the tree line. pretty much right above the rail road track. then after awhile it zig zagged extremely fast . way faster then any of our jets could fly. i also have many years of military experience and know we don't have anything like that is our military. its hard to remember but i thought it might have changed shapes a little to but i'm not 100% sure. it was almost 30 years ago. me and my mother both remember it. me and my brother also seen other ufo's at our old house but it was out in space. it looked like stars were chasing each our doing sharp angles. we both still remember that. i don't know if this has anything to do with it but my

my son, chris. we were both leaning up against my truck, looking at the skyline to the east. i made a comment that it was a strange night, he said i know i saw some strange thing earlier, neither of us commented, but just started looking up into the skyline. earlier i had seen airplanes to the north (lax flight path about 15 miles away). we were looking up and saw two sets of crafts flying across out of the clouds from the southeast. it was hard to make the objects out they were translucent (not see thru)just very light almost matching the cloud color. the objects were moving slowly in formation, to the left were 7 round objects with the leading object (in a \"v\" formation) pointing the tip to the northeast, they would be about the size of a watch battery at arms length. beside the v were 4 more round objects, same in color and size, flying in a straight line. when the objects were passing directly over head, the 4 on the right in a straight line made a \"s\" pattern and then resumed into a straight line. they continued to fly past the front of our home and back into the clouds still traveling north west (towards santa monica and coast). this was my first up close sighting. i took the \"s\" pattern as a communication, i said to my adult son, they are saying hello, wave back and we both did. personally, i have been trained by a paranormal investigation team for 4 years, i know how to internally dissect for information and debunking. my skeptic side of my brain had questioned, \"it's a flock of birds\", my instinct was to place values of what i observed.\r\n1. flock of birds: nighttime, no place for light reflection, height above where birds normally fly, objects too large, flight pattern was not irregular.\r\n2. observed no airplanes or helicopters in area to compare with. this is unusual since we live to the southeast of the lax flight path. planes usually fly to the direct northwest out of lax or in a straight line on the north side, or they follow the coast keeping to the south of our house. this one chose to fly directly over our house.\r\n3. the round flat objects had no lights that were colored, blinking, search lights or patterns of any kind. they stayed one color very light almost blending in with the cloud color. if you didn't stare or were directly looking for them you would not have noticed them. this rules out planes and helicopters. \r\n4. goodyear blimp, resides in carson on the north side of the 405 fwy, i suppose many a drunk person at the home depot center would have sworn it was a ufo. the blimp was not out that night, it is large, football shaped, flies very low and has advertisement and multi-colored blinking lights. i have observed the goodyear blimp for 39 years. it wasn't the blimp.\r\n5. there was no sound, no engines.\r\nin conclusion, i ruled out much of what i could to determine this was not man made for commercial or law enforcement use, as i see multitudes of aircraft in the area for such purposes. at first i thought maybe the government would have use for such aircraft, but i leaned towards it still did not seem a military invention. i also felt the wavy s pattern and the direct path over our house, was in direct communication for both of us. which would not at all surprise me. i grew up as a experiencer and taught my son from 8 years old what ufo's were and that we keep it between ourselves. i believe it was extraterrestrial and it was meant to be seen by both of us. this was a positive experience. i was in touch with someone by email regarding this but didn't know if i had sent out a report to mufon, i checked the website and couldn't find a case file for my report previously if it was submitted.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

vehicles in front of me.\r\ni have traveled that route many times and after that event seeing jetliners and for scale purposes this ufo had to be what seemed 4 or 5 times the size of a jetliner. i noticed a not so much a cigar shape but  this pure white rectangular object moving seeming slowly across my windshield from east to west. by the time it reached the other side of my windshield it was over mt. baldy mountains or somewhere close to that location. it then stopped and then went from a horizontal to a vertical position and then in a instant this ufo descended straight down in a flash that lit the whole sky and mountains like it was noon straight up. there was no sound or smoke just nothing. like it never happened. i didn't notice that the other vehicles had seen the same event until we all stopped at the intersection of baseline and padua. we all got out of our cars and we discussed for a bit but we did not exchange names or no's. i really kick myself in the but for not getting names or numbers. but i guarentee you they are as obsessed as i have been. i'm sure they will never forget what we saw. i would like to be hypnotized to go back to that event. as soon as i got home i immediatly called cable airport and after no help there i tried ontario airport but got no help they suggested i call the nearest air force base of which i did... they took a statement and said they would call me if they had any questions.  since it was christmas vacation, i worked at friedman's microwave ovens during the week.The next day while taking out the trash at friedman's i noticed all these planes taking off from cable airport and helicopters up in that area. i checked the news, the newspaper everything i could possibly check at that time. there are not to many days that go by

this one chose to fly directly over our house.\r\n3. the round flat objects had no lights that were colored, blinking, search lights or patterns of any kind. they stayed one color very light almost blending in with the cloud color. if you didn't stare or were directly looking for them you would not have noticed them. this rules out planes and helicopters. \r\n4. goodyear blimp, resides in carson on the north side of the 405 fwy, i suppose many a drunk person at the home depot center would have sworn it was a ufo. the blimp was not out that night, it is large, football shaped, flies very low and has advertisement and multi-colored blinking lights. i have observed the goodyear blimp for 39 years. it wasn't the blimp.\r\n5. there was no sound, no engines.\r\nin conclusion, i ruled out much of what i could to determine this was not man made for commercial or law enforcement use, as i see multitudes of aircraft in the area for such purposes. at first i thought maybe the government would have use for such aircraft, but i leaned towards it still did not seem a military invention. i also felt the wavy s pattern and the direct path over our house, was in direct communication for both of us. which would not at all surprise me. i grew up as a experiencer and taught my son from 8 years old what ufo's were and that we keep it between ourselves. i believe it was extraterrestrial and it was meant to be seen by both of us. this was a positive experience. i was in touch with someone by email regarding this but didn't know if i had sent out a report to mufon, i checked the website and couldn't find a case file for my report previously if it was submitted.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

persiod meteor shower. it was a clear starry night. i'm 54 years old, sane and sober. i was staring up at the sky, not seeing any meteors and just relaxing. there's no roof on my porch, it's like a deck. suddenly over my right shoulder, and over my house, i see two very dark objects moving silently over my street, then over the houses across the street and then disappearing into the nw. when i first saw them i said \"what the h--- is that?\" my wife, who has bad night vision, couldn't see what i was pointing at. the objects were very dark, almost silouettes. they blocked out the stars as they passed, that's why i knew i wasn't seeing things. i couldn't figure out how high up they were or how big they were. one instant i thought they were kites or something but i knew they weren't as i watched them move across the sky. they were triangle shape when the were directly overhead but the they 'flattend out' as they moved off into the distance. i tried really hard to get my wife to see them but they were so hard to see she never looked in the right place. as they moved off to the nw, maybe twenty seconds or so had passed and i told my wife \"you can still see them!\" but to no avail. they disappeared.\r\nas soon as i saw them i had a creepy feeling, like these things were not meant to be seen. i can't explain it, but that's the thought that ran through my head. i didn't think about 'aliens' or 'extraterrestrials' but i knew i had never seen anything like it, and for some reason, i believe i never will again. they were completely silent and had no lights whatsoever, but they did have some king of design on them. like i mentioned, there were two of them but they moved in such unison that when i first saw them my mind was trying to process them as on object, but after a second or two i saw that they were not connected. i drew a picture of what i saw and will include it. i'm an illustrator and have extensive experience in photo-retouching, if you wonder about the image. i can reproduce what i saw very well and the image is as close as i can remember. i sat on my porch and took a picture, and then drew the crafts in on my computer.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

witnessed a triangle shaped ufo, hovering approximately 500 to 1000 feet off the ground, it was silver and very shiny; it had no windows and no visible seams. the ufo was approximately 300 feet wide, after several minutes it slowly turned to the north and dissapeared. from that day forward i have been taking pictures and videos of the sky both during the day and night; i am amazed at how much activity there is here, i have posted many images and several videos on facebook, google+ and youtube. the first video i posted is my most prized video, it is one taken at dusk, there are a few small dark rain clouds around above my home and there was one very large very black cloud. in my video you can see a very large black ufo flying into the black cloud, because it is still somewhat light out there is still a blue hue behind this big black cloud. the ufo flies in on the bottom right of the cloud then through the length of the cloud and out the left side of the cloud, it flies out of view for a minute then comes back flying back into the cloud, there was a second smaller ufo behind the first large ufo. as the two ufos fly through the length of this cloud i noticed movement above the two ufos i zoomed the video in and saw there were 4 more ufos slowly moving around in the upper left corner of this huge black cloud, also as the two ufos were flying back through the cloud you can see a huge white orb flying in front of the two ufos. i have a second video, a night video. in the second video you can see a huge ufo flying with a cluster of dark storm clouds, this ufo is using the clouds as cover but at a point it is completely exposed and very visible, i taped the ufo event for several minutes then switched my smartphone to take still photos. i have several hundred pictures and several videos of a lot of ufo activity in my area. i would love to share my evidence and experience's with the mufon team, my husband (a retired marine) age 71 and myself age 43 are very fortunate and excited to speak with you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

of choppers flying a few minutes before siting the ufo but they left and at the time i did not think to much about it. i just happened to look up into the sky almost right above us and seen it barely moving and it came to a stop almost at once. i reconized what it was from telivision but this one looked a little diferent from the ones on tv.  \r\n   it had a white round top about ten feet tall and 30 to 40 foot long. it also had rather large square windows that looked to go all the way around.\r\nthe bottom was a mid grey color with round edges about 75 to 80 feet long.\r\n   i told everyone what i was seeing and for some reason only my brother-in-law looked up to see it and calmly said yes it is and never looked again. i tried to get my wife and sister-in-law to look several times and they never did wich to this day my wife does not understand why she didnt look.It was a lot closer than any i have seen on tv and a lot larger.\r\n   i watched it for about 4 to 5 minutes and remembered i had glasses to get a lot better look so i tried to reach to where they were but had to turn my head for only a second or two and looked up and it was gone. there were no clouds at all in the sky ind it just disapeared. somehow looking at it felt normal and the only thing that bothered me was my family would not turn to look.\r\n  a stranger part is a few days later i saw it again the same angle only somewhat higer at my home. i dont remember how long i stood there watching it but all at once it just slowly kind of just faded till it was gone. i dont want to sound like a nut but ever since then where i was standing wile watching it has a ring af grass that is taller than the center and outside of the ring. whenever i mow the lawn for a few days it is there every time seems to grow longer and darker. again i was very calm the whole time and dont get why.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:04:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s),

Fort","country":"TT","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was new years night, a little after midnight and my wife and i were in our front yard watching the fireworks when my eye fell on a steady light coming towards us. in my opinion the object had a very high speed, because to me it seemed to be at a high altitude.\r\nhowever, my wife was of the opinion that it was a chinese lantern due to the new year celebrations and fireworks, but chinese lanterns do not emit bright steady light, and/or follow a steady or fixed path at that speed. more so because there was no wind.\r\nbefore i got my phone out of my pocket and had it in filming mode the object disappeared, like someone flicked a light switch.\r\n\r\nhowever, a couple minutes later i saw an exact same light following the same path, and this time as i had my phone still in my hand and was able to film it until also this one disappeared the same way and about the same spot.\r\n\r\ninitially i thought it was an over passing satellite which i have seen a few times before, but then i realized it was too bright and most likely not high enough to be a satellite.\r\n\r\nboth object(s) appeared individually. the second one a few minutes after the first one disappeared. both were flying from the east to the south-west, and it looked as if the second one was following the exact same path as the first one.\r\neven though there were firecrackers going off and cars were passing by as we live on a main road, i did not notice any sound from the objects.\r\n\r\nit is important to note that we live far from an airport and at no time there are overflying planes here. not even the the high altitude commercial planes leaving those white trails behind them. you never see those here. once in a while a low overflying coast guard helicopter, but they are very obvious.\r\nalso visible overflying satellites are very rare here and are not as bright as the object.\r\n\r\nwhen i realized this was something out of the ordinary, i got excited and got goosebumps at the same time. also a surreal feeling.\r\nhowever, i could not believe that my wife was convinced it was fireworks or a chinese lantern. even if it was some sort of firework, it definitely was not a chinese lantern.\r\n\r\n\r\nmaybe it might also be interesting to mention that a few months prior to the above observation, my wife was in the front yard around 9 - 9:30 pm to when she knocked on the window to come and see something. when i reached her i was just in time to see a small round orange object which flew away and disappeared in the distance. \r\nhowever, according my wife from her point of view it was as large as a (soccer) foot ball, moving very erratically, then hovered for a few seconds over a house in the distance and when i reached it was flying away at very high speed and disappeared.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
