my friend ordered cheese steaks at a pizzeria that is less than two blocks away. i stayed and watched the game as she went to get the food. as she was walking down orianna street (right off girard ave)going to cambridge street where she lives, she looked up in the sky and saw three white rectangles. there was a moon in the daytime sky, although the sun was very close to setting, and to the left of the moon were these three white rectangles. she was walking carrying the food and looking at them, she stopped briefly and moved to the side to see if maybe somehow they were being created by a reflection (she didn't think they were, but had no idea what she was seeing). after realizing that they were indeed in the sky she rushed down the rest of the block and got me. she came in and said \"come outside! i want you to see something in the street!\" i got right up (this was unlike her, she wasn't screaming but she was slightly urgent) and she told me to put on my shoes but i told her its ok...So i went out without my shoes which really isn't a good idea in the city. i thought we were gonna look at something in the street, not in the sky. she took me halfway down the block and was soooo disappointed \"theyre gone!\" she said. i asked her what and she described seeing three white rectangles in the sky off to the left of the moon and said that they were just there. they weren't moving or anything. so i got as much information as i could from her and recreated a photo to show everyone what she saw. the recreation is fairly accurate. she's not really interested that much in ufos and has never seen one before. to her this is something that will never be known (what she saw). these were not aircraft carrying banners, we see them all the time and know exactly what they look like. she observed these for about 10 to 15 seconds. it was a very clear sky. she had her contact lenses in. the time it took for me to go outside and look in the sky was less than 30 seconds. she has no idea how big they were or how far they were, but she said they definetly didn't look like something you could start walking towards and soon find yourself standing under...Which leads me to believe

going west when i looked up the street noticing a bluish white light, at first i thought it was a planes nav lights because after a few seconds the light had changed to red, but the light was not blinking or moving it stayed red and seemed to be getting brighter and more vibrant at this time the object faded back to the bluish white light and began to move side to side for about 5 to 10 seconds not too much just enough to notice it wasn't stationary then it stopped and seemed to be hovering it had only been about 1 minute that i had been watching the object and at this time it change from the bluish white to red  and began to move up then down a few times it moved much more than the side to side motion and it didn't move fast it moved slow and steady. at this time i had reached the driveway to my house. before i went to get the camera i seen it changed into a yellowish orange cigar-shaped light or orb. before it change shape the bluish white light was a sphear or circle and the light seem to then turn a yellowish orange and stretch into the cigar shape. it was trippy!! at this point i ran to the camera by the time i made it back to the road the yellowish orange cigar shaped had turn back to the whitish blue orb and was still changing colors back from bluish white to red, the light did not seem to be blinking it seemed  as if the entire object was  fading in and out  from bluish white to red taking about 3 to 5 seconds to change from bluish white to red each time it changed. at this point it had been about two two and a half minutes total that i had watched the object. with camera in hand i started walking down the street to get closer to the object. as i was walking closer towards the object  it seem to be  either descending below the tree line or moving away  holding a steady red glow no longer changing from whitish blue to red. at this point i started to back away from the object to try and keep it in my view  but as i kept backing up keeping it my view it kept moving away (west) or getting lower. i had watched the object for probably about 4 to 5 minutes total. unfortunately well i was trying to take pictures or film,nothing would show up due to the streetlights interference on the camera  i did manage to take a video  but like i said with the street lights you could not see the orb  or any sign of it in the video. i don't know exactly how far away it was but the object most likely was a mile or so away and anywhere from 100 - 800 foot up i really couldn't say. i do know that it was very cloudy because it was about to rain and the light or orb was well below the cloud line. from the time i realized it was not an airplane a feeling of anxiousness excitement and curiosity had overwhelmed me and all i could keep thinking was please come closer so i could get a better view and a wonder of what it could be or who?!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

no birds or bugs churping, nothing! i couldn't make out how far the object was in the sky. my first thought was, i'll run inside & get my camera & take some pictures! then my second thought was, i'd better stay here & watch to see if it takes off suddenly!  you don't know how bad i struggled with this knowing no one would believe me unless i had some sort of proof! but at the time, it was more important for me to watch every moment of the object i was witnessing since it only happens maybe 1nce in a lifetime so i stayed! the whole event lasted about half way through my cigarette. i guess about 4 mins. in total. i couldn't believe what i was seeing! the hair literally raised up on the back of my neck & that's only happened 1 other time in my life! it literally made a straight-line pass over my house & passed over my aunt & uncles house through the treelines & slowly disappeared out of site! the surface of it looked \"mirror-like\" as if it were reflecting the faint clouds & blue sky around it. dark in color. no lights, no sound, no kind of emmissions whatsoever!  it never changed shape 1 bit on it's surface. you would think it would change shape as it went over the mountaintop. just looked like a dime sized ball shaped object. kind of pewter black in color. it was incredible! i went from feeling like i had just won the lottery to, oh wow, nobody is going to take me seriously if i tell them about this. so, it was a mixed bag of an encounter. i told a few of my relatives & after a few looks of,\"this guy is smoking something\" i just stopped talking. really a bummer to experience something so spectacular & then get ridiculed & labeled as being some sort of whacko for even mentioning ufo's. since then & even before then i have looked up in the sky at dark only & have seen lights going from one part of the sky to the other in less than a second fast like someone shining a very bright light in the sky only no beams being emitted from the ground to very slow glowing objects going in straight lines like a plane does only it looks like a star in the sky moving very slowly. i never really took the whole ufo thing seriously, even after seeing the lights zipping around like stars from one end to the other. my dad said they were satalites. i told him, i don't think satalites move that fast. since my siting i always make sure i look up like i always do to watch the stars. after watching a show about ufo's i searched sightings of ufo's on june 22, 2012 & all of these links with the same exact date popped up from surrounding states around me! that's when i decided to file this report. just in case you guys have heard of any sightings on this particular date around my area or surrounding states.  thanks for reading. sincerely, ford smith","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":69914,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.2844786,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08292015-0031","longitude":-82.0919823,"occurred":1340397600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1440891279000,"summary":"Looked over my left shoulder & there it was.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":28,"maxtempi":82,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":73,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":18,"mintempi":64,"minvism":0,"minvisi":0,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":28,"maxtempi":82,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":73,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":18,"mintempi":64,"minvism":0,"minvisi":0,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"24614","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1163,"locationName":"Grundy, Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:9959"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Plymouth","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Four objects following each other red/ orange no noise as they approached each one after the other appeared to dim. we thought they were moving straight up and away from us whereas each one slowly dimmed out until they were gone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":69913,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.7705045,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08292015-0030","longitude":-71.719515,"occurred":1440884700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Hampshire","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1440886948000,"summary":"Four red/orange objects following each other then each one dimmed out or flew straight up out of  sight","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Plymouth, New Hampshire","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:9960"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Monessen","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Out in back deck.
