over dc from brookland ne by dctv metro station, also white unmarked oblong craft during day over ft totten ne/nw sta. first obj over bklnd seem red large bright obj.Over bnai temple steeple from bklnd sta is west directly toward 14&oak nw intersection west of bklnd me 9&michigan/newton st ne, brooks mansion houses dctv sta next to brookland metro rail train sta along side csx amtrack hot rails. during months, i get off train btwn 10-1030 through 1130-1230a sometimes after 1230-130a last bus on friday nights only. during 2-3hr noticed a lot of ninghts, several large bright objects since stars planets too small over brightly lit station area in dc hard to see regular stars planets with naked eye, so after my camera captured images of obj in sky, noticed obj was moving very quickly zigzagging constantly hovering within viewfinder box of camera app, while taking multiple f 1/8 high speed 8-15-25 imaged per second - minute. \r\nin apt may began noticing a second larger obj directly across opposite direction of initial red emitting obj, over pkg lot across metro and bus sta beyond dctv metro ph lot dye east of first obj.\r\nsecond obj is larger, emits blue blue-green glow. in june while ibserving taking 600-700 photos so far, of objects hovering, shspeshifting, rotating, morphing...\r\nwhile taking pictures of lg obj blue#1 with a smaller obj nearby lower to right, suddenly a high super warp speed obj oblong flies by out of nowhere materializes near blue#1 and flies across b#1 very fast disappears again about 1-2 hand lengths in sky my hand span is about 7in so no more than 7-14in in front if me but miles up in sky? \r\nimmediately after this sighting, a commercial airplane slowy passes across similar path, across sky blinking slowly, across from right to left about se to northeast across easterly b#1 , i could not take pictures in awe wondering if anyone on plane could see b#1 beyond it easterly direction ? \r\nit happened within 2-3seconds of each other.\r\ni tried taking pix of commercial airplane but nothing came up on ph camera images too far too dark and happened too fast only 2-3 seconds and my ph software was slow. i turned to red#1 and took more images. saw another flyby across r#1 obj un milliseconds too fast to capture. \r\ngota by may june 2red obj #1 & #4 and 2 blue obj #2 & bg#4 and 2 flybys at warp speeds across in front of hovering stationary morphing obj, often has tail light stream from main craft.\r\nin jun blue #2 showed itself to me via my ph camera lens, suddenly while taking 8-15/sec obj seemed to appear visible to my naked eye as if it used my ph camera lens to zoom in on itself, previously could not physically zoom in too blury to see any detail if craft or lights, only could capture light changing shapes from distant, appearing in pictures like blurred lights and changed shapes two lights, oblong cigar shaped triangular, spherical and square shapes with shadows, tails and other light coming from other sides of objs not visible from this view. \r\nobj took me perhaps telepathically close to it, and even with my poor eyesight i was only once able to see craft clearly as a dome sphere shaped ark metallic reflective surface like mirror material similar to surface of sony touch screw smart glass, multi color reflective, craft surface seem robotic computerized with intelligence and telepathic communication capabilities, with me showed itself so i can see it via ph camera lens almost as if changed my ph technology capabilities beyond f 1/8 20.7megapixels hd camera lens, i felt for a few seconds within milliseconds that i was out there near close enough to craft to see it up close.\r\nspace craft was spherical dome shaped with \"layers\" of shielded square doors on outter surface ay least four maybe five layers of squared surfaces all same dark metallic multi reflective smart glass type of material, very \"cloaking\" reflecting everything in outterspace in dark if space had window almost yet barely visible, i felt more like it was telepathic than physical vision and almost as if it brought me out to it with capability of phone camera lens\"zoomed\" me to see it and then i looked at ph screen image and i was back in earth nit in the phone image next to closer to craft. space craft seem very large pod like biosphere biodome, had \"tails\" of white light as it revolved and changed shapes in my poor images compared to the vision of it it just revealed itself to me, intelligent computer robot built in the outter surface material of craft able to communicate with me. \r\n\r\nafter june, i lost my phone jul2 before 1215 am on metro fm train to bklnd \r\ni saw few more sightings almost every other night weekly if i were out returning on metro to bklbd about same time.\r\n\r\nin july the blue #1 obj seem to have moved directly over above bus stop 90Â° overhead i had to lay in my wheelchair to see it directly over me. \r\nit looked like similar obj i saw previous months with anothe smaller obj nearby also doundlg same hovering maneuvers zigzagging back and forth at sharp angles like drones scanning the sky then it suddenly moved across sky very quickly from location toward bnai westerly east over bus stop and repositioned itself over brookland bus stop toward former positions easterly beyond bus stop pkg lot. \r\n\r\ni was amazed yet my new replacement device was not fast and i wasn't able to capture the motions. several homeless men saw o j i pointed out and catholic university college students asked and thought it were just a satellite, planet or star. one didn't speak english, hispanic? spoke spanish, asked if it were star or planet. i yoke him not it's neither. but none of the bus stop patrons were very interested in looking at it. other fem student or lady just found it interesting. \r\n\r\nbefore and after thunderstorms july there were .Ore police and helicopter activity. near station. metro transit police were parked directly in bus bay but i dared not ask them to look up, and they seem engrossed in their conversation work, monitoring radio and watching station entrance from across bus stop driveways. \r\n\r\nafter storm in westerly dir over brookland train sta a helicopter flew very close dir over tree tops across sta from southwest to northeast \r\nhelicopter activity had increased with increasing crime activity during warm spring and summer months. so right after i saw red #1 being passed by warp speed flyby obj ascending in westerly side also going from sw to north direction in sky. i was suspect of all police and helicopter passing close by over metro.\r\n\r\nobj #2 flyby was very far in atmosphere buy crossed over path position if red #1 usu dir over bnai temple steeple.\r\n\r\njune to july cresent moon phase i came downhill on bus from bus stop of taylor and hardwood ne intersection, saw my second flyby over too of trees and electric,lines, however too much light from electric poles, moon, trees and,lines covered sight for good pictures. i took a few with sony xperia yet not very good. craft was not commercial or known military aircraft, very far up directly over taylor sy ne brookland heights hill by catholic university dufor athletic field at bottom of hill. it flew in se dir iver street light electic wires overhead. \r\n\r\nagain battery died or low too slow to catch high speed shot. \r\n\r\nseeing blue #2 and 3 obj every week in end of jul throughout aug 2015 now, finaly got old sony ph back from person who found it on metro, very suspect staged incident as guy claims name is prince never turned it in to metro lost and found nor police at union station amtrak stayin bldg where he works at fast food restaurant.  \r\n\r\ni am very suspect of people who keep my found electronic devices without returning to station. i wonder if thus has been happening in past with all my phones and electronic devices being lost stolen on trains buses. i have recovered 2 -3 devices when i know exactly when and where i dropped then as being last person on bus or train before it goes out of device and back into yard or maintenance station where employees cleaning out station trains and buses usually find my lost devices immediately after i drop them within 30min. \r\n\r\nthese are only pix of moon, as my images are in sony and uploaded to google plus account and drive @dancingqueendc son are un twitter uploads but mostly i have emailed cropped shots to wilbur allen @ufodc expert who has confirmed my sightings images and plans to set up cameras to film possible portal or wormhole in sky space above brookland ne dc. he is at logan circle area nw sw of my location, may be explains objs flying from sw dir toward brookland ne of logan. \r\n\r\ni look forward to any investigators coming to check out this area esp she ufodc wilbur allen has set up cameras to film sky activity. \r\n\r\nsometimes when obj rotates morphs it looks like round in middle with extensions arms or tails four to eight coming from center of obj, other times it look square triangular and like 2-3-4 bright round oblong obj and sometimes clouds form in shape of infinity mobile fig 8 over area of ibj becoming blurry cloudy and cloaking it, then it disappears in sky and reappears within second/ miliseconds of same second. i usu observe it til it disappears and looking around moon and both sides\r\n\r\nbetter images are from sony xperia z1s 20.7 megapixel hd camera f 1/8 \r\non my google plus drive you can see i shared images with @ufodc wilbur allen on

visit me and as she left her home about a tenth of a mile from mine, she noticed an red orangish orb object flying in a straight path above the colorado river.  (we both live by the river front). by the time she drove to my house and i went out doors to greet her, our attention was drawn to a second object in the sky, same color, no sound, flying just above the casino's.  we assumed the last one observed was following the direction of the first one.  we observed the last one together and argued it was drones or something known since it had no sound and they were following one another but then the last one did something i don't believe a drone could do.  the second orb after it passed by all the casino's slowly as though looking for something, suddenly began an ascent into the night sky at a very rapid speed and a few blinks later it was beyond sight, vanished.  i have witnessed, as your records will reflect, many ufo's in my lifetime but i have never seen anything like this.  i searched for other sightings around or near my site and it appears that people in phoenix were inundated with sightings on the same night.  they did not describe these objects though. just one last note; all the animals in the neighborhood were acting neurotic, the feral animals i feed outdoors failed to show up for their nightly food, which is highly irregular, domestics were howling, my cats trying to hide and then after these things came and went, every animal was fine.  my girlfriend was electrified with electric static for a few days afterwards, everything she touched gave her a shock but i didn't have the same thing.  i just got spooked living alone and couldn't sleep well for a few nights.  neither of us had our cell phones with us and did not take pictures.  sorry.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":69902,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.1462146,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08292015-0019","longitude":-114.5714841,"occurred":1440276300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1440865833000,"summary":"Two wittnesses at ten minutes apart saw one of two red orangish oval shaped ovjects fly over the colorado river from the south then ascend into the sky at high speeds and vanish.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":41,"maxtempi":105,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":34,"meantempi":94,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":29,"mintempi":84,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":41,"maxtempi":105,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":34,"meantempi":94,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":29,"mintempi":84,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"86429","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"Bullhead City, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:10109"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In summer of 1968, i was visiting my aunt and uncle with my family. my sister and i stayed in their trailer. during the night i woke up and looked out the trailer window and saw two oval dark objects hovering in vertical positions next to each other above the tree tops. i became extremely terrified. my sister and her baby, on the bottom bunk, did not wake up even though i strongly shook her. i left the trailer and locked it behind me thinking that would keep them safe. i ran past the animals that were in an enclosed area. they were racing around and frantic. the hair on my arms stood up. it was almost like static electricity was in the air and the air felt strange almost like time was slowed down, it's very hard to explain the feeling of the atmosphere and the terror i was feeling. i was somewhere by or past the animals when i heard telepathically \"don't be afraid, we're not going to hurt you.\" i was still scared and then proceeded to the small guest house, where i thought my parents were staying. unknown to me they had left the guest house because of black widow spiders. i banged and yelled at the door but there was no answer and i think i opened it but they weren't there. i continued to look back and the objects were still there, then proceeded to the main house. i got my parents up and tried to tell them what i saw but at that precise time there was a car accident on the road in front of the house. everyone ran out to it. by the time i got anyone to look, the objects were gone. when i told them what i saw they all laughed. that devastated me. it's hard to explain how i felt afterwards. i was almost in a shock and walked around feeling numb. there was one other time when i felt that kind of shock and that was when my brother was killed in a freak accident. i tell you that to try and convey to you how this effected me. i never spoke to anyone else about this until i got married. years later i became interested in going to mufon meetings and became a field investigator for mufon. i'm searching for answers as to what i saw and experienced.

lights caught my attention out towards the east. i pointed them out to my wife and jokingly said look ufos to which she replied, those are helicopters.\r\n  they looked to me like two helicopters following an airplane but as i looked harder the two in the rear were following a light. that's what it looked like to me, like the interior light of an airplane shining thru the windshield of the forward plane (or whatever it was). i grew up close to a small airport so i've seen planes and helicopters at night and these didn't look quite right. the two units in the rear had the normal red green and white strobe on but they seem to blink from the same place and weren't uniform, the strobe would flash every second for a few seconds and then flash twice very quickly and maybe not flash for a couple seconds more, i can't be sure but i think the other two lights (red and green) flashed every once in a while also.\r\n these three (units) were also flying very close to each other, i would guestimate around 100 to 125 feet from each other. i'm not a pilot but i would think the faa has rules about flying so close.\r\n  the forward unit was just a light (what i saw looked like a light shining thru a windshield) the two behind had the same windshield light with blinking strobe lights, they made no sound and couldn't have been but a mile away flying about the speed of an airplane or helicopter ( i would guess 80-100 mph) and i'm guessing 1000-1500 feet up from the ground. because of the darkness i couldn't make out any shapes so it could have been three small planes flying in formation but they were way to close to each other and the lead plane didn't have running lights.\r\n  my wife went back into the rv and i sat down outside and kept looking around the skies and saw what i consider space junk (dull star like lights traveling in a south to north or west to east direction) and was ready to go in the rv and go to bed when from the nw came a light like a bright star which i thought was a commercial jetliner. i was waiting for the strobe to flash or to see the wing lights to confirm that it was a jet (there was a lot of airline traffic that night). i did see a flashing light but it was bluish green and it flashed out ahead of the craft in a cone shape and wasn't as bright as the airplanes i'd seen earlier that night. it turned in a large circle and headed to the ne. i told my wife that i had seen another ufo and she just said \"yeah right\" and told me to come in it was getting late. i've never witnessed a ufo but i think i saw four of them

of some of the pictures -- the silver colored chevy volt.  \r\n\r\n2.)  while it looked like the moon was shining through some clouds -- it was overcast that evening --, the shape of the lights caught my attention:  it looked disc shaped and it didn't appear to be moving or changing shape which is what you'd expect it to do if it was the moon shinning through clouds -- as the clouds move, the moonlight shining through them should change shape too... but the shape of these lights didn't change for as long as i was observing them, which was for approximately 5 minutes.   \r\n\r\n3.)  my first thought about what i was seeing was that it was the moon shinning through some clouds, and so i fired up the star-chart app on my smartphone and sure enough the app indicated that that's approximately where the moon was.  but the next night (or it could have been a couple of nights after), as i was leaving work at the same time it was a clear night and i noticed that the moon was nowhere near where i had seen the strange series of lights -- it was approximately 20 degrees up higher in the sky.  in fact, upon paying closer examination to the pictures i took, you can see where the moon really was:  the moon's directly above the storage building, it's in the top 1/3 of the picture and it looks like a bright dot of light (my car is in the lower left), and you can see that the disc-shaped anomaly is much lower in the sky, and from where i took the picture it appears directly above the rh side of the storage building.  \r\n\r\n4.)  from where i was standing at the entrance to rfa engineering, looking south.  the disc-shaped light anomaly didn't appear to be moving, or changing shape.  i also thought it could be spotlights but as you can see, there's no spotlights shinning up at the disc-shaped anomaly.  after observing it in the rfa parking lot, i wanted to try to get some pictures of it where there was less light pollution, and so i drove over to the nearby wells fargo and snapped a picture from the parking lot there -- the disc-shaped anomaly still had the same shape as before and didn't appear to be moving.  because my smartphone star chart app told me that that's where the moon was -- and as i already mentioned, the app was wrong (because i hadn't calibrated my phone's compass before using the app) --, i just dismissed what i was seeing as a curious play of moonlight and really slow moving clouds.  but why would the moon only illuminate this one particular bank of clouds and not anything else, especially considering that the moon was so much higher up in the sky.  \r\n\r\n5.  i was intrigued, and if i hadn't dismissed it as the moon poking through the clouds i probably would have paid much closer attention to the disc-shaped anomaly, including trying to take better pictures of it, and i would have watched it for a much longer period of time.  \r\n\r\n6.)  after dismissing it as the moon poking through some clouds -- which it turns out that it couldn't have been --, i left for home.

francisco's ocean beach.  at about the point where ulloa street meets its west end, we spotted a glowing orange orb, about the size of a basketball (or slightly larger), hovering about 30 feet from the ground on the west side of the road, to our left.  as there were no other vehicles on the great highway as far as we could see, in either direction, i told my friend to slow down as we got closer and then stop.  he opened the sunroof so i could stand up and get a better look at the object.  as there were still no other cars, i told him to turn off the motor for a moment so i could listen for any sounds coming from the orb.  the object was silent.  then, it appeared as if the object was dropping a second orb that was transparent, but of identical size and color, from itself.  however, as soon as this begins to happen, the second orb fades and vanishes before it finishes dropping completely from the first.  at that point, and before lowering myself completely back into the vehicle, i told my friend to just start the car and drive.  after i was back in my seat, i watched the orb remain where we found it, but now there was a second orb that seemed to be sitting stationary in a nearby position, maybe 50 feet apart from the first one.\r\n\r\nwe drove on to the cliff house so we could talk about this over coffee.  before going in, we looked back south over ocean beach and the great highway, and observed approximately 5-7 orange dots of light along the same area we observed the first orb.  we went into the cliff house and found a table by a window that overlooked ocean beach and the great highway, and we observed the orange dots of light disappear, one-by-one.  then something else started to happen.  it looked like bonfires were appearing and disappearing and then reappearing in different places, within seconds of each other, down on ocean beach.  after a couple of cups of coffee, i asked my friend to drive back down near the beach so we could get a closer look at these bonfires.  we parked and walked up to the breakwater wall.  directly in front of us, on the sand, about 40 feet away, stood approximately eight half-naked silent people wearing black pants, all surrounding a fire inside of a black garbage can.  we'd seen enough and my friend took me home.","distance":"21-100

however is his account, and the photographs he took are his photos, taken with his phone. in his words:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nit was the night of june 12, 2015, early morning of june 13th. between midnight and 2 am, approximately 1 am or so. i was outside just relaxing, and suddenly i looked up and saw this strange object. i just happened to look up and see it.\r\n\r\nimmediately i could tell it wasn't normal. if i had to describe it, as crazy as this will sound, i would say it looked like some sort of robotic space craft. \r\n\r\nit was a dark green metallic looking, hexagonal shaped cylinder. this cylinder was rotating, and had what i can only call plasma-looking light sources burning out of several apertures on the tail end. these were white in color, with some reddish orange as well. it did not look like fire or like lights. it looked like some sort of \"energy\" which is why i say plasma. that's the closest thing to it my mind can come up with.\r\n\r\nat the opposite end (what i call the \"head\") was a black cone shaped, pointed head. like a space capsule or a rounded triangle of some kind. this portion was not rotating like the hexagonal cylinder was, and had no lights of any kind.\r\n\r\nthe object's surface looked somehow very old and worn to me, but was clearly metallic. despite how old and beat up it looked, it was clearly technologically advanced. it wasn't some drone or an ordinary air craft. i got a clear look at it, and it definitely wasn't normal.\r\n\r\nbased on my estimated distance from it, and other measurement factors, myself and a friend estimated its size as somewhere between 30 and 70 feet in length (depending upon distance,) and no more than 144 feet away.\r\n\r\nit moved across the trees at that approximate distance, then stopped and hovered. as it hovered, it seemed to descend very slightly. the rear portion never stopped rotating. i looked down at my phone to get a picture, which i succeeded in doing. when i looked back up, it was vanishing out of view due to distance and obstruction. i did not see it again after this.\r\n\r\nthere were no unusual sensations or feelings, other than being very weirded out by it.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\ni, his friend, reporting this on his behalf, saved and renamed the images. but they are otherwise unaltered to my

sitting stationary in the sky is a huge band of uneven lights with illumination between the lights. i say to her what the \"ef\" if that, she says i have no idea. i get out to try and take a picture of the huge thing. it will not show up in the display of my android phone even though we both clearly see it with our eyes. a car pulls up behind my car that i left sitting in the road. i completely ignored it because i wanted whoever was in it to get out and look. it was a cop. i move my car which would have put his dash cam directly in line with the very large thing in the sky. i don't know if his equipment would capture since we could not see it in my display. he asks what were doing and i point to the sky and ask him if that looks weird and he says \"yes it kinda does\" i say does it look like a ufo he says \"either that or something that belongs to our government\". my friend said that he said in his 35 years on night shift he has never saw anything like it. he watches for a while and leaves. as we continue to watch the thing takes off. we follow the direction it went which was north on highway 27. we easily find it about a mile up the street. it was not hard to find because it was bright, huge and once again stationary. we pull into the wal-mart parking lot and continue to watch for about an hour. during this time the thing appears to tilt because a brightly lit dome that looked semi-transparent comes into view on the top of it. it also has these leg like sharp points on the bottom that also have lights on them. the bottom of it was sort of shaped like the bottom of the batman symbol. it also has a row of bright lights that appear to be on a solid band around the thing and they look like they are rotating around it. so i say to my friend at some point i saw something fly out of that thing and she said so did i, a few minutes ago. i am still trying to take pictures and it just is not happening. i think i got a picture of the thing that came out of it. because it is definitely not the big thing. i imagine that wal-mart and the murphy gas station would both have security cameras that might have captured the thing if it would even show up. while we were there watching it moved again to a position more to the north. it was as if it was in one spot then the next because i don't recall watching it motivate to the different location. i am going to include all of the pictures i took even though the very huge thing did not show up because even if it did not show up its there. we could see it with our eyes. the thing i would most like to impress upon someone is the size of this thing. it was freaking humongous. i have no idea how to judge size and distance when something is in the sky so i would not even try. i can say that i have never seen anything close to this size in the sky before. it was most definitely not anything that i had ever seen before either on tv or in the sky. if the government built this thing they really are hiding technology because it was positively sci-fi looking.  \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then
