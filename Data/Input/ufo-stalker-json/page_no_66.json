side forming a disc shape. i stopped and observed it moving to the east toward me, i decided to call my daughter to see if she could see from her location east of me a few miles (she couldn't) i then observed the object stop and hover in place then start moving south. i attempted to take video but was unable to open video mode only a time lapse photo was taken (will need to review). my dog was getting agitated and whining then the disc went from being large and visible to accelerating to the southwest at such a rate of speed it went to a pinpoint and gone. i'm retired air force and that was not an aircraft from this earth, i have never seen anything like it in my life before, truly amazing. my dog seems to be bit lethargic after getting home and i have a very bad headache, not sure what to make of that as of yet.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

heavily during the day and there were many enormous clouds in the sky above. in the southwest direction there was a very small and fuzzy greyish cloud, very far from any other clouds, and much smaller than the rest. i looked at it initially because i thought it looked funny. after a few seconds, it flashed a white light. i kept looking at it, trying to find the source, waiting for it to flash again. i couldn't see any airplanes or anything like that around, just the cloud, and it was moving southward very slowly. someone told me, and i have seen it myself a couple of times, that there is a small airplane that takes pictures of the ground, apparently government owned, but i couldn't see it this time. sometimes airplanes fly nearby as well, but i couldn't see or hear any, either. so i immediately thought it was an ufo, for some reason. the way it was slowly moving made me think that it was something unknown, even though it might as well just be a regular cloud moving because of the wind. and then the light, which i honestly can't understand and would like to. i felt sure that it was an ufo (even though i've never believed those could be seen from earth) and also a bit curious and afraid. i kept looking at it for a while, but could see nothing more, only that it was still moving very slowly southward and that it appeared to have smaller clouds under it, also soaring and moving. as it was getting darker, i went inside, but for some reason the \"incident\" was still on my mind, so i decided to look the internet about it.

green cylinder turned into a 3 dimensional triangle where they both oscillated together for only about 10 seconds before they returned to their original position and carried on stobing again. \r\nas it was so cold outside me and my brother went in for a hot drink before returning and noticed the lights had moved about a mile away and were strobing again. \r\nby this time it was around 11:50pm and as i watched them strobing one shot diagonally from its strobing position about 300miles to the top right corner and the other cylinder carried on strobing then  that joined the hovering green

on a pod cast. in late 1992 or early 1993 i came home from college around noon. i went inside picked up my sister then remembered i needed something from my car. i put my sister on the car hood got my bag then looked above my house and saw a white glowing egg shaped object flying by. it looked like it was giving off light, i thought to myself that it looked like a white glow stick (at this time there were only green glow sticks so it stuck in my mind). it flew over the house at a slow speed i would guess 30mph in a south to north direction. it was higher than the power lines by about 50ft. i thought \"what the heck was that!\", i looked around to see if anyone was outside because it was mid day. there was no one out. before it got out of site it stopped and returned hovered descended to the height of a power pole above my house. it hovered for probably less than a minute, turned hovered then a helicopter appeared from the south above it. the helicopter felt like it just appeared but after noting it i noticed it was not as loud as i have heard others to be. it was black. the object turned from having the small end toward me pointed west to pointing north again. then it flew north came back and hovered next to the helicopter. the objects size was the same as the helicopter side by side not including the blades. the sliding door on the helicopter opened and i could see one person inside. while this was happening i started to yell for my father and anyone inside the house to come outside. while looking at this display i thought to myself that whomever came up with the ship in the movie \"the navigator\" really got the color wrong but got the shape of the ship almost right, then i thought that the one in the movie changed shape before it took off. as i thought that, the object changed shape becoming more triangular and speed off north. the helicopter began to follow it and two other helicopters where a few seconds behind the original one then 4 others, black also. at this time my older sister finally came outside i told her what i saw. i don't think she believed me but then a formation of about 8 black helicopters flew over heading in the same direction. my thought about that is where the heck do they keep these helicopters and how could i be the only person who saw this thing. anaheim is a busy city and i lived very close to disneyland. i just thought if anyone else saw this thing my siting could support them.","distance":"101-500
