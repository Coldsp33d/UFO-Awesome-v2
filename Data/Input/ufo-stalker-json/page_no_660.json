needed to rest and take a break. my brothers went inside the house to get a drink i had asked them to bring me something to drink. i had laid back on my elbows on the ground, resting. within a few minutes i heard a deep low pulsating hum. but i couldn't tell exactly where it was originating from. it started to get louder within 15 to 20 seconds. the sound was above me, coming from my left, i saw a silver gray disc shaped craft moving very slowly just skimming the tree tops by about 15 to 20 feet. it traveled in straight path over the clearing of my yard, which was approx. 150 feet, and then over the trees again. as it was traveling over the clearing of my yard it was almost directly over-head as i noticed 4 dome shaped lights flashing bright intermittently. the dome shaped lights were approx. 6 to 8 feet in diameter. all white in color. no other colors were visible. after the craft had cleared the span of the yard, my two brothers and my mother came running out from the house. my mother frantically asked me what that hum and vibration was and i told her what i had just witnessed. she was in shock. the vibration rattled the windows and knick knacks inside the house. later that evening we heard on the radio that others had seen it in the same area. the thing that impressed me the most was how it could stay airborne to be moving so slow! to this day it still seems so surreal. i can still see the entire event in my mind as if it happened today. extremely vivid!!!! i remembered being disappointed that my brothers didn't see it. but they certainly heard it and felt it vibrate. i also remember feeling scared and anxious after it was over, not while i witnessed it happening. although i wad young at the, i did realize that what i was seeing wasn't a normal thing to experience. it just wasn't normal looking. the very existence of this craft.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

expecting the delta aquarrids meteor shower if i recall correctly. there were three of my friends outside in the grass field of the apartments. around 11:15, the three girls left to a friend's place somewhere not far from the apartment area. apparently, the meteor shower began. i stayed there to look at the meteor shower. around 11:30 pm, i was still looking at the meteor shower since the girls were still at a friend's house. i was enjoying the view with awe due to my interest in astronomy. eventually, i turned to my right, and something from the sky appeared. at first, i thought that it was an aircraft or balloons perhaps. as it came closer, i noticed that it wasn't any of those. eventually, this object was moving at a steady speed of about a foot per second, about 15 feet over the apartment's swimming pool. this object appeared to change into different figure continually. it did not have a fixed shape. it appeared to have an appearance of a cloud almost. it was about 20 feet from me. at first, i thought i was just seeing things, but my sister was also looking out the window. she was getting scared and said:\"al? what is that?\". immediately i ducked down hoping that this unknown object would not see me. this object was hovering/floating over the swimming pool for about 10 seconds. then, it began to change course to the northwest. it emitted no light. i could not tell its actual color due to the yellow lights of the swimming pool area. it emitted no sound whatsoever. there was no wind at all during this time of that night. as it floated away, it appeared to emit some light. when the girls came back, the object was completely gone. i could not sleep for most of that night. at morning, i told some of my friends of what i saw. i did not considered it, or classified it, as a ufo as most people think it means. but i did identify it as an unidentified object. i told my mom about it. but she said it could have been the devil. i told my next door neighbor, james, and told him what i saw. his opinion was that i could have been a military drone that he have been hearing about in the news. i told him that it was illogical because it did not have a familiar aircraft shape or design and that there was no sound coming from it. for days after the event i did not get enough sleep because of staying up to see if the object would ever come back. it never did. later, i found out that there was a us air force recruiting area exactly where the unknown object flew. regardless of what i knew, i kept the matter confidential to myself and destroyed anything i wrote about it. it was until about late december of 2013 that i told an elder in my congregation (or church). and it was in july 2015 that i recorded an account of the matter","distance":"20 Feet or

year), during the day (probably between 10am and 2pm) as it was only a day camp.\r\nwhere: at pena adobe historical site, abutting interstate 80, north of fairfield, and just before vacaville on pena adobe road,on the east side of the highway..\r\n\r\nthese accounts have been delved from my memory and subconscious years following the events.\r\nmy search for understanding started when i began to self analyze why i had had recurring nightmares, for years after that summer, of a large, bleach white, cow's thigh bone chasing me. a bizarre, and somewhat ridiculous thing to be scared of. even after the dreams stopped i had a persistent fear of the image in my mind. i was never scared of an actual cow's thighbone though. i discovered that the large white thigh bone was actually an alien, humanoid in shape, white, and somewhere about my size.\r\n\r\nthroughout the weeks i was at camp i had a number of instances of missing time leaden with fear.\r\n\r\nthe most detailed experience is of the counselors taking a large group of us kids on a walk; then waking up on the ground (with a gap in my memory of how i'd gotten there). everyone on the hike awoke on the ground in a clearing. i have an image of numerous aliens some taller and brilliantly white, and other shorter ones, in some way interacting with people. i recall someone noticing something weird with their watch. i'm not sure what. there seemed to be a transition between the time when people who were awake and were alright with the aliens' presence and when people started to return to 'normal' awareness and be bothered by what had happened and was going on. eventually we all continued with our normal camp activities, but a number of kids were sent home early (or the entire camp?) due to a sudden illness that was going around. i know many people were out of sorts and upset the rest of that day.\r\n\r\ni also have images of being amongst the trees there and a small alien there - and i have a terrible fear of being taken.\r\n\r\nanother time i remember an image of a large glowing thing hovering over part of the camp. it is luminous, possibly ovoid, primarily glowing white with multiple other colors mixed in. i remember feeling something from it, as if it made a sound,but it didn't.","distance":"20 Feet or
