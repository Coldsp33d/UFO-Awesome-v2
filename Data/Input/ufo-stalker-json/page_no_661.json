i was in my front yard climbing an apple tree. the yard has no other trees so the view is clear. across the street from our house is a golf course. hillview country club. directly across from our house was the club garage where lawn mowers and equipment are stored (since 1973 this structure has been removed). while in the tree a structure to the right of the garage building was a craft with an elongated shape. the craft was just shy of the length of the garage and hovered about 30 feet off the ground perfectly still, perfectly silent. there were orange lights (or close to orange) sequentially flashing around the craft shape. while the 5 of us observed it for about 30 seconds (seemed like minutes) we shouted ufo!. the craft, in a split second was hovering above the apple tree about 20 feet above the tree (still no sound and perfectly still). all 5 of us screamed and jumped from the tree. the craft shot of to the left as fast as a bullet (meaning not a visible path with the naked eye, but more like disappearing.) at the time this was all happening in the 1 minute of time, our parents were just around the corner of the house under a carport drinking beer and socializing. we (the 5 of us) ran to our parents screaming. when our parents asked what was wrong we told the we just saw a ufo. they said \"go play\" of course not believing a bit of it. from what i have heard in the days folowing is that this same type of craft was seen the same night over the drive-in movie theater movie screen. the drive-in was named starlite drive-in and is now a supermarket parking lot, but star-lite car wash still resides there. over the past 20 years or so i have been trying to find a report or news article about the drive-in sighting but have not come up with anything. after this day there were strange sightings at our house (1973 162 no. street). visible human looking things for a lack of a better term. they had no face but looked more like a mannequin. this is what i believed to be a ghost at that age, but now being an adult, i feel both are connected somehow. one thing that was interesting about the location of this sighting is that the house to the right (on map) had a large radio antenna that was about 100 feet in the air, and several houses down the street had the same antenna. when i think back on this moment in my life; i feel that what ever or whoever this craft was, may have seen these antennas and were just seeing what type of structures were in the area. just a though that has stuck with me.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":69801,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.59380994278412,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08262015-0020","longitude":-71.0917907485601,"occurred":111603600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1440598120000,"summary":"Elongated shape 35' wide hollow center with lights surrounding shape and flasking in sequence","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":89,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":26,"meantempi":78,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":20,"mintempi":68,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":89,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":26,"meantempi":78,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":20,"mintempi":68,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"01864","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":15381,"locationName":"North Reading, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:10625"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Blanchard","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On january 19th, 2015 , i was riding with my dadand discussing chemtrails with him. i had sent the congressman an email about another subject and my dad sugested i should send him some pictures of the chemtrails. we stopped at the dollar general store in downtown blanchard la. when we went out to get in the truck i thought and took 3 different pictures in different directions of the chemtrails. when i got into the truck, i was showing my dad the pictures and realized i had photographed a bright white light in the first pic toward the sun. when we backed out, we both looked in that direction and no lights could be seen with the naked eyes. so i ask him to stop at the red light so i could get out and take another picture.  i did. i got out of the truck and pointed the camera in the direction of the sun and took the 4th photo. the light is in it also. still cannot be seen with the eyes. it has to be in the infared light range which means it has to be advanced technology and it did seem to be sitting stationary. when i zoom in on the object in the picture it looks perfectly round and the same color as the invisible light on a remote control. i don't know if our government has the ability to make flying objects that are only visible in the infared light range yet. but this object had those characteristic s.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":69800,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.5782142,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08262015-0019","longitude":-93.88933720000001,"occurred":1421661240000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1440597274000,"summary":"The object was invisible to the eye.

meteor shower as we both loved stargazing and i personally loved just spending hours looking at stars, satelites, etc. we went to the field as there was limited light so we could see the night better. the night sky was very clear as it was a new moon also and no cloud coverage, we thought it was perfect to go up and check out the meteors. we got to the field about 10:20 pm, 10 minutes before the iss (international space station) was due to fly past so we made sure we made it up to see that. the night was a great success with many meteors spotted and also the iss. i decide i would sit up a little and make myself a cigareete so i wasnt actully looking at the sky at this time and was looking down. about one minute later my friend who was still looking at the sky suddenly got up and grabbed me and called my name to look up, ''what the hell is that?'' he said as i looked up and thought i would probably just see a plane or a big satelite, but no as i looked directly above us where thre huge reddish white lights at first in perfect line formation, it ascended right above us the lights looked to be the lights of maybe one big craft above us, i cannot expalain how big it was in comparision to distance but it had come down a bit now and the lights where bigger as it came down. shocked, i then watched as it went at great speed heading northwest to a main road, the lights where beciming more faint at this point but also the shape went from a line to almost a v shaped craft but all the way through the sighting the actual craft was not visisble and was almost like a plasma looking material in the way of the object only showing the lights themselves, the sighting lasted maybe 30-40 seconds and had i had collected my thoughts quick enough i would have attempted to get a photo or video with my phone but i was too much in shock, i literally couldnt breathe nor speak for about 5 minutes, i have no idea what it was but the 3 things that stood out for me where 1. the size\r\n2. the fact there was no sound whatsover and with a craft so big and low you would have expected some noise.\r\n3. the speed of the craft as it took off from stand still was unnatural to any aircraft at all. \r\nmy friend didnt really believe in ufos until the night we saw this and still we cannot explain at all what it was.","distance":"101-500

bright flash of light coming from the flashing light at the 2 o'clock position at the same time i say 2 lights come out from the flash one went left the other went right toward the flashing light at the 10 o'clock hour. then there was a second bright flash from same spot and one more light shot across the sky t the left then it happened again there were a total of 4 lights streaking across the sky that night. shortly after the the 4th light the blinking light at the 2 o'clock hour stopped blinking.\r\n\r\nlast february 2015 was out looking for lights in the sky at about 8:30pm. i saw a few

just vanished light went out.\r\n\r\nlast may 2015 was driving home about 10pm near my house i saw another red pulsating light up in the clouds just hovering when i got within 1/4 mile from this

silouette of the bugs in the sky. from the west a blue/white light was moving slowly accross the sky and watched it for around a minute, meanwhile my friend was getting bugs and i was trying to figure out what it was, not a plane, helicopter, as no noise and no flashing lights, what else is in the sky in the early 90's? satelite? yeah most likely, then it stopped directly above. satelites dont stop. at this point i started to question everything thats happening,wierded me out, within a second or two of it stopping it almost fell down from the sky and it was really bright. i felt like it knew i was watching it. i am not exactly sure of how high and far from me but it was really far, so far i thought it was a satelite, then in an instant it wasn't anymore and the light got very bright,

1947 crash site had been reported, near the town of corona nm. \r\nwe arrived in roswell at approx 6pm on the 6th august 2015. after checking into our hotel myself, my wife and my two children 12 and 10 years old left to drive towards corona at approx 7:30-8pm\r\nthe sat nav told me that corona was about one and half hours away, which meant we were going to get there when it was dark. we were only there for one night so it was a now or never trip as we were traveling across the usa on holiday from the uk. i'm a big ufo enthusiast and author.\r\nas we travelled up the 285 the sat nav turned us down a smaller road, the 247 towards corona. it was very dark by this time and it was a perfectly clear night, all the stars were out. i drove down the road for about 20mins not passing any other vehicles at all, it was at this point that i saw the object for the first time. \r\na bright orange ball (sphere) of light in the air approx 1-2 miles away 200-300 foot off the ground from what i could make out, it was to my left side straight out of the front wind shield of the car. there were no other lights on, the car illumination was turned right down and there were no other cars on the road. \r\nthere was one bright orange ball of light, i noticed it straight away because it stood out so much against the black night sky. now bare in mind this first sighting lasted about 20 seconds the ball split into two and separated to approximately 1inch apart in my view, then completely disappeared, like they had turned their light off. \r\ni asked my wife who was talking to the kids at the time if she had seen that! she replied she hadn't. i slowly started to pull the car over to a stop when i saw a graveled area to the side of the road. at this point my 10 year old daughter was screaming her head off as i was trying to get out of the car to take a closer look. she was uncontrollable, shouting for me to stay in the car and not to get out. i turned back around to look out of the front window whilst trying to get my phone out so it was ready for videoing anything, then it happened again. \r\nthe bright orange ball in the sky reappeared in the same area as before, to my left about 1-2 miles away and 200-300 foot off the ground. i said to my wife \"there look it's there\"\r\nwhen she turned to see what i was talking about it had split into 2 then 3 bright orange balls, all the same size, they were really bright. they started to rotate around each other then the ball (sphere) closest to the ground shot off to the side like a shooting star on an slight angle towards the ground, as this happened the other 2 balls went out just like before, this sighting took approximately 30 seconds to take place, so unfortunately i didn't get chance to get anything videoed on my phone. we waited for awhile but they didn't come back. we continued to drive to corona after waiting for about 15mins. it took quite some time for my daughter to calm down after this. \r\ni told dennis balthaser about what we had seen the next day, as we were booked on his tour of roswell. he said that fit in with other things that had been seen.\r\nit was amazing, i just wish i

particular early morning i couldnt sleep. i was on my phone actually looking up ufo sightings when i decided to go outside and do some star gazing so i did. as i just layed down on our driveway at my home here in this small town of munford, tn, i caught what i thought at first was a star actually was moving across the sky at a steady, straight pace until it disappeared out of sight. as i keep looking up, my heart pounding with excitement i see another light that actually pulsated as it moved across the sky. i saw at least 7 or 8 of these starlike lights moving across the sky. two of them left at the same time and after those two left i noticed an airplane headed from the navy base in millington, not far from munford where i live. after the plane came things started to die down. i am not one to seek attention and i have no reason to make this up. i have had what i feel is a deep spiritual connection to these ufo's. i have good reason to believe that these ufo's are actually reaching out to me in some kind of spiritual, psychic way i cannot explain in words. they have appeared to me throughout my life but as of recent they have truly made themselves known to me in mind blowing proportions. please, if anything, i'd love to talk to someone about this because it is much more bigger then single sightings. i have good reason to believe that these ufo's are reaching out to certain people's for a reason. i understand i must sound like a skitzo paranoid crazy. i've been called crazy all my life for speaking openly about these things and the last thing i want to do is contact you guys just for a joke.. i feel like i can truly help the ufo community and i would love to know if there are others who have seen things in the skies on multiple occasions throughout their lives as i have. some of the ufo's i have seen i can much better describe in person.\r\nthanks and with

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When: during the school year, many times throughout the year(s)\r\nwhere: falls elementary school in green valley, suisun/fairfield, ca\r\n(falls elementary i believe is now closed, but it was near the intersection of green valley and rockville roads.)\r\n\r\ni pieced memories of these events together after many years. i was approximately 7 years old at the time of the occurrences. while attending falls elementary school not only myself but many of the other children were affected by these events.\r\n\r\nthere was a walnut tree grove on the back side of the school. there was no division between the school grounds and the grove. in essence the grove, which was never tended, was on school grounds. beyond the grove was a stream marking the border of the school.\r\n\r\ni used to enjoy playing with the kids around and in the grove, but one day i realized i had great fear of it and never played there again. when in 5th or 6th grade, i believe, i had a vision/dream of kids being kidnapped and taken over the stream to a craft on the other side of it. i don't know if this was a vision of something that was going to happen, was happening, or had happened sometime in the past. but it terrified me. it bothered me enough to try and face my fear and try to make myself venture near the stream so that i could try to figure out what had instigated such a strong vision. i could never quite conquer the fear, nor was i ever able to get an exact explanation as to what had actually happened.\r\n\r\ni clearly remember another time, when in 2nd grade, i was playing outback of the classroom (the side with the grove of trees) on the sidewalk, sitting down, and a small alien, humanoid figure (classic big head, big eyes, small stature - a grey?) was in front of me. my recollection is that i didn't perceive him as he truly looked at first, but rather as some friendly person/child. i think i played with this entity numerous times on different days on this side of the school, and this may have been the last time i did. while playing some part of me realized that no one else seemed to see him/it. mentally i then went through a rationalization process, initially thinking he might be an invisible friend and eventually admitting to myself what he/it really looked like (i don't think i knew what an alien was then) - though i still couldn't explain why no one else could see him/it. \r\n\r\nhe/it was talking with me in my head. i don't know if i was speaking verbally or mentally back to it. he aaas trying to teach me. math i believe. i do know that at the end of the exchange it wanted me to come with it. and when it tried to get me to go with it i told it no. it did something with it's mind trying to make me go, but i refused. and i am extremely strong willed. i was nervous at this point. i got the impression that many kids were being taken (some walking and other not) through/into the grove. i got up, put my shoes back on (i'd taken them off while playing) and went back into the classroom, effectively trying to move myself away from what was going on.\r\n\r\nas mentioned above i believe the abduction of kids from my school happened many times; and over many years, not just that year, but from when i was a kindergartener (1973?) through at least 4th grade (1977?).\r\n\r\nadditionally i have a fairly firm feeling/recollection that at some point one of the kids was found injured amongst the trees of the grove. what had happened to him/her (or was that multiple kids at multiple times?) was never made clear. i'm believing it was a series of incidences more strongly now as the school right after made the trees off limits to play. i know that this did not stop the visitations though.","distance":"20 Feet or

out jogging at night and saw a strange formation of lights pass over, consisting of five objects that appeared like they could be jets - some continuous dim running lights that were orange or red, with blinking white lights on some of them - yet what was odd about this was that they were strangely close to each other and traveling in a straight line path, one behind the other, evenly spaced as if they were tethered. if they were jets, they must have been about a quarter of a mile behind each other, or less. something about this seemed abnormal. it does not seem safe or typical for military craft to maneuver in that kind of formation at night, and seemingly no commercial craft would be allowed to fly that way by the faa. heard low sound of a distant jet engine as the formation passed behind the tree line in the direction of bandera. the distance between them was a little less than the size of an index finger when held out at arm's length. at first i thought it was a jet, but then realized there were several in a row and they seemed to be tethered together in two pairs, consisting of an orange and a more red light, and some of them had a blinking white light (not sure if the rhythm of the white light was typical faa compliant); then i realized they were all evenly spaced; later the fifth one became visible. thought i noticed the last one moving unevenly forward or bobbing but that could just be eye movement against the dark sky background. they moved straight across the sky to the southwest as a group, at about the typical speed of jets. often i see jets at night but never in a pack like this and certainly not flying in a line. due to the formation and its evenness there was an odd feeling about this event, such that i thought i would report it to mufon in case it correlates with other individuals' sightings. maybe some other observers to the southwest of austin can track this flight further and determine if there is something more to it.","distance":"Over One

corner of my eye i saw approximately 5 red orbs through the tree tops heading southwest. i was looking straight down the street and the tree line is right there because my neighborhood is a horseshoe. at the time i had my cell phone, but i didn't even bother to take a picture because i know it took really crappy pictures. i remember just standing there in utter amazement, i was just speechless. i don't know if this was just pure coincidence, but i remember thinking at the time, \"it would really cool to see a ufo\" and low and behold a few mins later, i see not one, but around 5. i would like to think that somehow they could telepathically tell i wanted to see a ufo and they figured, \"hey, let's go say hi to that guy on the ground\" but that is probably unlikely. but getting back to the main story, i remember that they were red orbs, like flares, but they weren't pulsating or loosing altitude like a flare does, and i didn't hear or see any military aircraft in the area. they just flew in a straight, horizontal path that i could see through the tops of the trees. they just continued to fly southwest (left from my point of view) until i could no longer see them through the thick of the trees. i remember seeing two other people at the time of the incident, one person looking for something in their car, and another person walking their dog, but he were walking towards me so i highly doubt he saw it, and obviously the person in their car probably didn't see it either. i came back to the house and told my father, but he said that i was probably tired and was seeing things, and i've told it to many others and they've all said the same thing, but i remember vividly seeing them, their light shining through the tops of the trees, and of course as i have previously stated, they were completely silent. i would like to get your guy's opinion on the incident and send an email back to me. it may not be the most spectacular ufo sighting ever, but this was something i've been meaning to do for so long but have never gotten around to it. i am a big fan of what you guys do and i hope that someday we'll find conclusive evidence of alien life.

Africa","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This encounter, which occurred in december 1998, was witnessed by my late father who resided in cape town, south africa and who passed away in 2012. he was a serious and succesful businessman, management position, a man of honour, old-school...His word and his handshake were as good as any signed contract.\r\n \r\ni received a long-distance call in germany from my dad on the eve of the encounter. he was rather excited and in disbelief over what he had seen and began telling me of the chain of events...\r\n \r\nhe closed the store in simonstown after a long day and walked to his car. on the drive home, he decided to change the usual coast road route and to rather take the less-used mountain road home...\"ou kaapse weg\" which is afrikaans/dutch for \"old cape way\". my dad used to cycle that mountain road on the weekends, so he knew it well. as he drove towards the top of the mountain road with a view over the entire false bay area, he was confronted by a silver disc-shaped craft, dome on top, with an array of lights which seemed to rotate and which was hovering silently above the road directly in front of him. \r\nhe stopped and observed the craft for a moment before getting out of the car. the craft remained stationary and silent at a very close distance. he began walking towards it until he was only meters away, when he stopped his approach and continued to observe it. he told me that at no time did he feel threatened or in danger, but was just overcome with amazement. what followed is what makes this encounter so incredible...The craft darted off in a straight path over the bay, only to abruptly stop and remain stationary for a few seconds before darting in a straight path to another position, remaining there for a few seconds and then returning to it´s original position directly in front of my father, where it remained hovering stationary and silent. the craft then proceeded to repeat the triangular flight manoeuvres, stopping after each manoeuvre directly in front of my father. he told me that he had the feeling that the craft was trying to show him what it was capable of and was in a way communicating with him. after the third consecutive manoeuvre, the craft darted off over the bay and disappeared without returning again. this entire encounter lasted a few minutes.\r\nmy father then walked back to his car and drove home. he told my mother, when he got in the door, what had happened and shortly thereafter on that evening, he called me in germany. my dad never told anybody else about this encounter...But the following day my mom anonymously called the local cape newspaper and asked if anyone had seen anything over cape town on the previous evening. the reply was...Yes, as a matter of fact people did call in saying that there had been strange lights observed on the that evening.\r\n \r\nthis encounter changed my father´s outlook and he began collecting books and videos on ufos and began doing his own research on the subject.\r\nwhen i visted my parents in cape town the following year in october of 1999, my dad showed me what he had gathered on information on ufos and also showed me pictures in the books he had found of craft that looked identical to the craft he had seen the previous year. since my father´s passing, i have picked up where he left off and continue researching the ufo phenomenon...","distance":"21-100

a sentry noticed something strange in the sky while scanning with his thermal imager. the sentry called myself and my partner over to look and confirm what he was seeing. he described what appeared to be a star moving in the sky high above base. to the naked eye, nothing appeared out of the ordinary. to me this ruled out a satellite because they can be seen without any kind of equipment. the moment i looked through the thermal imager i could make out what did indeed appear to be a star or satellite, however, it was moving all around the sky. not fast, but slow. just a solid, white light. i looked again with my own eyes and could not spot it, but with the thermal imager it was very prominent. i watched it for several seconds when to my amazement, it split into two objects. but that wasn't it, soon one of them split again! one object had turned into four objects in a couple minutes time. i had no possible idea what they could be as they were obviously not falling stars or anything of that nature. the four objects moved all around the sky above us, not fast but slow. they were high up and appeared as small, white spots of light. not being able to see them with the naked eye, but to see them so prominently with the thermal imager, told us they were giving off a great amount of heat. while we were watching the objects i caught movement low on the horizon. i looked down and saw two more flying low across the flight line, moving west to east. they appeared large, and with the thermal imager they were giving off an intense amount of heat. they went out of sight so my partner and i jumped in the vehicle and headed towards the flight line to see if we could get a better look. we got into a better position, got out and started scanning. before long, we noticed one of the spots of light moving back our way. coming from the east right towards us. i was watching with one eye in the thermal imager and my other eye open to the sky. as the object moved closer, it got brighter and brighter in the thermal imager. it had to be giving off an incredible amount of heat. as i followed it, it came into the glow of the lights from base. my partner and i could not believe our eyes. it was within about 100 yards, moving smoothly and silently from east to west. it was a large, pyramid shaped craft. the base was towards the ground with the point straight up to the sky. right off i figured it was roughly two stories high. each side was maybe 25-30 feet across. it did not spin, it moved perfectly level, not quite over the top of us. it had no features of any kind. i could not make out doors, windows, or lights. i could not see any seams or rivets of any kind. it was completely smooth and featureless. i could not tell what color it was, but the lights from base glow orange and the craft appeared a dull brown, leading me to believe the craft may have been gray in color, or possibly somewhat reflective. what amazed me most was it was absolutely silent. being as close as it was, we should have heard any kind of engine noise. there wasn't even a rush of air as it moved. it was so smooth and impossibly quiet. we felt no vibrations or anything else as it went by. it made no sudden maneuvers of any kind. it moved off to the west in a straight line and disappeared. we continued to watch objects high in the sky until midnight, 2400. just as suddenly as they appeared, they disappeared. we watched the rest of the night and saw nothing. we did not lose track of any time. i kept track as we watched. my partner and i were bewildered. i had seen a ufo once when i was younger. it had been quick and shocking, and i had always wished to see one again. i was so excited and yet quite puzzled as to what i saw. my partner was pretty shaken up. the next night, while i was on post, i was watching the sky intently when i noticed an airplane high above base. judging from the positioning of the blinking lights, it was rather large. it circled high above base for quite some time before moving off and disappearing. even for an air force base, this did not appear normal to me. for several nights after, we kept our eyes open to the sky but never saw anything else. i had kept a detailed log with descriptions and drawings, but unfortunately it was lost when minot flooded in 2011. i constantly replay the event in my mind and can see the ufo plain as day. i will never forget it.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

on my porch to smoke a cigarette. while i was lighting it i could hear the engine of a small plane passing somewhere overhead. when i finished lighting it i looked up (where i was standing i was facing south on the second story porch of a two story building) to find the plane right there in front of me was a giant black triangle flying west to east. i live two houses from the corner. the object was flying over the next block no more than five houses from the corner opposite of mine. i'm not that good at judging heights but i would say it was no more than eight stories of the ground. it stayed on a constant straight path east at a constant speed of what i would say was about 20 miles per hour. it was rounded at the edges and i believe i saw what i can only describe as a bee hive pattern. i couldn't make out whether it had any lights or not. i saw none shining off of it at the time. it wobbled slightly left and right the whole time i saw it. it made no sound whatsoever. and it had no visible windows or openings. while i was watching it i called for my girlfriend to come outside and see it but she didn't have her glasses and couldn't make it out in the sky. i noticed my neighbors daughter paying in the back of or apartment building witch is ensure that lived in a back house so i screamed for her to get her dad but he wasn't in his house he was in the apartment below me and didn't make it out in time. they're were a lot of people outside at the time but it seemed like people, in my opinion, were determined not to notice it. the most intriguing thing about the whole experience is the small plane that originally made me notice the object. it followed the object from the time that i noticed it until it war out of site. at first it flew behind it at about a distance of 5 to 10 yards. then it moved to the side of it, then a little above and to the left of it. when i first saw it i thought the object was a balloon that the plane was trying to keep in the air until it moved to the side of it asks it still didn't explain how it kept it at that particular height the whole time. i didn't have a chance to take any photos are record any video but i saw two photos online that i'm going to attach. one is a sketch that shows the overall shadow off the object. the other is digital photo that shows the design i think i saw. everyone i tell this story to thinks i made it up or that i'm going crazy. i didn't and i'm not. this was one of the strangest unexplained moments of my life. i saw a bright strange light going up and down the 10 freeway on my way to arizona in 97. at first we thought it was a helicopter but once we pulled over and got out to get a better look you could see that it was no helicopter it was a strange bright making no noise at all. we got in the car and left in a hurry. and there eye a lot of people that got out of their cars too to get a better look. but this object was in plane site being magnificent. i want to know what it is i saw do if you know of any other sightings reported at the same time could you please provide me with some information so i can have some type of closure. lol. especially if the pullout a mentioned reported anything. i could see take pilot good enough to see his head movements but not his or her features but i believe it was a guy. by the way, i live by the burbank airport and neither the plane nor the object landed there while i watched them. thank you...","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

queensferry by car, to hangout. we parked the car and got out for a walk down by the river under the forth rail bridge, at the time before the sealife centre was built you could walk right round under the bridge and around the cove.  there was a picnic spot on the hill to the left of the bridge looking towards south queensferry.  we were just chatting, getting to know each other , at the time we were looking out towards edinburgh to the left of us, i was watching planes coming into land at the airport, not really paying them to much mind as we were chatting away to each other. i thought what i was watching was a plane (the planes landing lights).  \"south queensferry has a big hill which blocks the view partially of edinburgh and the airport\". so the orb desended fairly slowly and was still in view in front of the hill instead of behind the hill which most planes that land at edinburgh airport do!  this caught my attention straight away and pointed this light out the girl i was with, we were quite stunned at this.  the light was pretty much in the middle of the river forth travelling west up the river past rosyth royal dockyard.  to our surprise the light/orb slowly desended to a level which would take its flight path under the forth rail bridge and forth road bridge and took off at an amazing speed, wow, we were takin aback abit to say the least.  i've spoken about this sighting plenty of times but everyone thinks i'm nuts!   my feelings on this matter makes me feel that who ever was piloting this craft did that manouver for fun, because it looked fun to my eyes.  it still thrills me now seeing what i seen, yours sincerely mark butler.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

viewing the moon and saturn. the evening of august 21st my girlfriend took several great pictures of the moon by placing her cell phone above the eye piece. on the 22nd i was going to take some pictures with my cell phone. the sky was clear no sightings of any air craft had occured that evening. while viewing the moon i attempted to steady my phone over the eye piece but the moon image would fade in and out so i asked my father inlaw to help steady my cell phone while i focused to take the picture. it took about 10 seconds to get my phone perfectly centered where the moon was very clear showing perfectly on my cell phone. just as i was to touch the screen to take a picture a winged type object entered the view finder from the two oclock position then passed in front of the moon and exited the view finder at the 8 oclock position. my father inlaw and myself looked at each other and said\" what the hell was that\" we both looked into the sky and seen nothing and heard nothing. we both showed each other goose bumps on both of our arms. we questioned each other again did you see what i seen. my father in law said yes, go inside and draw a picture of what you seen and i'll do the same. our pictures were very similar. i seen the ufo the instant it enetered and left the view finder. my father in law seen the ufo at the center of the view finder to the point it exited the view finder. the ufo seemed large, the image was crystal clear but yet we couldnt see anything with our naked eyes. fyi. we were'nt drinking or doing drugs. \r\n\r\n* i seen three orange lights. one on the
