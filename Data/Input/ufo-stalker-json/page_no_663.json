and why would they?\r\n\r\nadditionally i have a memory of a classic saucer shaped craft in a different field, next to the house on the other side of us from the one mentioned before. there were multiple lights on it that were colored but mostly whitish. again there was my brother and multiple neighboring kids there along with me.\r\n\r\nanother occurrence was when i was playing during the day in my bedroom. i was playing with my toy kitchen and drawing. i had this entity with me communicating with me empathically. there were no formal words, just a sense of intention. eventually i wanted to draw a picture of the entity and it indicated that i was doing the eyes wrong and had me look at it to get the eyes correct. i then become very upset because the eyes are not normal human shaped but large, dark, slanted, almond shaped eyes. the entity didn't want me to become upset. it then left by climbing out the window. i realize after it left that the window is closed so i become even more upset. this occurrence happened during the summer or spring because i remember it being sunny and warm outside, it was the middle of the day, but i didn't have my window open. that's why my noticing that the window was actually closed sticks out.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":69735,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.2674122,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08242015-0012","longitude":-122.1129622,"occurred":110332800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1440424062000,"summary":"Multiple experiences in local when less then 5 years old, my brother, neighbor, other kids and i abducted.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":31,"maxtempi":88,"maxvism":32,"maxvisi":20,"meantempm":21,"meantempi":70,"meanvism":27,"meanvisi":16,"mintempm":11,"mintempi":52,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":31,"maxtempi":88,"maxvism":32,"maxvisi":20,"meantempm":21,"meantempi":70,"meanvism":27,"meanvisi":16,"mintempm":11,"mintempi":52,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":15394,"locationName":"Fairfield, California","triangle":false,"type":"Alien Encounter","$$hashKey":"object:10979"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"New York","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My girlfriend and i after walking a friend to the train station desided to \r\nbuy pizza and walk home together on 115st lexington ave. manhattan.\r\nwhile walking i seem to notice this object in the sky that seemed very strange and unlike \r\na plane or helicopter. i pointed it out to her and we both were puzzled as to what it was so we continued to observe it and it's flight pattern. as it moved accross us in passed over and seem to disappear.. when we looked toward were we first saw it another one appeared!! we were amazed at its shape and look.

close together before also shooting up behind a cloud until icould no longer see anything. i know it wasn't birds and i originally thought they looked like ww1 planes. there was no noise no lights just black and definitely a flying object. i was mesmerized by this experience. just can't explain it. i did not think to take a photo with my camera i just could not take my eyes off what i saw until

interstate 40 when i noticed three bright lights that were moving just under the low cloud cover. it had rained lightly half an hour before this time so the clouds were low. i then realized the three lights were glowing spots on the underside of a craft that i was seeing. the craft passed silently over me, then proceeded west gaining speed over the mountains. i managed to get my phone out any take a picture before driving around the mountain to where the flight path would be visible. by the time i traveled around to see approximately a minute later the craft was no longer visible due to clouds.\r\n\r\nduring the flyover i noticed the white to golden, flickering, pulsating lights in a v shape on the bottom surface of the black to charcoal, circular craft. the surface texture was hard to observe as the ship was gaining altitude into slight cloud cover. when it was visible the texture seemed metallic, black, rough but not reflective. there was an effect of the bottom surface of the craft that made the clarity rough or fuzzy looking. no noises were heard, a lack of noise is more accurate as the craft moved. the rate of acceleration was quick, once it cleared the mountain top and partially in the cloud cover. this was not a jet, or helicopter, it was some sort of craft that is solid. the clouds didn't shroud it like a normal jet passes through the clouds. the craft looked more distorted as it got closer to the altitude of the clouds as if it were mimicking the visual effect of cloud cover.\r\n\r\nmy initial reaction was amazement to the lights then a sudden surge of wonder to what it could be. i grabbed my phone and took pictures while speeding up to proceed around the bend of the mountains. in  the minute it took me to travel around the mountain, the craft had disappeared into the clouds.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path with

front of the house.  the most light we had outside that night was the construction lights for the highway a couple of blocks away to the south, giving the horizon a yellowish glow, so we just avoided looking in that direction. we live in a house backed by empty and unused fields, so i was excited to have no lights to mess with our vision as well.  around 11:30 p.M., i observed what i had originally thought to be a shooting star moving west to east. as it got closer to me, i realized several things that stuck with me: it never changed speed, it never changed altitude, it didn't put off any light (like a \"falling star\" would), and it was absolutely silent.  i followed it from horizon to horizon until i couldn't see it anymore, and while it didn't put off any light, it appeared to be a dark gray or brownish color.  it was a \"v\" shape, and it was blocking the light from the stars as it passed over me.  \r\n\r\nsorry for reporting this so late, but i am honestly not sure what i

2012. a group of 7 of us decided to go for a walk the night before the wedding around 1:30am. we walked down trails that led us out to the main road where we originally turned to enter the campground. we all stopped to talk and look up at the stars considering we don't have the pleasure of observing the night sky without city lights. it was a clear night and the moon lit up the sky. we could see the tree line for miles following the road to the south east of us. \r\n\r\na few minutes after looking up, we noticed a bright red orb shaped light high in the sky. at first we thought it was a planet until a second bright red orb shape separated from it. one red orb stayed in the same spot as the second one slowly moved to the west maintaining the same horizontal position as the first orb. we all asked each other if we all were seeing the same thing, making sure our eyes weren't playing tricks on us. \r\n\r\nthe second orb that moved toward the west then dropped hundreds of feet in a split second and continued moving west in a straight line. then shot up about half the distance it originally fell from and quickly moved to the east in a precise straight line.\r\n\r\nthe first orb held its position as the other one maneuvered around. after a couple minutes the first orb that held its position began to move as well in the same manner. then they came together one above the other, there was a significant amount of space between them, and stayed in that position for a brief moment. the red orb that was on the bottom slowly started to descend, this time at about a 40 degree angle as if it was coming in for landing. we watched until the red orb fell slowly into the tree line and was out of our site. the other red orb then shot up into the sky and disappeared. \r\n\r\ni would say we were about a mile or two from where the red orb went below the tree line.\r\n\r\nall of us were so scared after we couldn't see it beyond the tree line. we walked really fast back to the campground. we still tell our story to people and still have no explanation. we are hoping someone else might have seen the same thing we did, but could see where that second red orb went after we lost sight of it when it went passed the tree line.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

starting on thur july 23,2015 with two other people both males for a total of five of us. on fri the 24th it was very hot 98-100 f we had planed a hike in a near by canyon(10-15mil away by dirt road( utv/moto-bike travel ) but do to the heat only 3 of us decided to go on the hike.\r\n\r\nmy daughter and i drove in our utv and the friend, road his off road moto bike, we lead he followed all the way there about a 1/4 mil. behind us do to road dust,\r\n\r\nwe hiked till 3pm and headed back to camp, 3-4 miles into heading back the friend passed us and went ahead, \r\nas we were moving along at around 20-25 mph my daughter said stop dad stop stop, i stop in just a few seconds as she said.. what is that what is that! i leaned back in my set looking over her back looking up at the ridge top and at first i didn't see anything but then as i leaned back further and looked forward.. there it was,\r\n \r\nit was a  crescent shaped craft hovering just above the ridge,it was translucent white and curved down to a sharp point on both ends, it hovered for about 10 seconds then started to descend down behind the ridge, as it did it started to glow very brightly in a orangish earth tone color, there were pine trees spaced out right on the ridge top  and it was at lest 6-8 trees wide (guessing 150-200 feet wide)\r\nit went down behind the ridge out of sight..As we sat there looking to see if it would come back up my daughter said it was moving along the ridge top slowly in the same direction we were traveling and when we stopped... it stopped its forward motion and just hovered, that is at the point i saw it,(when it was just hovering) we stayed there for 10-15 min and didn't see it come back up so we moved on, \r\nas we went up the road we saw our friend on his moto bike waiting on the side of road for us to catch up, he said what took so long? and we told him what happened, later he did confirmed he did sit there for 10-15 min waiting for us.\r\n\r\n back at camp my daughter was very upset and did not talk much for over the next 4hr. the area this happened in dose not get many riders/visitors, we did not see any one else that whole day going to the hike or on our way back. the canyon we were in has high canyon wall on both sides of the road, this is an area i know very well and don't need maps to get around\r\n\r\nshortly after we got back to camp one of the other men there split us up and had us draw what we saw, the pictures we drew that day are in this report.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
