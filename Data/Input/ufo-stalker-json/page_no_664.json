faced the direction of west on the road, i noticed two bright lights in the distance. at first i dismissed them as airplane lights because we have a municipal airport that always has planes fly at night. but as i kept observing the lights, i noticed they didn't have a blinking light like airplanes or helicopters do and the lights were flame-like so i finally came to the conclusion that they were none of those and something not of this earth. i showed my mom the lights and she agreed they were a peculiar sight and not normal. we were amazed by the lights but we also felt a little nervous because of how abnormal the sight of the lights were. the lights did not move at all. the light on the right was slightly higher than the one on the left. they flickered like candle lights in the distance which gave the lights it's flame-like qualities. they were pretty far from where we were driving. they looked as if they were in front of the frito-lay factory in the desert by the maricopa-casa grande highway. then all of a sudden the lights disappeared or disintegrated. they were gone for less than a minute and then reappeared with the left orb or light higher than the one on the right this time. they were in sight for a few more minutes and then disappeared again. a minute passed and they reappeared with the right light higher than the one on the left again. they stayed for a few minutes longer and then disappeared again. after about another minute only one reappeared and this one was really bright. by this time my mother and i were about to arrive home. i took two pictures of the one light at this time. i didn't take any pictures of it before because i knew my picture quality was bad and my camera could not zoom so i thought it was no use until i realized i needed some form of evidence of the lights if i was going to report it. now it looked as if the light was still in the desert by the highway but more closer behind the old copper mines than the factories. then finally the second light reappeared after a few minutes but this one was farther away from the brighter left light and more closer to the ground. it was a lot more dimmed than the left light. as i got home i was amazed by the lights so i tried to find binoculars to get a better look but unfortunately the ones we had were broken. so i ran back outside to look at the lights again but the very bright left light was gone and the dimmed light was the only one left. it was still close to the ground but i could barely see it now. after a few more minutes it was finally gone and i never saw them again. this all happened within a time frame of an hour. my mother and i were completely baffled and amazed by the lights the whole time. as i went back inside, i told my cousin about it and he said he had saw lights like that just the other day but he didn't want to say anything about it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":69703,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.883722199999994,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08232015-0023","longitude":-111.7496321,"occurred":1439937000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1440345950000,"summary":"2

convertible.  i was driving north on randal rd., in aurora, illinois,upon coming to indian trail rd i made a right turn & headed east.  after driving about 0.35mi i noticed to objects, that seemed to be coming out above the tree line to my right(50 ft) and in front, on the south side of indian trail, on a path sse to nnw. i immediately slowed down, also at the same time looking out for traffic behind me. within seconds i noticed the colors they were eliciting from underneath the objects; 4 bright colors, red, white, orange like i think blue, but not sure; i thought to myself who in the hell would be flying drones at this time of the evening; as they approached me overhead, i was mesmerized by the vibrant lights, and then after they went hovered past me (crossed the street), and were behind my left shoulder, i realized that they were emitting no sound, thats when i realized that they were not \"helicopter drones\" and actually could be \"something else\".  i immediately knew i had to try and get a picture of it, so i quickly made a left turn, to almost the wrong way into golden oaks pkwy., i pulled over, to get my phone camera ready, looked to my left, looking west but did not see anything, due to the row of houses.  i then quickly made a u-turn, went back to indian trail rd., made a right turn & headed west very slowly going past the houses, but did not see the 2 objects,i had lost sight of them.  i continued driving west and went into the walgreens on the northeast corner of randal rd & indian trail rd.  i parked just a few yards from the pharmacy pick up window, the northeast corner of the walgreens lot.  i got out, looking straight east, & scanning that horizon, within a minute or so i saw two white lights, orbs like, with no colors, ascending out of the sse, behind the water tower, that was about 100 ft away and then held a path going nnw to n or so. i saw a total of 7-9 of these objects, solo(see video), in twos, & one of three objects at the same time, it was like a parade, and they kept coming from the same location.\r\nfor some reason after the 2nd clip, my phone camera froze, would not respond, so i had to do a forced restart.  by the time i

standing in a line looking at these lights cris-crossing each other,for some reason i decided to walk towards the lights,i remember my cousin and his aunt yelling at me to come back,i was about 100 feet away from them,these lights look like dirt bike lights,cris-crossing each other,i notice fog around me, the lights were really bright getting closer that's wen i realized that i couldn't here the engine noise from the dirt bikes coming at me,they were still yelling at me to come back,i got scared at that point so i turn around to go back to them???What i remember after that, is we were in a storm sewre all five of us,these storm sewers were above ground,before they put them in the ground,i guess it was a construction site not far from the chip stand,what i remember the most that morning is that i didn't know how i got there?And my cousin aunt was in a panic,i have no idea what happen that night,i never told any one for long time,it bothers me to this day ,","distance":"21-100

this time. around 9:50 pm we said goodbye to them and walked out the front of the house and down the driveway to see them off. after hugging goodbye, my wife looked up in the sky and asked, \"what is that?\" i quickly followed her gaze, and down the road about a mile, hovering above the tree line was a triangle of lights just sitting there, hovering. after a few moments it rotated as one unit slightly to the right, and then began to get larger, like it was coming toward us. off in the distance we could see a passenger plane in the sky with its light blinking, and it was on a trajectory that took it toward the ufo, though it was much further away and higher in the sky. the lights on this triangle were unblinking and orange/red. as it came closer to us and got larger, i began to see the outline of a triangle, with the three points lit up by these orange/red unblinking lights. i kept my eyes focused on in and since i did not have my cell phone with me, i was shouting for someone to take a picture or video of it. the hairs on my neck were standing up and i had goosebumps just looking at it, and a feeling of excitement/uncertainty/fright. ever since i was a kid i always wanted to see a ufo, and now that that's apparently what i was witnessing, it left me feeling many emotions. from behind me, i heard our female friend say that the lights weren't showing up on her camera phone. she was trying to take a video but the lights would not show up on her screen. so we stood there for about three minutes just watching this triangle as it appeared to come closer to us at an extremely slow rate of pace. it was positioned so that there were two lights on top, and one light on the bottom. the bottom light began to fade away, and with it the outline of the triangle. about 20 seconds after it faded, the top right light faded and more of the triangle disappeared. 20 seconds after that the top left light faded and it was gone. we stood there for a moment catching our breaths and looking at one another in stunned silence. my wife and i had to go pick up our daughter from work, so after a moment we said goodbye to our friends and asked them to let us know when they got home so we knew they were safe. my wife and i got in our jeep and went to pick up our daughter, and all the while i kept my eyes trained on the sky since i was in the passenger seat, but we did not see anything else for the remainder of the night.

years if that adds some credibility. i was off duty at the time. we were approaching an intersection in the town of soquel, ca. darkness had just set. we are a coastal community and this time of year the fog rolls in when the sun goes down. it wasn't foggy at ground level but the cloud cieling was very low; maybe a few thousand feet. we were facing toward the connecting town of capitola wich sits right on the monterey bay. we were no more than 1 1/2 miles from capitola and the beach waterline. no other vehicles were on the road at this time. we approached the intersection and stopped for a red light. it was at this time we observed 10 or so lights traveling from left to right very slowly just below the fog ceiling. they were all exactly the same size and color of light. about basketball size with a bright yellowish light hue. they were stagered in formation one high one low one high and so on. the light they emitted was consistent not blinking in any pattern. they all seemed to move slowly up and down not necessarily in unison. just kinda bobbling as they traveled slowly. we jumped out of the car immediately and fumbled to get a picture with my wifes phone to no avail. suddenly as the first light disappeared farthest to the right the rest of the lights also did one by one as soon as they would reach the same spot the first one disapeared at. maybe a few second or more apart. never saw anything like it until i was watching a ufo program on i think the history channel one day. the program showed the exact lights in the exact formation traveling left to right at dusk over some mountains in arizona. i woke my wife at the time and rewound the show for her to see. she absolutely agreed it was one in the same. there are no airports in the vicinity and no military bases besides no plane or helicopter would be allowed to fly in that weather. we rarely see them during the day in good weather. i tried to find other possible witnesses to no avail. i very certain what i saw. not fireworks","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was a sophomore in highschool, living in argenta, illinois.  one afternoon, i was riding as a passenger in a car driven by an adult family friend, to go have dinner with his parents in maroa, illinois.  we were travelling west on washington street road (macon county road 38) and had just passed the large (unique) 4-legged high voltage power pole where the north-south and northeast-southwest high voltage lines cross. (between leghorn road and brush college road).  we were travelling about 55 miles per hour.  the corn and soy crops had already been harvested from the surrounding fields, the road was long and straight, and the terrain was absolutely flat. the car was a little black gremlin of late '70s vintage.\r\n\r\nit was bright afternoon daylight, and hazy blue sky with only high cirrus clouds.  just above the horizon, to the left of the road my attention was drawn to what at first i thought was a glare on the windshield, but i moved left and right, and what i was looking at remained fixed in place.  my attention had been drawn to it because it was huge, and hard to miss, and looked so out of place in a clear illinois sky.  for a split second, i thought it was a low, strange cloud.  but then i realized it could not be a cloud, as it was so white that it appeared to be brightly luminous.  it appeared to be about a mile ahead, over a farmstead to the left of the road.  it looked like the entire farmstead was in the shade.  in the time i observed it over the farmhouse, we closed that distance to less than half a mile.  the closer we got, the clearer it became that the object was massive.  it looked like a nearly flat disk, tapered at the edges, and was larger across than the farmyard and accompanying grain silo and barn, which means it had to be over 300 feet wide, possibly larger.  the only way i can describe it's appearance is: it looked as if someone had taken a knife and cut a horizontal slit in the sky, with white light shining through from behind.  it was hovering level with the horizon, perfectly still, and i heard no sound from it. (but the car windows were open, and the radio was playing).  there were no discernible surface features on the object.  it did not pulsate, but was uniformly luminous white.  the outline of the object was very clear and crisp, well defined, and smooth.\r\n\r\nadrenaline began to kick in for me, as it began to sink in what i was seeing with my own eyes.  and then, as we were about half a mile from it, it shot east, directly over the car, momentarily casting a shadow over us.  i turned to look out the back window, but i could not sight the object.  it had not accelerated to speed.  one moment, it was perfectly still, and then it was moving east at an amazing, apparently uniform speed, keeping constant altitude, in a perfectly straight line along the left side of the road.  it covered the half mile distance in less than a second, and i lost sight of it after it passed more or less directly over us.\r\n\r\ni was excited and frightened.  i had not said a word to the driver while i was looking at it... i felt transfixed, and couldn't take my eyes off it.  when it flashed over the car, i turned around to spot it again, but could not.  then i looked at the driver, certain that he must have seen the same thing.  he had turned white as a sheet.  (he was an avid baptist, in whose world view, such things as ufos were not included.)  he could tell i was looking at him, and slowly turned his head, but as soon as he met my eyes, and could clearly see my agitation, he snapped his head back to look at the road, and wouldn't make eye contact with me.  i asked \"you saw that, didn't you?!\"  he was visibly shaking.  he said \"it was probably just a glare on the windshield.  i said \"that was no glare on the windshield!\"  after that, he refused to ever speak of what he saw.  but i could tell he was scared.  he was usually a very easygoing guy (in his 30's) and i'd never seen him look so disturbed.  \r\n\r\nas we came past the farmhouse where it had been hovering, i asked him to stop, but he ignored me, and actually accelerated.  a couple of minutes later, we arrived in maroa, illinois.  i told his elderly parents what we had seen... and even when they asked him about it, he just laughed it off, and refused to even describe what he saw.  i was in a state of jumpy agitation all night, and i sat by the window in their kitchen, looking at the sky until it was time for our meal.\r\n\r\nthe car and its electrical systems were not disturbed at all during the event, nor did either of us experience any peculiar physical effects... apart from being shaken up by what we had witnessed.\r\n\r\ni made a sketch some years later, but my description here is more than sufficient to understand the appearance of the object.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:35","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":69679,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.031604160781704,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08222015-0026","longitude":-88.91283663706561,"occurred":432000000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1440281100000,"summary":"Massive white luminous, featureless disc, broad daylight seen from car, hovered then flew east at impossible speed","tags":["disc","light"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":35,"maxtempi":95,"maxvism":24,"maxvisi":15,"meantempm":28,"meantempi":82,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":21,"mintempi":69,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":35,"maxtempi":95,"maxvism":24,"maxvisi":15,"meantempm":28,"meantempi":82,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":21,"mintempi":69,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"61756","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":11669,"locationName":"Maroa, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:11179"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Dearborn Heights","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving east and object was approaching from east.  object passed over and then turned around and began to head east almost as if following behind.  i first noticed the object because the sky was clear and there was a good size orange orb moving towards us.  at first i thought it was a plane, but the planes have white lights and this objects lights never changed in appearance even after it turned around.  the object seem to trail behind my vehicle as i continued east and then appeared to travel south when i turned a corner and headed south.  by the time i got to my house, i could no longer see the object even after i got out of the car.  it just disappeared.
