moving slowly toward the direction of nyc. i watched them for about a minute or two and asked my wife to get my binoculars. i looked at them with the binoculars but lost site of them as my 2 year old son was jumping on me!!! i did manage to get really bad photos with my iphone due to the distance but you can vaguely see one orb in the corner of the photo. this was at 6.42pm. after i lost site of them i kept looking around to see if i could find them again. i did happen to notice a balloon floating south ( i watched it float away) about a minute i noticed another orb like thing moving south also, was shining silver. i looked at this through the binoculars also, this was more of an orange glow to it and it looked like it may have also been a balloon as it looked like it had a rope/twine tied to it. it was hard to tell what it was and again i was putting it down to a balloon on till it stopped!!! with that i kept looking through the binoculars and it was still hard to tell if it was a balloon. i watched it for about a minute as it was stationary but then it diapered and i lost sight of it as i ran in to get my camera. at about 7.19 i noticed another star like orb right above me. i saw it in the binoculars and snapped a few photos with my nikon d3000 and my 70-300mm lens. i took a good 70-80 photos in total. the odd part was when i first saw it through the binoculars and the camera it was view-able and i could take photos but then out of nowhere it was not visible any more, but the strange part was that i could see it with my eyes but not in the camera or binoculars. i kept snapping photos anyway as i could visibly see it and then another one popped up out of no where. again i could not see them with anything other than my eyes. before i forget back when i first saw the first orb with the binoculars i did see a cylinder shape craft fly by in view. i also did manage to see two of these orbs at once. i kept snapping photos and have got plenty of photos of the objects. the main object looks like a disk and reminds me of the video from the spacestation when the tether snapped!!!! the second craft that i got in the photos also for some reason when i zoom in it always comes up as a cross! the last sighting i saw the object was at 7.34pm and it flashed nearly like a light on and off three times and i haven't seen it since. anyway please find attached a few photos and feel free to contact me for other photos i took. i'm going to go back outside now and see if i can see anything else.\r\n\r\np.S photos are hard to see and better when zoomed in. please contact me for all photos.\r\n\r\nthanks","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with

gusta avistar el cielo porque he tenido varios avistamientos ovni desde hace unos diez años, entonces miro el cielo continuamente. no sabía que existía mufon y por eso tardé en reportar este avistamiento, pues muchas veces he querido reportar varios avistamientos que he tenido y creo que los avistamientos que he tenido pueden ser aportes importantes a quienes estudien el tema. ocurrió aproximadamente a las 9 de la noche, del 16 de septiembre de 2012, en medellín, colombia, barrio guayabal, parte sur de la ciudad. subí a la terraza de la casa de mi madre en tercer piso y observé en el cielo, parte suroccidental, algo que parecía un globo pero suspendido en el aire, con luz naranjada pero se contraía y dilataba, lo cual me pareció anormal. fui por mis binóculos semi potentes y cuando el objeto se veía más grande y brillante, lo avisté con el binóculo y vi perfectamente una nave espacial tradicional en forma de disco con domo arriba y abajo, en la mitad se veía una línea con 4 luces que la atravesaban y esta línea era blanca o con la luz más clara que el resto de abajo y de arriba, el cual era naranjado. se contraía y se dilataba. su tamaño era como el de un globo sin los binóculos, pero con los binóculos era un poco más grande que una aspirina. llamé a mi hermana para verificar que lo que yo veía era cierto. cuando ella lo avistó me confirmó que parecía una nave. mientras yo enfocaba mejor el objeto porque se desvanecía por momentos, me dijo mi hermana que qué eran esas lucecitas que aparecían en el cielo a la izquierda del objeto pero muy lejos de él. entonces miré las luces que ella me decía sin el binóculo y lo que vimos fue como una estrella roja como un foco también estática, pero de ella salían unas lucecitas blancas como una fuente de agua pero en vez de agua, salían lucecitas blancas como estrellas, todas alineadas y en capas, cuando dejaron de salir, iban hacia abajo alineadas, volvieron a subir en capas alineadas y volvieron a bajar, hasta perderse entre los techos de las casas. estas lucecitas duraron menos de dos minutos saliendo. inmediatamente dejaron de salir luces, esta estrella roja empezó a moverse lentamente hacia la derecha, en dirección hacia el primer objeto que estábamos avistando. cuando se acercaba al primer objeto, esta estrella roja se desvaneció, como si el primer objeto la hubiera absorbido. así se mantuvo el primer objeto al menos por una hora, dilatándose y desvaneciéndose en forma estática aunque a veces parecía moverse muy lentamente, hasta que desapareció. las dos quedamos impresionadas y mi hermana, que era completamente incrédula del fenómeno ovni, a partir de ese día le tocó creer en estos fenómenos. no sentimos miedo porque no era muy tarde y estábamos las dos mirando el fenómeno y las cosas se fueron dando secuencialmente. me pareció una de las cosas más sorprendentes y hermosas que he visto en mi vida.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s), Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

i think. we had a pair of binoculars. she noticed a bright light over the horizon in the north. our attention quickly changed to that area where we watched the bright white light which was a little larger than what we would have expected a helicopter nearby and low in the sky to have looked like. but it made no sound and did not move like any craft i have ever seen. at one point, another large bright red non-blinking light appeared next to the white light. it was at least as large as the white light and they apppeared to touch each other. the red light disappeared. the white light stayed between two clumps of trees for 10 to 15 minutes moving forward a bit then stopping and starting. it was moving very slowly if at all then it moved more significantly as though it was going to disappear behind the trees. suddenly it reversed direction and looked like it was going to leave the area going in the opposite direction. that's when i became very startled and knew for sure this was something very different. at that time it moved directly toward us. the light became bigger as it approached us. at that time i called my friend to report what we were seeing. it was two or three houses away from us at its closest distance but quite a bit higher than the rooftops. the light was about the size of a basketball according to my mother in law. honestly i was a little too flustered to be able to remember the size of it by that time. i do remember it never made any sound. as it was passing by us my mother-in-law looked at it through binoculars. she said it had two rows of dull blue lights all evenly spaced. the craft turned sharply to the east and slightly north right in front of us and move very quickly out of sight. any normal craft would have stayed in our sight for quite a while because we had an open sky with nothing to impede our view for a very long distance. but it was gone so fast!\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

to see how everyone was doing and was not in the swimming pool with everyone at that time.\r\n my youngest grand daughter who is five noticed what she saw was a shooting star, about that same time i noticed several reddish/orange balls of light. at first there was only three which i thought were unusual and the i noticed three more just above tree level off at a distance. it was hard to tell the distance since it was night and there were some clouds in the sky.\r\n i asked what everyone just saw and they said almost the same thing i had just witnessed myself, i went inside and retrieved a pair of binoculars and tried to get a better look at them and they were still fuzzy. i tried my cell phone camera and it would not take a picture because it was to far away. the lights moved several times one in and out of the clouds and another made a drop and joined the other three lights above tree level after about two-three minutes two lights moved off into the distance and the other four lights left as well two of the appeared to vanish.\r\n there are no military areas where we live however there are some strip mining areas in the area. some of the property is owed by aep and was a wildlife area until it was closed off this past year and signs were placed to keep people out do to sinkholes in the area. \r\nthe ages of all the witnesses are 60,58 31,13,9 and 5. myself i am a retired male age 60 who has been trained over the past 42 years to observe the unusual after being in the marine corps and being an ex- deputy sheriff as well as a private investigator and correctional officer and a contract security officer for homeland security. one thing i can add to this report is the way the lights in the sky acted they moved around like no aircraft or helicopter i have ever seen. the balls of light had a reddish/orange glow to them which if checked with any federal regulations on aircraft lighting is highly improper.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then

2015. i observed it/them as the setting sun approached each occurrence of the sightings. there were multiple nights i observed floating, glowing orbs from hornbrook ca, and montague ca. what made me first notice the object/objects was looking up at the sky and realizing logically that what i was seeing was not a star, and definitely no form of commercial aircraft. also seeming otherworldly. when i first noticed it i believed the object to be otherworldly due to my deductive reasoning and the unknown origin of the seeming like what was a bonded light spacecraft of some sort. i tried to rationalize that maybe it was a star. but i started to notice as nights differed they were in different places and placements. then one evening close to dusk, what really opened my eyes to this/these as a ufo for the first time. i observed one moving in a motion unlike any aircraft i had ever seen. one of these \"orbs\" of light flew over me, and drifted out of sight before i knew it. another night i observed one fly toward my direction, it was over montague ca, then real quick went straight back in the opposite direction, where it came from. my feelings were baffled. i had come to terms i had witnessed what i believe to be an unidentified flying object. mainly my feelings were, why is this, and why/ how can, the people of this world not be informed of the other life outside our atmosphere, and sometimes within our atmosphere. another account one evening i saw one fly over my from south to the north and the what seemed to zig zag, unlike any aircraft ability i have ever seen.  but the most vivid eye opener i saw on my drive home from hornbrook to montague one evening. i witnessed a pair of these flying objects in the sky hovering in place but this night seeming like they got lower then ever, i watched them start off high over black mountain and then drift lower and lower till they drifted below black mountain, as i was heading home i saw them on the other side, seeming at a lower elevation than that of black mountain. i was in disbelief. i then realized it seemed i was driving around them as they stayed in place. i was thinking, \"this is crazy\". then what made me assure of this sighting, i saw a commercial airline high in the sky flying at a way higher altitude then these orbs of light. and at that moment realized i was staring at ufo's within our atmosphere, right up and close. my mind was blown and baffled that i have not been taught that these otherworldly entities exist and not only that, but are in our atmosphere, here on earth. the world should know, and generations should be told. everyone has the right to know these other beings are out there, and probably countless of species at that.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path
