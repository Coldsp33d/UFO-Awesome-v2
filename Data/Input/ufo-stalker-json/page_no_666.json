was walkin down my interior house stairs and saw what looked like a commercial aircraft at first. i've seen ufo's in this direction before so i watched closely. the object was a flat disc with mullticoloured lights flashing around it at random times. this was a hint that the aircraft was not an air plane. it flew from south to north at different speeds and then stopped. i was just about to run to get my camera when i heard a deep rumble and kept watching. the ufo started moving backwards and then stopped. after this, the object started moving slowly upwards straight into the sky and then suddenly darted directly up and i lost sight of it within 2 seconds. about 15 seconds after the ufo disappeared, i heard a very deep rumbling sound.\r\n\r\nat this moment i didn't think much, but then it occured to me that i felt like someone was watching me. at the very moment i am writing this (10-15 mins after event) i keep constantly checking over my shoulder to see if anyone is there. i have seen ufo's before and this one was probably the second most beliveable one i've ever seen. another time a yellow disc hovered over my house for over 20 minutes. i called the local air forse base and they said a blip was showing on the radar and then disappeared less than 60 seconds into the call. i never wrote a complete report like this one.\r\n\r\ni really hope others who saw this event do come foward and share their sighting as a report. i would love to see others backing up my sighting. i know i saw it, i know it was real. i have not taken any medication in the last month and have had no drugs since then either.\r\n\r\nsorry if the drawing is unclear, i just had to do a quick sketch and i'm no artist.","distance":"Over One

wasnt always going the same speed it would stop then it was in slight curves then jump back in a different direction. then it moved so fast it went in a straight line and got smaller and then

a fiery orange, and it wasn't blinking as you see planes and helicopters doing.  the object did not move much, but it did move a little, and primarily was in a straight line.  it moved in a south to south east direction from where we first saw it.  the sighting lasted anywhere from five to seven minutes.  there were times that the light would fade.  it could still be seen sometimes, though there was no light.  other times, it would turn it's light off, and then later it would come back on: it did this three or four times.  a few minutes later, we saw a helicopter on the horizon, and we lost sight of the object after it dimmed completely.  the experience left me feeling a bit strange, and somewhat paranoid.

and/or loss of credibility. when i was 9 years old we lived in a rental farm house in the country (southern indiana). at that time, there were few farmhouses in the area as most of the countryside was tree covered with lots of vegetation. we did not have indoor plumbing and in fact we had to use an outhouse about 150 feet from the house. as was my usual routine, i needed to relieve myself very early in the morning. that morning, as i was opening the kitchen door, i looked up and was in shock as i witnessed a very large saucer shaped aircraft hovering over our farm house. i was terrified and immediately went upstairs and woke my mother. she did not believe me and thought i was imagining the craft. i can still vividly see in my minds eye the craft as it silently hovered about 100 feet over the house. it was clearly observable with approximately 3/4ths of the craft in open view. the remainder of the craft was not visible as it was obscured by the roof of our house. i once casually mentioned this event when i was in my 20's as a young army soldier. i was immediately laughed at and was called \"hey ufo\". i tried to mitigate the flack i was receiving and told the men i worked with (who i thought i could trust) that i was just kidding. so for years, i kept this to myself and filed it away.\r\n\r\n2nd encounter:\r\nbtw, i am a retired us army veteran and while on active duty, had a top secret security clearance. i am now a career employee currently working for the federal government. i feel compelled to say this: i am telling this now because i do not want to go to my grave without doing so. at this point in my life i could care less if the whole world laughs at me. but you know what, it is true and i know what i saw. now, lets go forward to 1980. while stationed at the us military academy at west point ny, i was a member of the w.P. rod & gun club but i only fished. one beautiful saturday i had been fishing on a remote lake for much of the day. as the sun was setting, approx 7pm) i was on the lake by myself, fishing in the middle of the lake. all of a sudden, i got the strangest feeling that i've never had before. it was as though the hair on my neck was standing up and i sensed a tingling sensation all over. the feeling of emanate danger was all consuming to the point that i started to panic. i said to myself, what in the world is wrong with me and tried to shrug it off. the feeling persisted and as i looked at the high hills across the lake, i noticed an incredible fog bank. it appeared to be solid and had the appearance of mashed potatoes. again, i've fished this and surrounding lakes numerous times and never experienced such an event. this fog bank was like a curtain being drawn and was uniformly descending toward the lake. i immediately started my small motor and made a dash toward the dock. by the time i reached the dock, the fog had reached the far side of the lake but continued to come toward me. i left my fishing gear on the dock and ran to my van. i started the engine and floored the gas pedal. from round pond to the highway was about 3/4ths of a mile. when i was in sight of the highway, something flew over my van at a very high rate of speed. when it passed my van, a series of flashing lights (red/yellow/orange) flashed in through the windshield. it lit up my van and was gone in a flash. now that's my story. i did not then, nor do i now have an explanation of why these events happened but they did and i feel relieved that i've finally told it to someone who may believe me. thanks for allowing me to tell my accounts of these incidents.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s), Patterned

observed it as we drove closer to it going about 40mph. as we approached the lights a very large, black triangle shaped object became visible as we were no longer directly facing the lights. the object was not pointed like a spear, it was more elongated. the hight was about a city bus or perhaps a big thicker. the object was right next to the rd hovering or moving slowly forward directly over the tree line. as we were directly beside the object i slowed the car down, but did not stop, i looked at it as we passed it. it was black, no lights underneath and was completely silent. i had yet to process what i was looking at. as i passed it, i looked in my side mirror and the object had risen above the tree line a bit, and had a row of lights running across the entire length. the lights were white, but about 1/4 the brightness of the front lighrs. i asked my son \"did you see that?\" he said \"yes!!\" i again turned and looked back but the object was either gone or turned off the lights. i did not see the object fly away, it just wasnt there anymore. i asked my son \"what did you see? he said \"a huge black triangle!\" he became frightened and did not want to turn around. we continued down the rd and did not see anything else. he described exactly what i saw without me describing first.

there also is a well, it is shaped & looks like a christmas tree with all green lights that is way up in the atmosphere-with the stars--near my home. listen either i need to get out of town or they need to go find another universe to haunt because this one belongs to humans & im not seeking to venture out & explore & this just really petrified me!!!! yes i've included emotion and feelings you asked& these are the facts as they occurred on thursday july 23rd 2015 sorry i didn't look at the clock before i went out   tell me if you can answer me this-why do they come in the stealth of night???? why won't they come in broad sunlight so all humans can see them- you see if it weren't for their lights we wouldn't know they were here unless you heard the steady drone of their object  if mufon has communication with these entities perhaps you would convey my message to them-let us live in peace-leave us humans alone!!!!\r\non a clear nite-no overcast/clouds you can see the christmas tree blinking & sometimes moving  please don't discount the person who was in ronkonkoma ny & saw it as big as an 18 wheeler--they described similar to what i saw our dates visualizing were not far apart & he's within 10-15 minutes from my home-so is maccarthur airport\r\ni couldn't take any pictures because it happened so quickly & my cellphone was on charge.  i do have a sketch drawn on the 24th, but i don't know how to get it onto this to send you   if you call me i can send the sketch i drew with notes on it to your phone-i know how to do this  please don't come to my home-i don't want my neighbors alarmed & thinking i did something bad & having all these gov't people here .","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":69612,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7972923,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08202015-0032","longitude":-73.0591881,"occurred":1437609600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1440103734000,"summary":"I drew a picture of it enormous 3 extended \"arms\" 1arm was longer /all 3 had white oval lights. 1 blue & then several pink lights in a row on longest arm flashing. color-flat black","tags":["lights","flash"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":28,"maxtempi":83,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":73,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":63,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":28,"maxtempi":83,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":73,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":63,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"11741","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":28,"locationName":"Holbrook, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:11539"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":666}
