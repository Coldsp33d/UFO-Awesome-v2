was over 1500 hundred people that reported it. we were coming from up north there had been snow mobil racing so the traffic was at a snails pace bumper to bumper then all of a sudden this flying saucer shows up  out in the distance it dances back and forth across the highway then it positions itself up over the highway and starts descending at a fast rate of speed that it was obvious that it was no way it could stop before it crashed into everybody so all of the cars started to pull over and run into the woods it was such a panic that i saw cars rolling with no occupants because the people didn't have time to turn the engines off i saw people running with their children running behind them. everybody got off the road except me and my friend, i was screaming my head off for her to pull over that its going to crash!She looked at me and said its just a falling star i said are you crazy cant you see all the people running, she then said again very calmly (its just a falling star)i begged her to pull over and let me out. then just as the u.F.O got ready to crash into our car it stopped on a dime.It started going backwards as we proceeded forward.Then the craft got on my side of the car and i could tell it was taking data of me. the car was illuminated with light i crouched down on the floor with my hands over my head and she repeated its just a falling star. then it flew out into the distance when i got home it was on the news. but the most profound experience i had was so out of this world that would be willing to take a polygraph exam. i had direct contact with these

lights. invisible rays of energy and pressure was being applied to my body and head. i thought it was coming through the windows so i moved away from them. no matter where i went inside my house to get away, the rays followed. they even followed me into the basement. so the entity came into the house through walls,closed doors and windows. the substance being aimed at me was rapidly dehydrating my body. the entity led me out of my house by using telepathy and making me afraid to be in my home. i went to a hotel with my children but it followed me there. this time it beamed massive amounts of energy into my body and aimed lasers at my head non-stop causing severe pain to the point i almost went unconscious. the energy being aimed at me affect ed the microwave causing it to spark. it also affected the lights causing them to flicker. the entity beamed something into my heart.Afterward i experienced pain and burning inside my heart. something was also implanted inside my back without any surgical procedure. this object causes burning sensations and tremors around my back and heart area. this entity seemed to absorb or extract something from my body that caused me to have immediate and intense cramping all over my body. i was taken to a hospital and a mysterious fluid was injected into me that caused my heart to burn intensely and my heart rate decreased. my 7 year old son told me he felt as if a ghost was watching him. i felt the same. as if being watched inside my home. the entity appeared to be peering from behind my head or had directly got inside my head. however, it seemed to be attaching itself to my head.\r\nwhere ever i go it follows as if it has a tracking device on me. no one can see it but i could feel and sense it's presence. it circulated in and around my body as if it was making a copy of me or downloading something from every part of my body. i could feel it go inside my body. this was not painful.\r\ni have moved to a different address and the entity has followed me. since the injected medicine i have been experiencing pain and sickness.A substance such as electromagnetic radiation,electricity,microwave currents or some other substance is almost always being aimed at me, even while i sleep. i can feel my brain being altered and my body seems to be being damaged. \r\ni have witnessed the entity take possession of certain people around

stay the weekend in a friends cabin. we were just passing eileson air force base when i noticed a light. i said to my friends, when did they put up that tower. when we got closer i noticed three white lights. this is when we pulled to the side of the road. we noticed the three white lights about two hundred feet apart forming a triangle. in between the lights was an outline of a black craft. it was a dull matte black blocking out the stars in the night sky. the craft was hovering just above the spruce trees. black spuce in alaska do not grow very tall so i would estimate it being about fifty feet off the ground. it was completely silent. we watched it for around four minutes until one of the passengers said, let's just leave them be. so we did. we drove off and continued on our way. we

old at the time, we all saw this object, i clearly remember it was rectangular in shape approximately 1.5-2.0 meters high approx 6metres wide by 10 meters long \r\nwas silver in color ,was silent had no engine noise, had bright pulsating lights which emitted unevenly\r\nmy dad grabbed his shot gun an we ,my dad an i walked over to it while my mum watched from the shed\r\nmy dad yelled out at it telling them to piss off ,get off my property before i shoot ya, ya bastards\r\nbut we couldn't see anyone \r\nmy dad was upset because it had upset the cows they were uneasy not settled\r\ni was more interested in what it was an who was driving it, how was it possible to sit above the trees an the trees weren't moving\r\nlike the lights was holding it up,\r\nmy dad an i stood there for at least 10minutes just looking at it\r\n10-15 meters from it, as we were almost directly under it at this stage\r\nwe could hear a hum of some description like a speaker drone\r\nthe lights slowly increased speed rotating the object \r\nthen started rising up with no engine noise\r\nwe walked backwards away from it as i think my dad was afraid of it as it was like nothing we had ever seen before, an something that made it even more strange was the object started to turn over like a wind mill,like walking up a flight of stairs that's how it moved it moved directly into the path of the sun rising, we watched for 5minutes or so till it was out of site, as we walked back to the shed my dad told me not to talk to anyone or tell people about it or they will think we are crazy/mad an telling stories about things we don't under stand,\r\nyears later when i was in my teens i would speak to my mum about it an she would say it was definitely something not from our time an best we don't talk about it, as for my dad he don't want to talk about it, just told me to forget about it, its in the pass,\r\nim now a 52 year old grand father i have told my 2 daughters ,wife about it my grandsons are to young just yet\r\n\r\ni strongly believe that day that something happened to me that ive never got over like i never feel alone an i have experienced some really serious death accidents an health issues that can not be explained,\r\none that is still fresh in my mind is i was driving into work one morning on the fwy-way had the cruz control set to 110kms/hr when out of no way a deer jumped in front of my car smashed the whole area i was in an i remember climbing out of the car an looking at it saying to myself how could i possible survive this accident like its impossible i should be dead, ive survived at least 10 maybe more, id really like to speak to someone, ill wait for a reply i think of said enough, thanks marc \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

headed on a camping, fishing trip on kentucky lake. my age would have been around 14 to 15 years at the time.  we packed our 16’ aluminum fishing boat with two motors (10hp & 71/2 hp johnsons), all the gas tanks (i think we had 3 tanks) we had and a cooler with bacon and egg, sandwich makings/hot dogs and drinks. we planned on traveling by boat to areas of the lake that were new to us. we were going to explore new areas, look for fossils and indian fire pits, and fish. our fishing boat was relatively slow by today’s standards and at the late afternoon of the first day we had gone up the tn river and reached a very small bay upstream and north of the leatherwood creek areas of the lake and fished there. we thought about spending the night there but the shore was too narrow to provide a good camping area. we moved on to leatherwood creek which is a big bay. we fished a bit in leatherwood creek bay and decided to make camp early since we were not familiar with the area. we made camp in the bay on the south side of leatherwood creek. there was a steep cliff behind us and we used the back drop of the cliff as a fire backstop. we made dinner early, gathered firewood, spread out our sleeping bags and decided to go to bed early and shortly after sunset since our flashlights were not that good in those days. in the 50-60’s the entire shore of the lake was wild and not inhabited with any fishing camps or cabins. the only two docks where we could get gas were antioch and buchanan and they were very little docks with one gas pump.  in fact, in those days we rarely saw another fishing boat on the lake and we took our baths in the lake. so, going to bed early was the only option for us. we got in our sleeping bags but shortly after, for some reason, we decided to take the boat out and try night fishing. we built the fire up quite big so we could see it from the lake to ensure we could get back to camp. we fished a short time and decided to get back to shore because a fog was coming in and we were afraid we might not get back to our camp if the fog obscured our view of the camp fire. when we got back to camp, i was glad we built up the fire as it was burned down quite low. after getting back to shore and pulling the boat up on the bank, we saw a floating round light across the bay and floating along the tree line at the top of the hill. it was floating along the north side of leatherwood creek and moving from the east in a westward direction. it was a color like the sun, and about the size of a pea or my little finger nail from our distance perspective.  it was moving at a speed i would guess to be about 10 miles per hour and hovering just above tree tops and there was no sound at all. it floated along the ridge for probably several hundred yards and then went over the hill and out of sight only to reappear a couple hundred yards farther away to our left. finally it floated out of sight. we went to bed and slept well. \r\n\r\nthe funny thing was that while the 60’s were the age of the very popular and plentiful flying saucer and alien invasion movies, we should have been quite afraid of what we saw, but we were not. as example, on another time we returned to the cabin late in the evening from a movie in town. on the gravel county road near the cabin, we saw a huge glowing mound in the woods. to our imaginations it appeared to be a crashed ufo but on a closer look it was the embers left from a brush pile fire. i remember at first not knowing what it was and being afraid that it was a crashed ufo or something like the meteors from the war of the worlds movie. so, why in this case we had fear of what we saw but in the orb of leatherwood creek, we were not? what accounts for the difference?\r\n\r\nthat weekend our father came to the cabin from memphis where he worked. we told him our story and told him we thought it was a “will-o'-the-wisp” (see wikipedia below). he said that it probably was and that he saw one as a young boy. dad said it was a ball of light that floated in through his bedroom window, floated down the hall and went out through the screen of the screen door. he went on to tell us that in the memphis news papers there had been a story that a big ufo had been seen over nashville that same week. if you were to draw a straight line along that ridge on leatherwood creek and extend it south east, it would run near nashville area. so, it is possible that we saw the same thing. it certainly was not any flying vehicle we know. if it were a helicopter with a spot light on it, it would not have appeared as a ball of light unless the spot light was pointing directly at us the entire length of its movements and we would have heard the rotors. so, we can rule out a chopper. \r\n\r\nthis summer i went to leatherwood creek and found the cove where we camped. looking across the bay i covered an object about the size of a pea from that distance. it is the restaurant now there in the marina (which wasn't there in 59). the size of the restaurant is probably 100’ in length, so the yellow/white sphere we saw must have been about 100’ in diameter and likely more as it was higher up the hill than the marina. most all reports of “will-o’-the-wisp” are of small orbs of light the largest the size of a man’s head. this light was much larger than that, so it is unlikely it was a will-0-the-wisp. what it was, i don’t know…we’ll just say an unexplained large, slow moving ball of light out in the boonies and seen in the late 50’s.  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

bright out. i looked up facing west there was a vary bright light that was turning on and off randomly i told the kids to take a look at this and i asked them what do they think it was they did not know either but we all were amazed seeing the object/light. i told them this thing is strange as it would get vary bright and then dim some then get bright again and some times turn off. i told them to keep an eye on the object and that i was going to the house to get my cell phone to take some pics of it. i ran to the house and got the phone and when i came out the object was gone i asked them what happened and they just said it was gone and as i was standing there looking for it the light came back on but it was in a different location. it did all of the same things as before that is when i took a couple of pics of it and watched it for a while then it was gone again. i sat down and looked for it to show up again and it did this time in a new location. i took a few more pics of it and then i tried to record it with my phone but it just would not  show up on the recording but it did show up in the pics i took. we watched it for a few more minutes and then it was gone and did not come back.The next night we had two helicopters going around in circles at about the same time we seen the object the night before. the front helicopter did not have any lights on at all no strobes or anything which i thought was strange and it was a larger helicopter. the other was a smaller one and it did have the strobe flashing on the bottom of it. it looked as if they were searching for something or following something.\r\nabout a week later the helicopters came back around the same time 10:30 pm and the did the same thing as before.I could not figure out why on lights on

and we all decide to walk to the deli for a six-pack. it had been a hot sunny sat. afternoon and the sun was going down. we would always cut across the local school field and did that evening. night had just fallen and as we were passing the backstop of the ball field i noticed a plane approach from e/ne. this was a common flight path for jets going southwest to jfk, so i glanced, but...It caught my eye because it moved slowly like a jet at a far distance yet was as low as a cesna type single engine private plane which we were used to because of deer park airport being blocks away. i did a double take because it was so slow and low it would have fallen into pilgrim state woods, and it made no sound. i said,\"look at that!\"\r\n  a round disc craft with multi-colored lights flashing in a circular but erratic manner comes right toward us. it reminded me of the saucers in \"the invaders\" tv show of the sixties; lights revolving on the bottom outer edge. this was erratically flashing; hypnotically. we all felt that it was a self-aware machine; we could feel it looking at us. it was so close to us i later told others i could have hit it with a wrist-rocket(illegal slingshot)but not with a rock by hand; approx.200 ft. while passing directly overhead it turned a bright blue light on us. we felt it 'awarely' scan us with an intense static charge;our hair stood on end and the smell of electricity was powerful(reminded me of my h o train set when a boy). it scanned my thoughts and being, not just our bodies! i remember looking at frankie's hair standing up. the next thing i knew it was moving away or had it never slowed over us i don't know; strangely disorienting for all of us i later learned.\r\n  \"what was that?!\" i exclaimed. frankie calmly says \"the gardeners\" and points toward the neighborhood sky which was filled with about 7-9 more moving in a grid pattern(monitoring/mapping?)over the town. he had just read \"the hermit'by lobsang rampa which explained the

10 o'clock flying over a mountain to the north end of tremonton, utah. the object was shaped very similar to a paraglider, although the object had nothing dangling beneath, nor did it have the actual cells of a paraglider. it was a very very dark grey in color. the two most frightening, or interesting features of this object were its size, it was at least 500 yards from tip tip, and 200 from stern to aft, the second, most striking feature was that it would fade into invisibility, to full visibility, and did so repeatedly, all while in its constant doing its constant figure 8 parallel to the surface of the mountain. it did so until the object remained invisible, and didn't come back. the ordeal lasted several minutes.","distance":"Over One
