one of our first dates,we were standing on the for the porch just talking and getting to know each other better we then noticed so star like lights moving around in the sky,they were all at the same time but in different directions moving up,down,left,right but we're in a cluster in the same direction but moving in different directions. when we first saw the objects we knew that they could be nothing else but ful's we looked at them and looked each other and immediately knew nothing like this was from this planet(they were to far away and moving like nothing in this world). after watching them for at least fifteen minutes or so we said to each other that this was so weird and that nobody would ever believe us, so at that time we made a packed never to tell anyone or discuss it again. so we watched them doing the same thing for another fifteen twenty minutes when we decided it was getting late and we left each other, they were still there when we left. we never really discussed it again but this secret i believe helped the trust in our relationship. now this is the weird part years later after we had our first child(about 10 12 yrs)in a different location we were walking into an applebee's restaurant, while walking through the parking lot we saw the same exact thing this time there were a few more witnesses. this time i knew more about ufo's and abductions so as fast as they were moving and the distance they were covering i was scared, it just felt like they could be in front of us so fast i had a weird feeling like we could be abducted. i don't know what that felling was so we stopped watching and went in to the restaurant. we never so this again, i could show the exact places and directions they still are there. i have never seen this on any tv

balloon or soccer ball and moved very slow.I feel like it was talking to me in my head but without words.It came back a few more times.I finally got my mother to see it one night..Worried her a little..She was unsettled about it.This next thing is why i'm telling you this cause i need answers so...I was laying on the couch watching tv..And i felt like someone was watching me in from the hallway i felt something different bout the feelings i was having.I looked back again towards the hallway and that's when i noticed a light coming out of the ceiling in the living room. i watched it ,it was so cool looking golden white light and then it started producing a bit of red light in the beam the red lights started to form like a diamond shape inside the beam..And that's when i thought \"oh damn\" so i called out for someone to wake up so they could see it too..(i called for my mom)but i was unable to speak ..I felt like something wouldn't let me talk...So i tried harder cause now im freaking out cause they wont let me speak so i had to try really hard to scream...As soon as i got out a loud \"mom\" it was as if i just woke up from a nightmare\\dream but it was not!I was in the same position on the couch and the show i was watching wasn't on anymore..I lost time but do not know how long. ..After this happened i have seen triangle crafts. orbs,two crafts that remind me of \"jacks\" the little silver jacks you play with with that little rubber ball,but they were not small,and they made the power lines hum ...I have seen entities, matter in fact bigfoot showed up in my back yard during this time..I am going through changes..An awakening if you will.This is hard to talk about.It wouldn't bother me if they just asked but i feel manipulated and violated...I just need to talk to someone that knows im not crazy.  there are a couple more events but this is the one that bothers me.Thank you for you time and efforts to understand these beings.My mom and sister saw the

that day may have been.\r\n\r\nmy husband and i were visiting family members in western kansas sometime ago in the fall of 2004. we had gone to an area called castle rock approx south southeast of quinter kansas. this area is open range with pasture, chalk rock formations.\r\n\r\nas we were leaving the area i noticed some cottonwood trees and horses that i wanted to take some pictures of. i pulled over and getting out i took my 35 mm camera and color film over to the fence where the horses were. i recall taking a few photos of the turning colors of the cottonwood trees and of the horses. i noted that i still had a few blank shots left and decided to just take some random pot shots not really aiming at anything so i could \"finish\" the roll and put in a fresh roll.\r\n\r\ni started to walk in front of our vehicle clicking away with the camera. i don't remember getting into the vehicle itself. i remember that i was sitting in the drivers seat next,changing out the roll and talking to my husband. i started the car and left. several days later we were back home in new hampshire.\r\n\r\ni took my film to our local camera store( which has since gone out of business and the owner has died) and picked it up several days later. the owner wanted me to open the envelope and take a look at my shots. near the end of the roll was a \"black and white\" shot with a \"squashed purple\" object suspended in air in the middle of the shot. the owner had no clue nor did the other employees there as to what this was.\r\n\r\nwe made some wild guesses. but the owner stated that it was showing up on the negative and they could not detect any manipulation of the film. my husband and i were and still are friends with a former mufon investigator. we sent a copy of the photo to him. he was unable to detect anything that would indicate manipulation or damage to the photo. \r\n\r\ni had carefully stored the negative in a safe place, our home. but over the years i have tried to locate that negative and have not been able to find it. we have shown this photo to several experienced people and they do not have a clue. it concerns me that maybe my husband and i had an event that we have suppressed so deeply we can't recall. all we have is this photo. please keep in mind that i nor my spouse saw anything during that event, as far as we know.  \r\n\r\ni submitted this story to the mufon editor and he asked me to download it to this website. i give permission to any staffer(s) that would like to look into this and maybe finally give us an answer.

was instantly aware of a mechanical presence\r\nstanding in the doorway of my bedroom. i saw a beam of light scan my body.\r\nthe impression i received was \"i'm just here to do a job.\" since the light was still on in my bedroom i tried to move from my sleeping position to \r\nsee what was going on. i realized i was paralyzed and couldn't call\r\nfor my dog. i think i feel asleep, because i remember awakening again\r\nand i was lying on my stomach with a beam of light moving back and forth\r\nover the area of my chest to my hips. the next beam of light caused extreme pressure in the same area. the pressure beam continued many times\r\nuntil i started to fear for my life. later on, i awoke as normal in the\r\nmorning. i instantly recalled the prior events, knowing that it wasn't a\r\ndream. within 30 hours since the event, my doctor performed an upper gi\r\nprocedure and found that my ulcers had been cured. prior to my visitation,\r\ni had been in agony with pain coming from ulcer area. i had planned to go to the er that morning. also unusual was that i heard the sound of a distant cell phone ringing constantly until after midnight of the same\r\nnight as the visit. there were no other cell phones in my home that could\r\nmake that noise. i thought it was important to report this event because\r\nit shows that et can do

drinking a cup of coffee.  i was watching a couple of doves in a pecan tree.  then a squirrel jumped out of the tree onto the roof of the apartments across the street.  the squirrel was running across the peak of the roof about midways of the building.  i was facing almost directly south when i noticed a triangular shaped object just above and to the left of the squirrel, coming at me at a high rate of speed.  it was like a blurry triangular shape with a fuzzy, medium brown outline. it appeared to be a perfect triangular shape with one point up. the color of the body of the object appeared transparent, as it seemed to change color to match the sky and the clouds as it went past.  i would guess the cloud cover to be at an altitude of about 1200 to 1300 feet.  the object was flying under the clouds.  the total time elapsed from the time it caught my eye to when it was out of sight was 3 seconds.  there was no sound, no emissions, nothing but the sight of the object flying by.  the speed of the object startled me and caused me to catch and hold my breath.  i have never seen anything like it before.  i know it wasn't just a formation of birds or anything like that because it was a perfect geometric shape.  it appeared to be flying faster than the jets that fly over at the university of texas graduation ceremonies and the f4 jets i have seen at airshows.  it was flying so fast that my eyes were only able to focus on it momentarily and that's when i noticed 3 lighter brownish fuzzy lines equidistantly spaced in the body of the object.  i also noticed at that time when it was almost directly above me that it appeared to be an elongated triangular shape.  the two sides of the triangle were approximately 3 times the length of the back.  the only way i could try to estimate the size of the object was to raise my arm and hold my thumb and forefinger apart at about the size of the length of it in the sky.  that was about 2 inches total length.  considering the height of the clouds and the length the object appeared to be as it flew under the clouds it might be possible to estimate its length.  to me it seemed to be about 1/2 to 2/3 the length of an f4 fighter jet.  it flew in a perfectly straight line with no weave or bobble.  i mentioned this incident to a neighbor lady who said i ought to report it.

been several time and place diruptions.There were no landmark indicators date time location groupings to set as a baseline for these expariments.Several ufo researchers when trying to understand the alien technowedgies are having difficulties due to time displacements.This is the key the scientists are looking for.Time and distance have been affected.There is only a small amount of time left to put some things the way they were supposed to be.Places are missing the experiments as i said before are causing alternatative outcomes.These outcomes have resulted in outcomes which result in

debris, breaking off of it. i have seen meteors in the past but this seemed much larger, about a half, to a third of the size of a compact car; moved slower, glowed brighter and actually seemed to have landed in / around the hudson river. possibly where gory brook meets the hudson. i couldnt tell if it just stopped glowing (burned out if a meteor) and went into darkness, or if it collided with the water. it also seemed to move in kind of an arc rather than a strait line, but this may have just been my viewing angle.  my observation of the object lasted about 7 seconds, not counting the few

it was red and orange in color swirling together inside but had a dim glow around the outside edges. i was stunned at first but became extremely curious having never seen anything like this before. i felt completely at peace and felt a welcoming since of love, as if it knew me and it was welcoming me to embrace it. i can remember i had a big smile on my face and i reached up and with a hand on each side of it i pushed in to see what it felt like. i'm a child mind you but my explanation of how it felt was like a marsh mellow, when i pushed in it pushed back. my experience lasted maybe one minute and then i blacked out walking up the next morning in aww. the very next night it reappeared exactly as it had the night before. again it allowed me to hold it and i squeezed it as i did before. this experience happened exactly as it had the night before with the same result waking up in the morning totally blown away. for the next week i tried over and over to do exactly what i had done those two night before, wishing it would come back but it didn't. this changed my life forever but that isn't it. i've had two separate experiences from the orb visitations several years later. into one case, contact was made with one tall, and one short grey where i entered a small circular craft. i was at a secluded area where i kept my horses and as i walked to the corral i was stopped by a 7 to 8 foot tall grey, but the face of the grey had the imagage of my sisters face and she told me it was alright and to go ahead where a small grey walked me to the craft. when i entered i saw another tall grey standing across from me inside the craft and as i walked to the center of the craft i could see what appeared to a radial shaped control panel to my left with a window above it. the small grey told me we would be going straight up and coming straight down and that was the last thing i remember until i was back in the corral. the other event happened at the same location in the back hills where the nearest neighbor was a quarter mile away. i don't know why i decided to walk up a remote path but towards the end of it was a similar sized craft where i saw only one tall grey but this time it didn't have my sisters face. i remember walking towards the being and the next thing i remember was walking back down the path towards the corral wondering what i was doing. since then i have done nothing but research the ufo phenomenon. i cant quench this thirst for knowledge and have finally decided to reach out for answers and help. i've had regressive hypnosis done but i was unable to be hypnotised. i have the evidence to prove i'm not a fraud, i have one triangular scoop mark that has faded pretty badly, but i have a recent one from 10 years ago that you can still stick the tip of your pinky finger in and clearly see its triangular shape. my wife can testify as to the two brown crusty scabs on the same calf as the scoop mark that i received in the same event and didn't go away for two years although they did leave a scar. my case is real, alien life forms have found an interest in me since i was a little boy and i dont know what it is. my life was changed forever by these events and i just want to talk to someone who knows more about this mysterious thing we call our universe than myself. i am educated holding a ba in sociology from sdsu and three aas from sdcc. its time for me to share my experience with specialist like mufon, so please, please respond to me if only to have someone who understands this better than me give me a path to support
