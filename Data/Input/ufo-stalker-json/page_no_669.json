(i have lived here for fifteen years and have never seen this before).\r\nas their engines faded into the distance i returned to lining up the telescope, at first i thought it was my eyes , but just to the right hand side of a cloud, the sky seemed to ripple , similar to when a stone is dropped into water.\r\nit became apparent it was not my eyes, the object flickered and moved down in the direction of my house.  it continued to flicker as if trying to camouflage , as one moment you could see it, and the next moment you could not, almost matching the sky itself. \r\nit hovered approximately 70-80 feet above my house, by then i could see it was a craft of triangle shape, no lights present, nil noise except a low humming. the moon light caught the underside of the craft as it turned , centrally at the underside , i saw what looked red engine ports, protruding in pairs, with almost static sparks shooting across the pairs.\r\nas i was watching this, the hairs on my arms and neck seemed to stand up. i could see then this was a manmade object, not an illusion.\r\ni still had my laser pointer , used for pointing out starts in the night sky, which i shone on the craft , and the beam stopped, which would only occur with a solid object. \r\nafter approximately 30 seconds the craft moved off , at first slowly, then accelerated at a rapid and shocking rate. \r\nthats` my story. i know this would have been noted on the local airport radar, which is luton, bedfordshire, approximately 15 miles away. but when i tried to get further information from them they refused to

it wasnt possible. to this i lamented by lying down on my steps. as i looked into the northwest sky i saw a red and white object(thought it a plane)zip over to my rt and absorb another bright white object then it reversed in a downward motion and grabbed yet another smaller dimmer white object then it began to blink red and white and bleu lights. i screamed for others to come as i had no phone. finally my neighbors 2 downstairs came out and argued over what it could be as it sat high in the sky not movinhg almost like mimicing a star. my son brought out this laptop and a phone. i dialed and reported to no avail the local police arrived and saw the trail it left when it moved but this time it only manuvered a bit, so he said it wa a twinkle and that it was just a star  i never took my eyes from the object the entire time it was over us then after a lot odd manuvers it slowly moved northwest toward areas known as old lycoming, trout run, rock run it finally crested a mountain where it painfully hoovered for 20 or more minutes before finally disappearing from our sight. a roomate from downstairs came in at the last hour and sat with me while we called the pentagon they asked if this phenomon worried us??? they proceeded to dropped our calls repeatly transferred us to the fbi, a defense something or other they dropped the call too. i just kept calling and watching as the object seem to release the smaller white light. it udulated it zigzagged it did rt angles then made little circles.My nephew also saw these same three become one in the southside of the river. it reminded me of surveying a job in a helicopter. or a cartographer type observation but i have never seen three copters attach and detache as it surveyed. it scared me it unnerved me. also, in this almost  5 hrs no dogs barked none. then at an hour into this event or display a fireball, comet or whaterver shot out from the eastern sky like it as over our trees, the object was 30,to 40000 ft from us or so it seemed. soon after the fireball a meteor or shooting star came from same direction but higher same trajectory though. the other thing to note is this object stayed in a dark cloud mass the entire time. you could see aircraft passing it in all directions finally it hoover slowly oh painfully slow over the mountain and i gave up my vigil. i was in a lot of pain after all the standing and arguong but i never once lost sight of the object. i even contacted our moronic local police to inform them the object had moved from our sight. the thing did alot of stuff and 6 of us saw the really inexplicable movements the ofc saw it move. saw what  i would call an expulsion of fuel every time it moved it trailed a stream of three or more lines like a rocket? now, i am being critized, made fun of and will probaly be involved in a physical altercation with the idiots across from us who have three or more adults anda abunch of kids like 6 or more they were all out there as soon as a cop car showed up. they saw it, my 35yr old male neighbor is now saying it didnt move but my son saw it and he isnt the sort to say something because of me in fact the exact opposite we did attept to photograph with cells but it was so far away. i contacted wbrechannel/nbc but they were too bus wnep channel 16/abc and got the same story. at 1227 am i gave up it was gone and no one seemed to care, shake my head... today i rec'd a call from i thing the national guard they are saying it was illuminatin artillery fire in the sw quadron well i live in the ne quad. so, now what? i feel kinda humiliated, but i do not care i know what i saw, period.","distance":"Over One

two years ago. it began late november 2013, at the end of my college fall semester, during school. i was walking to class and was beginning to hear voices saying \"he's a shaman\" and \"he sounds like a broken recorded player\" spoken repeadetely, which i thought was ironic.\r\na week later, before my final class before final tests, i was waiting outside my classroom to start. i was sitting on a bench, meditating with my eyes closed and a girl shows up and places her backpack down on the bench across me. when i open my eyes to see the girl put her pack down, she pauses as if noticing me notice her. at the moment she pauses, i see an orb like sphere warp over her arm and i feel as if she knew what just happened. she backed away and leaned against a wall by her bench. she looked self conscious or shy and passive aggressive (like a bad tired attitude) but out of the norm. at the same time, a boy was walking in a mysterious manner several feet in front of me in a grassy area where one would seem unusual walking the way he was. he was giving me a sinister/cynical look. a few two seconds later, two boys come out from the hall way and meet up with the girl. one said \"what's up anna\" and gestured a fist bump. she said \"what's up\" and sounded very shy/withdrawn. i walked straight to class while that was happening and kept hearing faint unclear voices throughout the whole class session, feeling as if the professor was aware or knew what was going on.\r\n\r\nthe event:\r\nlong story short, the voices became stronger and i began suspecting their presence might have signified something. i didn't want to report this to a mental doctor or family or friend. i wanted to experience it.\r\none night, when the presence of the voices and the feelings i got behind them led me to try something i thought was crazy at the time but wouldn't do any harm. i decided to \"go in\" with the voices/feelings and trust my intuition as if one were expecting an answer to a prayer. i was feeling a weird field of 'something' and it led into the sky, at a particular star. i walked outside behind my apartment to a grassy area. i looked up at the star and said \"go!\" and threw a pointing gesture at it. the moment i di'd that, my eyes flashed and a green light/orb popped out from behind or in front of it and it swirled around the star, one full cycle, in a crooked manner, unusual but in an obvious way that you could tell that this thing was being operated not in a mechanical way. it was not flashing nor pulsating lights. it was just lit green and swirled, crooked. it lasted for about two seconds.\r\nafter the moment this happened, i was mentally overwhelmed by excitiment, for what i have just seen, and fear because i thought that i might have disturbed something or someone.\r\n\r\nafter the event:\r\nagain, long story short, the voices began becoming stronger, clearer and more lively as if the communicators were intelligent like us. to sum it up, i was being contacted by \"evil\" people or what they would call themselves \"angry aliens\" and for nicknames, \"monsters\" or \"vampires\".\r\n\r\nexcuse me for introducing this so boldy and i understand this might sound strong but i feel as i were direct, it would be clearer.\r\n\r\nwhile, all this was happening, the voices, i was experiencing dream like states as well. one was a vision of one of the communicators in a personal spaceship she would dwell in in space just above the earth. she was cussing and swearing at me for communicating with her and spat at her window, directing the spit and anger towards me. i was confused because we were having friendly contact before that so i went ahead and communicated closer to her and she told me \"that i shouldn't be there because her father isn't the happy type\".\r\n\r\nanother powerful vision i had was a grey alien type being handing something to someone taller, the size and shape of a human being.\r\n\r\none experience or vision i had early on was a being the appearance of a reptile being laying an egg in my stomach and said \"yummy tummy for your belly\". it had eyes of snake pupils or snake eyes.\r\n\r\nkey words and phrases commonly said:\r\n- collective consciousness\r\n- blood money\r\n- satanic cult leader\r\n- time dilator (i had a vision of one of the beings dropping a big device the height of a human. i grabbed the device quickly and took off with it. she called it a time dilator and in my vision, i was running away with it as it were the most valuable thing, as if a 1500s human were presented with a high tech modern technology)\r\n- blood (as if saying race) or bloodlines\r\n\r\nthere is too much to write down here. i recorded only some of it on a document in my computer, just in case i wanted to turn it in to someone appropriate. i am not willing to submit it here for personal reasons.\r\n\r\nsome of the experiences were personal and some are difficult to explain. some are violent and vulgar.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

this time from left to right. then the object started to do the same without any turns. it was just a light and i could not hear any sound the usually aircraft has. after observing for around 45 minutes i told my sister to look at the object that. i said \"what kind of aircraft is this; it just moves in zig zag pattern and no turns\". it was at this time when my cousins and sister started observing the object and within 02 of that the object suddenly got frozen in the sky (from zig zag pattern) and started moving towards us. it was bright light moving towards us. i we could not see what is behind  the light as it is coming towards us. there was no sound either. it was getting brighter and brighter as it was approaching us. when it reached about 100 feet above us my sister pulled us to go inside. we started to run away and about to go down the stairs when one of my cousins asked to take a look at the object again so we came back to our original position. what we saw; the object is returning back in the same path as it came i.E. with out turning and then disappeared at far distance. the approx. time when this all ended was about 3:00am.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"01:10:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":69522,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":24.871232199999998,"location":null,"logNumber":"PK-08182015-0007","longitude":67.0125488,"occurred":805774500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Sindh","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1439877615000,"summary":"Light like objet moving in sky","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Asia/Karachi","timeZoneName":"Asia/Karachi","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"75530","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7339,"locationName":"Karachi, Sindh","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:12198"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Värnamo","country":"Sweden","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This is the third report of sightings within the same area. all sightings began with looking westbound towards the värnamo area and the sightings ended either west or north-west within my line of sight. \r\n\r\nthis report covers two nights, august midnight 13th/14th and 14th/15th 2015 where the meteor shower was visible. while the meteorites could be seen all over the sky at random time points, the unidentified objects were observed only around the same area as in the previous reports.\r\n\r\nduring the first night, two objects were seen. the first appeared over venus which was directly west. it appeared suddenly, far off, with a very bright white light as if to capture my attention and drifted off heading north. as it drifted in a constant path, the bright white light faded away until disintegrating. i had first mistaken it to be an extremely bright meteorite but it was moving too slowly to be one, and it could not be a jet as it had no strobe lights -- rather a consistent white light that faded as it moved. duration approximately 15 seconds until fading. the second object that night appeared several minutes later, emerging from the west again and headed north/north-east bound. it was an orb-like object with a surface that could not be seen, save for a pulsating, dull red light as if it were pretending to be a commercial jet. the pulse was far too dull and wide to be a jet, and there were no white strobe lights. it lasted slightly longer than the bright white orb but eventually faded when reaching the north/north-east location.\r\n\r\nthe next night, i had observed a star-like object in what was the same or similar west location as in the first report, year 2011. however, this object was different and could easily be mistaken for a supernova or binary star system like sirius. oddly enough, i had always thought this object to be a star as i had observed it to the north of my location on every occasion prior to this and it appeared stationary. however, during this night the \"star\" was not to the north, but now to the west. i thought this strange and then began to believe my father who was telling me that he saw the object move, and i looked at it more carefully. when focusing careful attention upon it as it flickered chaotically in hues of blue, white, and red, the object would every once in a while perform subtle loops or drifts, and would drift north, and then drift back south. it would ascend or descend, but its position remained relatively the same over the 15 minutes we looked at the object. it remained in the same area when we left.\r\n\r\nwhat purpose all of these objects have remains unknown. the last object to my sense seemed to pose as a star and had no interests other than remaining relatively stationary.

while arriving at a friend's house in fort collins, co. the \"craft\" was moving slowly, and had an orange flame. it was headed west. i was able to get a couple of pictures (which i have attached). \r\n\r\nthe second sighting was at approximately 2:45 am on july 11, 2015, in wellington, co. we were arriving home late (after babysitting at our friend's home). the \"craft\" again had an orange flame, and again, was traveling slowly. this time, the \"craft\" was heading more northwest. i was a little frightened, as it was pretty close to our house, so i did not get any photos that time. the \"craft\" was very quiet (no sound could be heard from it as it went by).\r\n\r\nthe third and last time we witnessed the \"craft\" was at 12:59 am on july 25, 2015, in wellington, co. again, the \"craft\" was traveling slowly, and again, had an orange flame. it was traveling west. this time, i was able to get photos and a video of it. we even went outside, but no sound could be heard coming from it.  \r\n\r\ni don't know what this \"craft\" is, but it seems to be traveling too slow to be a plane. i am hopeful that you might be able to help decipher what it is. thank you so much for your time and assistance.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
