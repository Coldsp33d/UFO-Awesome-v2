picture and apparently the video i took didn't register or didn't store to my phone now in the picture you can see reflection of car lights but the one small light in the middle is one of what i saw of the three glowing orange copper gold orbs. when i first saw this i realized it was not normal and was excited about getting a picture.","distance":"101-500

time ) i couldn't make out what was being said but it scared the crap out of me. my brother was in the next swim so i went to see if he knew what it was but i couldn't move for the life of me it was like i was frozen to my  bed chair i couldn't shout or anything. i've never felt like this ever before or after. it was like time had flashed by as the next thing i remember it was 6am and was just getting light. now i have started to have dream like flash backs and see things i cannot explain the main vision is of a 3 fingered hand pointy finger like a lizard claw but the strange part is what would be the palm of the hand is an opening with tiny wiggley things going all the way around it !!! and more resently i've started seeing an eye it's jet black teardrop shaped and like a greeny brown skin tone. i don't know if this is linked but me and my mrs were trying for another baby since 05 without joy then my partner fell pregnant within two weeks of this happening and my babe was born with a rare genetic disorder ( only 80 case in u.K. ) i don't know if it's anything to do with this or not intact i don't even know if anything really happened to me. but it is playing in my head i don't

the evening of 21 august, 2016, i observed a number of unidentified flying objects.  in total – four of them appearing as two pairs.  the time was about 2100 lst.  \r\nat first two appeared in the northern sky (bearing about 30 deg) and moved to the south, appearing to be over norris lake.  there was some cloud cover to the east, and the objects moved under the cloud.  one of the pair moved to a very low altitude and moved slowly  to the east where it was finally obscured by the trees surrounding my point of observation (bearing about 90 deg).  the second of this first pair moved consistently to the south, eventually disappearing into the distant southern sky being obscured by my house (bearing about 135 deg).\r\nthe objects were identical.  they were a collection of white lights surrounding a red light at what appeared to be the center.  the white lights appeared to move quickly and intermittently – jerking; not as one would expect from a solid object moving on a path with uniform momentum.  i do not think the central red light jerked.  it is possible that the apparent motion of the white lights could have been due to rotation.  my eyes were not good enough to be certain that rotation was involved.\r\nafter these two disappeared from the field of view, another identical pair appeared from the north, again bearing 30 deg. these two dawdled across the northern sky.  one appeared to describe a large circle before exiting near where it came from.  the other moved to the south-east and then curved to the horizon, bearing about 90 deg.\r\nthe red lights were all centered in the array of white lights.  at times, the outline of the structure appeared, but this was quite indistinct.  the vehicles were certainly not regulation aircraft.  the red light was a centerpiece, not a demarcation of a wingtip or some other aircraft feature.  rather than run for a camera, i stayed still so as to memorize what i was seeing.\r\nthere was no sound associated with any of the objects.  the possibility that they were in some way like helicopters seems rather unlikely.  at one stage, one of the objects appeared to descend very rapidly, but all such impressions remain simply impressions.  the overall width of the objects appeared to subtend an angle of about 10% of the moon (which was not present on the night in question).\r\n \r\n","distance":"Over One

window, i had just started my cigarette when i saw 10 to 15 orangish, oval shaped objects in the sky, they were moving very fast,travelling in a wide arc but the objects themselves kept perfect formation, it only lasted about 5 seconds and they were gone out of view. it was a clear cloudless night, im not entirely sure of the exact time but it would have been after 11pm on the 26th december. as soon as i seen the objects i called to my husband to come look but they were gone by the time he came to the room. i felt a bit frightened after seeing this, i have never seen anything like this before. i know what it wasnt, it was not a plane or fireworks or chinese lanterns or anything i have seen in the sky before.I have no idea what it is i saw.","distance":"Over One
