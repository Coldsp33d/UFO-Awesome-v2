after parking in our driveway, my daughters and i immediately saw this light or orb slowly moving across the sky from the east and heading west with a slight flickering. my first thought was it was a lantern, but it was moving to fast and consistent to be a lantern. my seven year old lost interest but my 10 year old and i continued to watch this object moving slowly across the sky without making any sound. once in the western sky the object completely vanished. the western sky wasn't completely dark yet, and this object seem to disappear from a bright light to nothing at all. i was able to take a picture of this object or light with my phone when it was over our heads. after disappearing we went into the house to tell my wife about it. her reply was it was probably a lantern. my 10 year old and i continued to watch the sky for the next 15 minutes to a half an hour before seeing another light moving across the sky from the east. my daughter immediately told my wife and she came out to witness it for herself. the four of us watched this light slowly moving across the sky heading west and then changing direction to the northwestern sky. instead of vanishing like the first on did, the second one just kind of faded into the sky. \r\n  this is the first time ever witnessing anything like this, and honestly it made me feel a bit frightened after seeing them.","distance":"101-500

looked in the southwestern sky and noticed an odd shaped reddish orange light above a ridge close by i pointed it out to my husband and he said oh it's just the moon covered by clouds. i showed him the moon was very visible in on the opposite side in the northeastern sky. the light started out as a long shape similar to a comet but it was not moving just hovering there above the tree line. it was partly cloudy and you could see the clouds and sky below the object illuminated like the object was shining a light down from it. there is normally frequent air traffic in this area of the sky and i found it strange i was seeing no airplane activity. the light began to fade and seemed as if the object turned but i could still see a trail coming from it although it really hadn't changed position in the sky it seemed stationary other than the dimming of the light. we observed this for about ten minutes and it was just a hovering orb shaped light that seemed to get dim and then brighter still with the area below very illuminated. then we began to see a lot of air traffic and we watched the orb just disappear. there were several airplanes but we noticed two in particular that continued to circle this area where the orb had been. they may have been helicopters not sure bc of the distance and cloud cover. we watched two airplanes or helicopters circle this area and descend lower in the sky directly over the ridge where we had just seen the strange orb light. then all of a sudden the air and field around us began to get very foggy and the sky very cloudy to the point we could no longer see anything in the sky so we went inside and began to discuss how we just saw a ufo.

shore listening to music with ear buds on my iphone. sky was relatively clear and numerous stars visible. at 11:45pm i saw a round orange glowing light emerge into view about 60-70 degrees above the horizon after passing the tree line along the shore. when it came into view it was only about 15 degrees from vertical to the west. it travelled in fairly straight path from west to east and same elevation with fluid motion. first reaction was wow, what the hell is that. i've seen planes and shooting stars over the lake but nothing like this. in about 5-7 seconds it travelled out of site to the east but just before it did, another appeared, identical to the first, at the same location just east avove the tree line and travelled in the same direction and path, west to east. again as it started to disappear out of view to the west a third orange light appeared again the same location and travelling in similar path and speed. again as it moved west a fourth light appeared in view in same location above the tree line and moved to the west. this light was still visible to the west when the 5th light appeared, again same starting view point for me when it passed over the tree line just east. after being amazed about what i was witnessing i realized they were not making any sound (i removed my ear buds when i saw the second light). i turned the camera on my phone and snapped 3 photos. i switched to video as the 5th light moved away to the west althgough this one seemed to adjust speed slightly up and down. then the 6th light appeared again from above the tree line and started moving west as the others did but this one stopped. it hovered in the sky moving slightly up and down and east and west. it seemed to know i was recording and was watching me. this freaked me out but i kept recording until it moved out of site to the west. this was the last light i saw. i realized later the flash on my phone rendered the photos useless as there was just a white haze in the photo. the flash was on the whole time during video but even with the white haze you can still see the lights moving in the background although you can see the orange glow as it actually appeared.There are also a few moths flying through the video shot in the light of the cameras flash but they're obvious.The lights were not all exactly evenly spaced but with nothing for a reference it's difficult to tell how big they were and the space between them. to recap, 6 lights with an orange glow moving in a very fluid motion horizontally across the sky with the last one stopping and hovering up & down and east & west before heading west and disappearing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the window i saw all these small beings about 3 foot tall glowing childlike little beings. they seemed very happy and i felt very safe and not scared at all. my boyfriend was asleep in the bed next to me and never woke up. a little beings came from a light that came straight down into my backyard. my dogs there they never barked and kept by my side. i got up out of bed to go see what was going on. i went to the sliding glass door in the next room as i got to the door the little beings were there to greet me.  i was still not scared at all i walked out the door but my two dogs stay inside which is not like them. they bark at everything but they were very quiet and stayed inside. the beings were playing around me and it was like they where and having fun getting me laughing. they felt very happy pulled me toward the light. they pulled me to the tunnel of the light and i went up into the light and i don't remember anything beyond that. i believe this happened for three nights in a row and on the third night i was awakened by a tall bald man wearing strange white and silver clothing he looked just like the statue of a man found at\r\ngöbekli tepe. he had come to get me again and this time i was tired and did not want to be woken up i did not want to go with him and i grabbed a pillow off the bed and threw it at him and said i don't want to go anymore and that was the last i ever seen of them. i drew a picture of him in a journal as i have told the story to other people. when i was watching the tv show ancient aliens i saw the statue of the man and realized that was him which made me decide to tell you about this. i also had a small incision on my right ankle on the inside in the shape of a triangle after this happened. he was bald and had very high cheekbones. you

and the object was right in front of us just hovering over mike's back yard. it caused so much excitement with us that his mother and sister came out of the house and saw it, those days not many had air conditioned homes we would open all the windows so all his neighbours heard all the yelling and excitement the next i know there were at least two dozen people all out in the street looking at this ufo in amazement. the ufo that would be described as a flying saucer was  over mike's back yard at about 60 feet the same height as the top of a telephone pole hovering for about 10 minutes,i was yelling mike get a camera so he ran in the house and came back out with a camera with no film in it, i then said call the police so his mother went in the house and called the police and when she told them there was a flying saucer over her house they said that it was probably a collage prank and they didn't even come over to check it out and take a report of over two dozen witnesses. i don't know if any of the other witnesses got a picture. i will give a full description of what i saw and the flight it took. when i first saw the ufo it was already there, after about 10 minutes we observed it just hovering and slowly spinning it slowly started to move do west toward new york city gradually going faster in a lateral path i tracked it to where i could only see a speck the size of a \".\" a pencil point in the sky when all at once it came back in 3 seconds, i never saw anything move that faster, no sound at all was coming from this object. when it came back to the exact same spot all the people were panic stricken and ran screaming into there houses, the three of us remained frozen in place amazed and all of a sudden the ufo started to wobble and then it flipped over like flipping a pan cake  and started to move away from us slowly taking the same path toward new york city do west until it was gone. this was a silver saucer that was the same on top as it was on bottom with a black band that look like tinted glass going around the middle.
