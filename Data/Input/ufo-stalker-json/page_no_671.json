where between south korea and the aleusian islands flying at about 35,000 feet about 30% into my flight.  looking out the window looking northward at what i thought was another aircraft northwest of us it appeared to be moving faster than the plane i was in.  suddenly, there were three then six glowing objects appearing to fly in formation.  then some of the objects would go in different directions both up, down, forward and reverse.  very strange,  i pulled out my cell phone and tried to do a video and the cell phone kept quitting.  i did manage to get one real short one attached.  there were 11 objects in total.  they would come and go and even disappear then come back again.   i switched to camera and then got nothing as they all disappeared.  i watched for a little while longer and then saw them again, only this time there were 5.  then my phone went dead.  they were farther away but brighter and then vanished.  they were gone for good.  i have been showing them around and someone suggested i send them to you.  i did not tell anyone nor did i hear any talk of this during or after my flight.\r\nalso strange but even when they flew information there was always two objects outside the formation moving around, almost like heading.  \r\nthank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is not the first incident i have had, as many years ago i had a very different experience and i sent in a report dating back to 1970 which was investigated by the air force.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

it couldn't have been longer then a minute or two of us just staring at this thing. we were so terrified we didn't dare even make a sound or take a breath. then suddenly this very loud pitch beeping sound came into my ears ... like a dog whistle if i was to try and compare the sound to something familiar. i was the first one to start running as fast as i could into the house. the sound it gave off really made me wake up to what it was that was actually going on. i was terrified and ran. my sister and friend stayed out there and watched it shoot off very fast into the night. again she said the thing didn't even make a sound when it took off. honestly.... i don't really remember much after that except we called our parents in a frenzy and they did not believe us. glad to say that they do now&#128512;. anyways.... thank you for reading my story and actually giving me a place to be able to share it. this sighting so long ago has really changed my life and the person i probably would not be today had i not experienced something so traumatic as that. i'll never forget it and am just very great up i was not alone that night. i do not think i would have even believed it myself had i not had my sister and friend there to tell me they seen it too!

saw it was 11:17pm. my brother came in and turned on a light in the next room that reflected off my window. staring at the window i saw a flash of light toward the east in the direction of the sangre de cristo mountains. at this point my brother had gone outside to retrieve something he left in his truck. the light is still on in the next room when my brother returns and dims the light. my bed faces my bedroom window and with less light reflecting off its surface, i noticed a glowing distortion in the sky that appeared to be wavering in place. i thought i was seeing the after effects of my eyes adjusting to the dark after seeing the light in the next room.\r\n\r\ncurious. i continued to stare out the window from my bed and noted the same wavering light(s). i glanced right, staring at the wall to see if my vision was responsible for seeing the light in the sky. seeing nothing i stared out the window and saw that the lights really were wavering in the sky, appearing to be relatively stationary with the exception of the wavering behavior that made the light(s) look as if they weren't quite staying in one place, but given the distance (i would say several miles) it may be that they were rapidly moving closely about each  other. i thought i was seeing a satillite but the light(s) wavering in place did not reflect a defined path across the sky.  meanwhile periodic flashes could be seen  (as you see with lightening in the night sky) to the east. \r\n\r\nmy brother confirmed that he ale could  see the lights and their odd behavior and noted the flashes of light when he was outside but didn't see any lightning bolts in that direction. i i is difficult to determine how distant the lights were. i cannot say they were of any particular shape, but appeared to be wavering stars flickering and giving the appearance of moving about each other in a set place in the sky. the flash of light to the east would appear now and then but ceased minutes later as we continued to stare at the lights.\r\n\r\ni do admit feeling some fear and trepidation once i realized there might not be a mundane explanation for the flickering and slightly moving starlike object(s). my brother and i watched the lights for nearly 40 minutes. in this time frame the light(s) slowly gained altitude and would slowly descend ever so slightly, wavering and flickering in the sky. the light(s) were brighter than the stars in the night sky, the given appearance of s group of lights wavering about each other excludes venus as a possible explanation.\r\n\r\ndespite feeling afraid and constantly noting the time, my brother and i looked away from the window for a moment and looked back at the sky. the lights were gone. it was 12:05 august 17th. during the sighting the lights were too far away to capture on film and this narrative will have to do.\r\n\r\nnow it's nearly 1am. it's likely my brother and i will remain awake for the better part of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1

a walk. she, of a very scientific mind, noticed a bright white light in the cloudless northern sky. the light seemed to be much lower than the altitude airliners fly, or even small planes. i thought maybe it was a head light of a big plane because it was so bright and big, but it stayed consistently bright as it traveled from the northern sky to the eastern/southern-ish. there were no wing lights, red or blue, of normal planes. i heard no engine noise, but couldn't tell if that was normal or not since it's height and size were unusual. i was curious about it's slow speed, thought it possible to be a helicopter, but heard no \"chopper\" sounds as i would expect. it seems like it took about two minutes to cross the sky, ever as bright as we first saw it, when it was east of us, standing beneath the cloudless sky, the white light slowly, slowly faded to black revealing one much smaller constant red light that seemed to have perhaps been on the whole time, but again, no flashing, no lights of any other color, and this red light after only say ten seconds, faded to black which only took two or three seconds. this seemed very inordinate, to go dark in the sky. it's not just that this is a safety hazard, but where the craft was when it 'disappeared' was not in place with where it should have been if the red light had just faded out of view from traveling away from us. \r\nto me it felt man-made and controlled, but whatever, it was not flying properly identifiable as far as we, untrained civilians are able to say.

few pictures with my samsung s6 phone of the beach, boardwalk, etc. i was waiting for sunset before dining. \r\n\r\nat sunset i noticed an object in the sky above the pier area that glinted a bit seemed mostly \"dull\" and seemed to be \"embedded\" in the clouds. at first i thought it was a bird perhaps or a plane. but it didn't move for nearly a minute while i observed it. i didn't give it much thought. i wasn't thinking about ufos or birds or planes. i was just taking pictures. i was thinking about dinner. i snapped a few pictures. a minute or so later i looked back up in the same area

i zoomed in on it and i can't explain what it could be. the object, which had seemed stationary in the sky at sunset and then had just vanished within a minute's time appears to be a rectangular
