1:30am on the 15th and described the object.  he dismissed it as a ufo due to it having lights, he stated if it was a ufo, they would not draw attention to themselves by having colored lights.  he also stated that ufo's would not be so close to a major airport (a mile or less away).  my fiend observed everything i saw and jokingly ran out to the street, jumped up and down, waived his arms yelling \"me...Me..Me\" but we never spoke about the event after that night.  being 12 years old, we did not feel afraid for some reason.  some years later, i seen the militaries new stealth jet and recall it looked similar to what we had seen, however, the object we seen was completely silent(at least from our distance), living that close to a busy airport, we would see and hear commercial jets countless times a day and from that distance the sound of a jet would be extremely loud and we would have felt the vibration as well.  also, the craft was much lower that a jet or plane would be and was moving very slowly (maybe 10mph) and appeared to hoover in mid air on a few occasions.

stroll,when i heard a commercial airliner throttle up,as it gained height above me,on the street where i live. i live not far from doncaster robin hood international airport,so i'm quite used to the

first i took to be the iss,which i'm also familiar with,but it then began changing direction to fly almost alongside the aircraft,but to the rear of it. at this point the aircraft seemed like it was deliberately trying to outpace the object. this was when i knew it wasn't the iss or a star,simply because stars don't move about in the night sky,to my knowledge,& the iss doesn't change direction,as it moves across the sky,as far as i know.\r\nwhat happened next is still stunning to me,even though i've seen another ufo do the same thing at around 2:30am,on 27th may!!\r\nthe ufo flashed very intensely 4 or 5 times intermittently,in the aircraft's general direction,then it simply veered into some light cloud,at a leisurely pace,& disappeared,as the aircraft continued on into the distant

afterwards,contemplating what i'd just witnessed,it dawned on me that this particular ufo was so close to that aircraft,that at least one of the flight crew must have noticed it at some point. even some of the passengers must have seen the intensely bright flashes it made.\r\nit was this,& other sightings i've had in my life,that made me want to report it for once. i tried to report a sighting i had years ago,but nothing came of it. surely someone on board that aircraft saw something that corroborates my sighting,because i know what i saw & it wasn't a hallucination,it really happened,above
