(we are 5 miles from the canadian border) it was huge.  a large blinking light in the front, 3 bright steady lights in back as it passed over.  i tried to awaken the oldest 11 year old but could not. the object almost seemed to float and was so low that it was hard to grasp how huge it was. it just disappeared over the trees of my neighbors.\r\n\r\nit was in the morning that i started sketching what it looked like.  i realized that for something that big and that low, it should have made a horrific sound.  no sound. i knew then, it was something i had never seen.\r\n\r\nthe next night, i was sketching the object on a napkin for my sister when the waitress walked by and said she had seen the same object, but years ago. she said \"i seen that same object while driving home.  my friend and i pulled over and about 6 other cars going in the opposite direction pulled over and they all watched it\" that gave me the validation that i seen something remarkable.\r\n\r\nshe said she watched the

( the ones i usually see in the sky spining/wavering around up high in the sky)\r\nso i figure it makes sense that the light going around in the bottom is the ships main source of power. \r\ni had seen so many way up in the sky and other occurrences in my life that i was so happy and amazed with what i had just seen.\r\ni'm fainted by them have been always it's become a fixation in a way.\r\ni'm sure there's good and bad like there is in everything but i didn't feel afraid just amazed and happy it had came so close that i finally know what i had been really seeing.\r\n\r\nit flew silently over the jeep and over my mom's roof very slowly huvering like and glided up into the sky over the trees and i couldn't see it anymore.\r\n\r\ni haven't seen any since that day, but like i said it was an eye opening experience and very knowledgeable experience.\r\n\r\nme and my boyfriend will remember it always it was his first believable experience now he believes like me.\r\n\r\nthe following day i found a weird black smooth looks like a rock i still have it i kept it. i found it on the table outside. kind of a momentum for the event and i think it may have dropped off the ship\r\nit almost seems platic but it's defiantly not.\r\nstill not sure but i felt to keep it. like i knew it was special.\r\n\r\ni have one other experience at my mother's years before i was a teenager when this had happened and a friend of mine had been there. i woke her up to make her watch and see what i was seeing she was sceptical until she seen it with me we watched it dance around over the lake for hours. it was a bright orange light it was way off in the distance when it was done i actually believe i seen it exit our atmosphere it darted off quickly strait (again like a space craft in the movies is depicted when they start up and travel at the speed of light...Sometimes i think the the movies aren't too far off on the way the present things at times) and when it exited a big  strait flash of light streamed across the horizon. and boom i even seen it grow increasingly smaller as it left earth. \r\n\r\nthis was the other most amazing experience happened at least 8-10

suddenly blurts out, \"hey speaking of ufos, what the hell is that in the sky\"  referring to something outside the window behind our tv.  i stayed on the couch while he went to our porch to get a better look.   he yelled out for me to come see what he was looking at but i ignored him for a few minutes thinking he was seeing a plane or helicopter.   finally i got up to look when he said he was going outside.   first i looked through the porch window and saw the orange orb.  i thought, that must be a helicopter but then i realized it was like a fireball and looked to be pulsating so i went ouside to see better too.   we were both standing in our backyard, rural area so not much light pollution, trying to understand the light.   i noticed that it got bright then dull then bright and going slower than an meteor or comet with no tail, didnt have the standard blinking multi coloured lights of an airplane so suggested helicopter.  my boyfriend observed there would be noise at the distance it was and it was silent.   suddenly it took a sharp turn left towards quebec so westerly  and faded out.  we stood there for a minute looking at the sky, i noticed the cloud over where the orb came from was strobing white light.  none of the other clouds were doing this and it was faster than a searchlight or airport light would be.  we started to head inside again when another orb appeared.  same color same pulsating orange glow same flight path.  we went back to our garden to watch.  this one never turned but seemed to stop and hover at a point that seemed to line up over out neighbours house then slowly continued on again before fading out and disappearing.  about 5 minutes later a third one appeared and followed the same pattern as the second one.  fading out once it hit a certain point on the horizon.  we waiting outside still but never saw a fourth but did notice that the strobing cloud was still strobing but in a different location. neither of us felt scared or upset by this just intrigued and curious.  it didn't seem as threatening and the strobing clouds did. unfortunately i never took any pictures or video, i did think about it at one point but didn't think the pics or video would turn out. going to be looking again tonight just incase.

stopping directly above us. as i looked up i started noticing my feelings, my breathing and everyone elses as well. i felt fear and i couldn't breayh on my own. it was as though we were all breathing in sync with this horrifyingly beautiful object. i'm not fully sure how long this lasted but when it stopped it was as though we could breath on our own again. because i had the seat nearest the window,  i put my head out of the window. thinking about it then and all these years later i don't know what posessed me to do it. but when i did i was face to face it seemed with the inside of the craft. it was shaped like a small plane with hooked wings ( i've drawn it hundreds of times through my life) it had a glass or see through bottom. my eyes were focused on the buttons, lights and technology. it was like a cockpit of a plane but a thousand times brighter and countless buttons and lights.. as time went by i tryed to explain to my mom how it felt like it took pictures of my eyes because i heard and saw the lights change and heard clicking noises. i have no idea where it went or how..I do know it was gone just like that. the car started and within seconds all four of us kid's were crying and balling hysterically. as my mom drove the car around the lake towards the restaurant i remember looking out the window afraid that it was following.  when we got to the  restaurant my mom had the task of explaining to everyone inside why she had four young people in hysterics on her hands. years passed and i watched a movie i think it was \"close encounters of the third kind\"

imagine the engines would be. it slowly drifted out of site behind a building but hovering above it was a huge disk shaped craft with flashing lights on the dome area. it had to be at least 300-500

i never saw before.I always liked building model planes but never had seen any thing of this nature before. i was intrigued by its size which spanned w.Liberty ave, approximately 5-6 lanes wide and beyond each side of the highway. i watched this object hovering in place for about 15-20 minutes, never making a sound of any type.When i had taken the trash out to the back yard & as i turned around to return to my house, that is when i noticed the craft hovering very close to the highway. after watching for that amount of time, i ran into the house to get my dad to look at it also, but when we both got outside, it had disappeared.As years went on i realized what i had seen from other events i read about.I am now 75yrs old. at 12 years old,i did not read news papers, except for the comic section, so i am not sure if that incident made \"the pittsburgh press\" news paper. i certainly was amazed at the size, i knew this was not a blimp, i know/knew what they looked like!The time of day was dusk, just enough daylight to clearly make out the shape & coloring, still, to this day i am amazed as to what i saw. however,november, 1950, a major snow storm hit our area & shut down a big part of pittsburgh with over 3feet of snow. the evening i saw the craft, it was fairely warm, as i was not wearing a jacket.I moved from the area to a city about 35mi north called new kensington, where i also witnessed what was believed to be ufo's,several, do not remember how many, witnessed by thousands that day, in the 1970's doing what seemed to an aeriel show just shooting up-down in different directions at break neck speed. they looked more like white orbs, that late afternoon. the newspaper that ran the story was \"the daily dispatch\" or \"the valley news\". the paper had changed its name from the former to the later but not sure when. i do not have more detail on the 1970's incident, as my family saw this happen while on the way to a friends home to visit & as we told the story to our friends,they mentioned numerous airplanes flying in that direction.

tried to say something, but it were as if my tongue would not work. the object made no noise of its own. i could only see and hear the water dripping back into the sea. i am not sure why i was sitting

slightly to my right, i noticed a plane-like pair of red/blue alternately blinking lights to the north in the direction of lake erie, where a thunderstorm was visible over the lake. cleveland hopkins airport is not too far to the east from here, so i am used to seeing planes each night, but this was clearly not a plane. these lights dropped down and then flew up to about 40 degrees or so and stopped, hovering. i watched for several minutes and then decided that this was odd enough to call my wife, who was inside our house about half a block away. she joined me at the corner and observed the rest of the event with me. at one point the red light appeared to switch off; now there was just a bluish-green light flashing. the object began moving again, first down and then to the left. then it moved up and started to grow fainter, as if it were flying out over the lake. the light disappeared; we assumed it had flown into one of the storm clouds over the lake. it reappeared briefly, flashing red and blue as it had at the beginning; it flew back into the cloud and was gone from sight for 10 seconds or so. suddenly it reappeared off to the right, and the blue light shut off and the red light began blinking rapidly. finally, the object dropped straight down below the tree line and disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nas a mufon member, i am always scanning the night sky, and i have seen many planes and, occasionally, satellites. i have never seen anything like this. i can't discount the possibility that the lights were attached to a drone, but if so, it was moving erratically, hovering for long periods of time, and displaying a changing light pattern near a strong thunderstorm. lightning did flash behind the object multiple times during the sighting, but i couldn't see any shape silhouetted against the bright light.\r\n\r\ni was not scared by the encounter, and the possibility that it might be a helicopter (i don't think so) or drone kept me from getting too excited, but i honestly don't know what this was. my wife was somewhat concerned because her first reaction was that this might be a plane or aircraft in distress. the dogs did not react in any way (aside from one yipping when the lights made a sudden maneuver and i stepped on his foot!)","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with
