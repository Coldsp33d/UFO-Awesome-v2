mountain location. we do this a lot and we are familiar with the view and evening sky.  spouse commented, \"look! what is that?\" i followed his gaze and saw among the very sparse non-cumulous clouds a double line of very bright and very large yellow-metallic-white lights.  not blinking and not moving.  the sun was down, but stars had not yet appeared, and these lights were approximately 2x or 3x larger and brighter than any stars, anyway.  i could not turn my head away because i have never seen anything like this and was completely mystified.  then after only a few seconds, they just disappeared.  without moving, but seemingly \"behind\" the small thin cloud that was above them.  we actually expected that the lights would become visible again as the cloud moved or disipated, but they were just gone.  we were pretty freaked out, and a few minutes later we heard a rumbling like thunder seeming to come from south of the lights' location, but there were no storms or storm clouds nearby.  as we continued to stare at the sky looking for something that would help us understand what we saw, my spouse said he thought the sky looked like there was a line in it.  i didn't understand, but then a jet appeared with a trail behind it, but there was no line in the sky from the area it came from.  it was like it just came into view in the middle of the sky, from \"nowhere\".  there is commercial and other air traffic visible from our lookout, but this jet was moving much faster than a regular commercial plane - feels wierd to suggest this, but it seems like it was a

united states navy in ww2 and was deployed on the uss anchor ars13 in 1946 as quarter master third class. my father filled out and file a complete and specific report in the ships log about this incident. here is my fathers recollection as if he were speaking...\r\n\r\napproximately the end of may or first part of june 1946, i was on watch on the uss anchor ars13 from 16:00 to 24:00. we were in route from guam to pearl harbor hawaii. approximately half way through my watch i saw a bluish/greenish streak traveling at a tremendous speed on the port side above the horizon. the streak was about 30 degrees above the horizon, traveling from north east to north west. the streak had no arch, it was straight as an arrow. at first i thought it was a ship in distress, but i ruled that out because flares are red and they have an arch and the same as for meteorites, they have an arch also. this streak was parallel to the horizon and no arch. i immediately reported it to the captain. the captain came right away with the first lieutenant. when the captain arrived he ordered to check the radar. the radar showed a blip circling the ship about a mile out and it would circle the ship about every 10 seconds. we were all astonished at the speed this thing was going. the captain then ordered a sailor to go onto the mast to check the radar to see if a bird or something else was obstructing the radar. all was clear. after this had been going on for about 10 minutes, all of the sudden the blip changed direction and just streaked off the screen. my whole report was filed in the ships log on the uss anchor ars13, approximately may or june of 1946. total witnesses that were there... myself, captain, first lieutenant, executive officer, engineering officer, radio man and radar man. no recurrence of this incident.\r\n\r\nmy father said back in 1946, nobody would ever think of this being a ufo sighting, since there was no ufo sighting back in those days. the first ufo publicly reported was june 24, 1947 by kenneth arnold a private pilot.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

montgomery, alabama to fort rucker, alabama. the time was approximately 6:00 pm. the pilot radioed the tower to let them know we were entering the airport airspace. the tower could not locate us so they asked us to turn on our landing lights. the tower then acknowledge seeing us and gave us the wind and barometric pressure. the ski was clear and there were few clouds visible. shortly there after a mist started to appear directly in front of our helicopter that thickened really quickly. to the point i thought we were in a thick fog. then i could make out what looked like a red flashing light (with no defined edges) directly in front of us. the effect reminded me of a car's tail light(one side only) with the flasher on that is located in a thick fog. you do not see the car- just the light).Almost instantly the red light become brighter and suddenly you could see a cylinder object pulsating red ever its surface coming directly at our windshield. the pilot immediately dove to the left and down thinking we where going to hit. my impression was that this red lighted cylinder object had flown directly through us as if we where not even there. the total time from the appearance of the fog or mist to the red object coming directly at us was approximately 10 to 20 seconds ( its hard to gage time when the event is occurring.) the pilot and copilot then said over the intercom to each other what the heck was that. all three of us had seen the object. the pilot called the tower and asked if we had any traffic in our area and they said that there was no traffic. the pilot and copilot both said that this was something that they had no idea what it was and they thought they where colliding with an unknown flying object (ufo). if it was the top of a radio tower, i saw no tower, no support wires etc. the object made no attempt to avoid our helicopter. the reason i am reporting this now is i am getting up there in years and want to let others know my experience.

utah. it was over me. i was watching it and kind of keeping my eyes on the sky because of the increased military aircraft lately. and i'm watching it wondering if it was a helicopter or airplane and it went straight over head and i saw its triangular and it's got lights on every edge. and what surprised me because i've heard a lot about these is that i've always assumed that the point of the triangle pointed forwards. there was a flat edge pointed forward as it moved over me. and it had lights all along every edge. it was only about 500 feet high probably only 15 to 20 feet long on each one of the edges and on the tail it had a very bright light brighter than all the rest of them and the rest of them seemed like soft colored leds.\r\nc-interesting. probably so far i bet you didn't hear anything. so it flew the flat edge first?\r\nj-flat edge forward and pointed towards the back.\r\nc-i never seen that i've seen flying square that was amazing and it looked like it had four lights on in one square shaped and it was fun kind of bizarre. saw it in utah the wasatch mountains near the university of utah.\r\nj-they say the new area 51 is out near dugway.\r\nc-it is. the eagle range they have a huge runway 2 to 3 miles long no one knows why they have a runway that long. maybe they have something that needs a runway that much space to land but there are other things that they are testing like lasers. they are using to communicate with extraterrestrials. i've been out in that area in fact. i was there held at gunpoint when i stood in front of the gate. soldier showed up they were very nice to me and then said you better get out us here because if wackenhut shows up you're going to be a dead man. i better not be a dead man so i put all my stuff away because we had a camera. some guy from wackenhut saying if i don't leave the property i'm going to be shot. so they escorted me from tula county to salt lake county and then left me.\r\nj-i heard that they have restricted access enclosed a lot of the roads that used to travel on down there.\r\nc-they warned me not to be in that county again and i go to wendover. so i said yeah whatever but when they were very mean to me.Military was kind of in blazers pulled guns on us and followed us out of the county. during the day. had flashlights and everything my crew left the camera running but we knew wackenhut meant business. drones?.....Missing conversation\r\nj-but this triangle craft was so small. i heard them being the size of football fields 1520 feet long but it made me think that it's a drone because it's small and that makes it look less threatening. then i thought why haven't we seen a full size quadcopter like for an aerial crane. \r\nend at 3:08:50\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

was walking into my bedroom (looking north)(8/13/2015, 10:50pm cdt).  i saw an extremely bright white light outside my very large bedroom window.  i went to the window and saw the extremely bright white light illuminating my entire lawn, fence, and trees at the back of the house (large area).  the white light was so intense, i could make out every blade of grass.  it was brighter than daylight and it covered the whole backyard.   the white light was steady (very little movement) illuminating my grass for about 5 minutes.  i wanted to see where the bright white light was coming from, so i looked up and i saw a bright red steady light (also very little movement, inches).  it looked like there was some movement back and forth, but on the order of inches, very slight movement, which i could gauge by the shadow of my house on the grass moving slightly.  when i looked in the direction of the red light, i could not see the source of the white light projecting onto my lawn - there was absolutely no beam at all.  i noticed that the bright white light was only my grass, fence, and trees, but the sky was dark.  there was no sound at all during my observation.  during my observation, i could not make out any object around the red light - it was so dark.  the red light was very bright and the color was beautiful.  it was not a paprika red, but had a combination of red and purple, a stead color.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the white light projected onto my grass, i thought there must be a police helicopter with a bright search light trying to find somebody in my yard.  \r\n\r\nmy feeling was of fear because i thought someone was on the loose in my yard, and the police were searching for them.   i left the room to go get my husband to come see the scene.   the bright white light and red hovering light were gone when i got back to my bedroom (2 minutes later).  after the incident, i went to all my windows to see if i could find someone lurking (there was nobody).\r\n\r\n\r\nafter the incident, it occurred to me that the bright white light was not performing as a search light, moving back and forth, it was steady the whole time over a fixed area.  it also occurred to me that it was strange there was no sound at all, and that a helicopter or other air vehicle would have made sound especially being so low to the ground.\r\n\r\nother:  weather was
