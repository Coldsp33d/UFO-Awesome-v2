have been huge and moving fast.At the angle i was standing i could not see this for it was now out of my vision but my wife said ..It stopped over our house.By the time i got there it had flown

i always heard some thing no matter how high it was. i also didn't see any wings or tail and no blinking lights at all. the object flew on and went back to watching the sky. within about 5 minutes of the first sighting i saw another bright object same as the previous one this craft came out of the north west and proceed to come in on an angle towards me form n.W. to s.E then it abruptly changed to a southerly course, while the object was making the course change another craft  came from the north and it seemed to speed up to the other and as it  did it made a maneuver to get closer to the other object and then fly south in formation . now i knew it couldn't be commercial airliners they just don't do that kind of thing. so maybe they were military craft but they weren't rigid maneuvers like we see on tv or an airshow it was as if there were no rhyme or reason for the second aircraft in this set to catch up with the first. about 8 minutes later,now very curious about what i have seen, out of the nw west again,but more  north then west as the sun was just about set. i observed another aircraft moving towards me while another craft came out of the north and as before the first craft changed to a southerly course while the second craft sped up to join with other.I personally believe in extra terrestrial life that are actually living here among us. however i don't just believe what im told,i like to investigate and  analyze what im told then i make my best decision.  im writing this because i believe i saw something i cant explain and im hoping you can. i watch your show and what i see in your investigations are honest and trust worthy.Also between the second and third sighting i saw a black helicopter fly north i don't know if they are related sincerely [name

are planes, you can still see their wing shapes. this thing clearly had no wings and wasn't as thin as airplanes, it was more chunky-looking. it didn't sound like an airplane either, and since there was an actual plane that flew right after, i don't know if the hum sound was from the object itself or from the plane that was approaching the area right after, at lower altitude.  i don't know what the object was and i'm not saying it was a ufo, but it sure looked very different from any of the planes i've observed laying down on my yard many, many times. i don't think this object departed from

soon as i opened the front door i immediately noticed a bright orange light moving upwards from behind a black silhouette of pine trees  situated directly across the street from my house. i was amazed and thought \"how cute someone has a drone, and watched the bright orange image hover down the street. it was moving slowly so i opened the front door to call my 8 year old son to hurry up and see this drone. when my son went outside the first bright orange image was hovering down the street at a slow pace. then my son said look mom there is another one. the second bright image was the same exact color. and then i thought wow they own two drones? i was suspicious then. \r\nmy son began to wave at the second orange light. our front entrance-way has a solar operated light and while he was waving his arms trying to get attention from the orange bright light. the light slowed and then broke its  path from the first bright orange light. it started to hover towards us in a very slow fashion and it was getting smaller i watched the bright light it was now directly above us and i was very nervous now asking my son to please stop attracting attention to the bright light that was now hovering above us for about 10- 15 seconds. it then moved the opposite way it was flying south west more westerly. from the first bright orange light. and it was going higher because it was getting smaller. then all of the sudden the bright light was no more like as if a light with shut off. all of the  sudden at a much higher altitude we witnessed an airplane/ with it typical engine airplane sound with flickering lights flying northbound in the sky. i told my son to please go back into the house.\r\n i was petrified. in shock. i asked my son if he saw the bright lights. he confirmed this. i called the police dispatcher to see if anyone had called in reporting the orange lights.I told her i moved here last november and i also asked if she knew anything about drones being allowed to fly at certain altitudes. the dispatcher said no one called.\r\ni told her this was very strange explained what my son and myself witnessed. she asked me what my address is. then i immediately called my

towards each other as if on a collision course. they would fire some sort of weapon or discharge at each other as they circled each other. then shoot in straight line away from each other and repeat process. never going in same direction each time. after about 30 minutes of this a third object came from due north to their position.  at that time two of them would chase the other and would fire what i would describe as weapons at it. the weapon would strike the other ufo occasionally causing a bright white to reddish flash. after another 30 minutes of them doing battle one ufo looked as though it exploded causing what i would describe as a blast with all color spectrum's. at that time only two lights remained visible and circled each other for another 20 minutes and move around as if they was searching for something.  my wife arrived from work at 3:25 am. at that time i took her out and pointed the two moving objects to her. she could see the flashes when they would accelerate but due to her poor vision they were not visible to her in movement as they were to me as i have perfect vision with my glasses. when i first began witnessing the event i made sure it was not lens flare

do you see that bro? oh my god, what is that?”  as soon as he pointed in the direction i instantly saw what he was talking about.  it was moving quicker across the sky then any airplane could, but way slower than a meteor, it was also glowing bright like a star.  it flew directly over us in clear view for about 10 seconds, as it was making it’s way into the distance two meteors simultaneously fell from the sky straight at it.  it looked like a scene straight out of star wars.  we thought that was amazing, we debated for about twenty minutes about what it could have been.  every hair on my body was standing straight up, it was an amazing scene.  my buddy was all amped up about it, pacing around in circles, he finally sat back down and we both continued to look up.  about five minutes later it was either a second craft or the same one from earlier, i’m really not sure, but i do know it looked a lot like the first one. this craft traveled in the path of a half circle in the sky, kind of like a car making a u-turn.  this is when things get real.  both of us were starring at it as it changed speeds, finally it came to a hover and two smaller objects glowing a reddish orange color appeared over the tree line.  the two objects came up to the larger object on a 45 degree angle from the left and right sides.  all three objects hovered close together long enough for me to take out my iphone to try to capture a video.  the video was pitch black and riddled with profanity and rendered useless.  finally the object on the right moved closer to larger object and suddenly changed direction and shot off into space.  i’d estimate that five seconds later the object on the left did a mirror image of what the craft on the right did as it shot off into the distance.  finally the larger object circled around us again, it was definitely changing speeds as it cruised above us.  my buddy commented that it was trying to trick us into thinking it was a star.  it would move slowly and then stay stationary glowing bright.  at this point the sun was starting to come up and the stars were falling over the tree line.  we didn’t actually ever see the larger craft leave, it kind of moved slowly away from us and eventually disappeared.  it was truly a remarkable experience, one of those once in a lifetime type things.  when those two smaller objects appeared from behind the trees,  i was completely blown away.  it’s a strange situation to be in.  i know what i saw, but at the same time, i have no idea what was up in that sky last night.  i’m just glad that someone was there to witness it with me, otherwise i myself would think that i was crazy.  the whole event lasted about two hours from start to finish.  hopefully by posting this event i can bring justification to those people who witnessed it by themselves.  i’m actually disappointed that nothing online has been posted yet, i was pretty sure that others would have seen it because it was a night where more people were star gazing do to the meteor shower.  thanks for reading.  live long and prosper. i’m now a believer.

roughly 29 meteors. they were streaking and would stop and we knew exactly what they looked like. during our observation, we noticed a star-sized object moving across the sky from south to east. the rate of travel was unlike anything ive ever seen. from a point of view looking at the stars it could jump from one star to the next in seconds. it would pause, circle, reverse, zig zag and then shoot off. this sighting lasted about two and a haf minutes. another orb re-appeared more east soon after the first object took off, which we assumed was the same object we saw previously. this object was not covering as much area now as when we first saw it, but it was still zig zagging, dropping, and ascending but this time there was a faint beam coming off of it. not too much longer a second orb appeared farther to the left of the object we were observing. so now we are witnessing two ufo's at once zig zagging, descending, and ascending. it almost seemed as if they were watching the meteor shower. after observing these two objects for about 20 minutes, a smaller white/blue light ejected from the second craft and shot across at an incredible lightning speed and re-appeared next to the first craft in the air. both of the first two objects were still moving in no pattern when we left. we were not able to get pictures as our iphones could not pick up the light. we decided there was nothing else we could do and the meteor shower was over and we decided to go home. needless to say we were scared shitless but at the same time intrigued so we started waving to it. we knew it was far higher than any airplane could go and we knew it most likely couldnt see us but we gave it a shot.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
