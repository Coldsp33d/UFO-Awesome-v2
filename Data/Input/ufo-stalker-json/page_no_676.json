you have to understand something. i am an amateur astronomer, and weather observer. i have been scanning the sky for decades. i have seen a lot of remarkable things, but never anything like this. if there is a rational explanation for what i saw, believe me, i would love to hear it. my head may be in the clouds, but my feet are planted firmly on the ground. i am really curious to know if anyone else reported anything unusual in my area that night. \r\n\r\nthank you for taking my report.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":69329,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.616287852386485,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08132015-0037","longitude":-74.24322461488045,"occurred":1439438700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1439486238000,"summary":"Observed what i thought was a bright star, when suddenly it slowly winked out.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":28,"maxtempi":82,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":74,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":18,"mintempi":65,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":28,"maxtempi":82,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":74,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":18,"mintempi":65,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"07008","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Carteret, New Jersey","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13478"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Kingston","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\r\n1.\twhere were you and what were you doing at the time?\r\n\r\nsitting on my front porch at the address above enjoying the evening and chatting with my tenant over a cocktail. i was looking around at the property and the sky (i always keep my eyes on the skies)\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\n\r\ni was looking south at the sky past some trees and a power line and i spotted the object in the sky moving right to left just above one of my neighbour’s trees.\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n\r\ni thought it was a conventional aircraft\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\n\r\nobject spotted at approximately 19:45:30. at first glance i thought it was a conventional aircraft as it was flying straight and level at typical aircraft speed. what appeared to be a white very high aspect ratio arched wing was visible at the bottom, with two light greyish coloured fuzzy patches above which i took to be reflections off of twin high wing engines. no engine noise heard. i could not see a fuselage nor tail structure but did not think much of it immediately as it is common to see light planes and helicopters in the area.\r\n\r\nobject was moving approx west to east at maybe 1500 foot altitude at perhaps 115 knots (typical small aircraft speed, approx 1000 m due south of my house. visibility good, sky clear and a rain squall had moved east of the area about 1 hour before.\r\n\r\nclear sky light breeze from the north. weather records from kingston airport (ygk) show 7 km/hr from 320 deg at 2000 hrs that day.\r\n\r\ni jokingly said to my friend t sitting on the porch as well ‘hey, that might be a ufo’ and she leaped up and snapped a photo of it with her iphone (model 5s) and immediately emailed it to me. \r\n\r\n‘do you really think so?’ she asked and i said ‘i doubt it, perhaps it could possibly be a high winged twin engine flying boat of some kind. (ie engines mounted above the wing)’. \r\n\r\nbefore it disappeared to the east behind some trees, its path started to descend slightly in a smooth curve, which struck me as odd.\r\n\r\nit is interesting since we have been discussing the subject over previous days as i am an accredited mufon field investigator, a former mufon country representative for hong kong. \r\n\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n\r\nfeelings of mild curiosity, which increased substantially after i examined t’s photo the following day. \r\n\r\nat the time of teh sighting, i activated the flight tracker app on my samsung smart phone and determined there were three commercial flights at high altitude within about a 20 mile radius. unfortunately i did not record a screenshot.\r\n\r\nmy curiosity increased when i looked at the photo the following day. there was no sign of the white wing, nor any tail or fuselage. \r\n\r\ni therefore decided to investigate a bit. \r\n\r\ni contacted (unofficially) aviation sources who were also curious and kindly gave me flight  movement records of local flight movements in the area. \r\n\r\nthere were five flight movements recorded in the time frame:\r\n\r\n18:05 hrs cessna citation 750\r\n19:56 hours beech 1900 \r\n20:21 hours cessna 172\r\n20:36 hours cessna 172\r\n20:40 hours beech 1900\r\n\r\nmy source was not able to specify what the flight movements were – i understand they could be takeoffs, landings or transits of the local control zone. checking schedules the two movements of the beech 1900 were clearly the arrival of the scheduled toronto – kingston air georgian  flight and its subsequent departure back to toronto.  the two cessna 172 movements were likely a short training flight from the local flying club. the citation could be a landing, takeoff or (unlikely) a low level transit through the air control zone. it is outside the time frame as are the c 172’s.\r\n\r\ni considered whether the sighting could have been the inbound yyz - ygk air georgian flight and find that extremely unlikely. i have taken that flight many times myself and it invariably does a straight in approach to either runway 07-25 or a single turn approach onto final onto runway 01-19 (depending on the wind direction). \r\n\r\nsince the area of the sighting is 14 km east of the airport, even if they had been using runway 25 they would not have got that far east of the airport. as the wind was recorded at 320 degrees i expect they used runway 01,  turning straight in onto final from the yyz – ygk course of about 090.\r\n\r\ni will be following up to try to obtain official records and may consider contacting air georgian.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\n\r\nsee above. object was obscured by trees.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s), Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

front lawn, it seemed like you could see forever in any direction due to the home being built on the highest local point. at approximately 10pm, i was admiring the view and looking up at the stars. i remember thinking how clear the sky was, and how that must be related to having no street lights in the area. i saw what i first thought to be a shooting star, as it appeared to be coming from....I don't know...The cosmos??? but it had to have been way way out into the depths of the abyss. i can remember how quickly it went from the size of a star to more like a nickel or quarter. it traveled in a direction that was toward the home, as if it were a meteor that would strike us. i actually flinched due to the speed at which it traveled. just as i started to flinch, it stopped and hovered perfectly still for what seemed like an eternity. in reality, however, it hovered for probably 8-10 seconds. i watched this thing appear to rotate silently. as it rotated, it pulsed blue, red and green in sequence. i saw that sequence at least 2-3 times. bare in mind, i'm looking upward... it then traveled from my 2 o'clock view to about 8 or 9 o'clock view so fast that my eyes could not fallow. i can only say that i saw it pass in my field of vision. sure, i tried to track it with eye/head movement, but it's was faster than my eyes could move. it did not accelerate. it went from hovering to full speed, instantly. i began to shout at the other guests at this time and ask if anyone else had seen this, and only one other gentleman had. i don't know his name. he was slim, dark-haired and about 20 yrs old. within about 2 mins, 2 darkly lit fighter jets came over and were heading in that direction. they were low and fast. i could hear the engines screaming and i know they had those things wide open....Had to because it \"boomed\" when they came over. within the next 2-3 mins, i saw a total of 4 more jets, 2 large 4 engine planes (like a c-130 maybe?) and finally 2 helicopters. now it was dark, so i'll give you that....But these things did not look like the planes i normally see. these were all darkly painted. had to be gray or black. some appeared to have no

parking lot of my apartment complex, doing some stargazing in the early morning hours of september 23rd, 1991. it was around 1:27 am that morning. although there was no moon, the sky was clear, and the stars were brightly visible. i was observing a few stars to the north, as i began to focus my attention on one star in particular, it suddenly disappeared from my view. (it seemed like a light going out, when the switch is turned off). i was taken by surprise of course, then kinda jumped up feeling kind of bewildered, and at first thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, or maybe i lost focus of the star in particular. as my attention was turned to a couple more stars in the same area, i noticed again, that they seemed to just \"go out like light bulbs\", then i was really confused, but tried to strain my eyes, trying to see beyond the glare of the street light a few feet down, and across the street from me. as i watched, and searched for the cause of what happened to the stars, i then noticed a black, silhouette crossing the night sky. the dark figure, was crossing my path of vision, between the stars i had been looking at, and myself, of course, blocking the starlight from my view. i couldn't make out what i was looking at at first. the object moved slowly towards the south, and it wasn't until it turned right, towards the south west, that i could then make out its shape. it looked like a giant \"v\"-shaped craft. but not as narrow as a v, more like a spearhead, or arrowhead shape, with a notch cut-out at the rear base, between the two wing tips. it was huge! it was as large as a football stadium! it was black, no lights, no sounds, it seemed to just float across the sky, like a balloon, or blimp. not very fast at all, and i thought to myself, \"how could something that large fly so slow, and not fall out of the sky?\" i was, shocked, amazed, and a little afraid. it seemed to not want any attention brought on itself, as it had no lights or sound. as i said, it was a black silhouette, a shadow, but i just happened to see it by mere chance! i called out to neighbors, but no one came. i didn't want to run inside to call authorities, as this was something i didn't see everyday. so i just wanted to watch this thing in total amazement. since this experience, i've only told a few people, but after being laughed at, i stopped sharing my story, until now, and decided to make this report. i've researched many v shaped ufo stories, videos, and pictures online, but sadly, i haven't come across anything that resembles the one i had seen. i know what i saw, and after what i had seen, i know that craft wasn't man-made, nor that it was from this world. i want to know what is out there, and even if i don't like what i find, i'm compelled pursue and learn the truth. p.S. about a week after the sighting, i had a dream of the same craft, in my dream, it appeared to be hidden in clouds, and it exited the cloud mass, hovering over me...","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":69314,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.8891549,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08132015-0022","longitude":-97.9391741,"occurred":685589220000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1439468645000,"summary":"Large  triangular ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":27,"maxtempi":80,"maxvism":17,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":24,"meantempi":76,"meanvism":12,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":73,"minvism":3,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":27,"maxtempi":80,"maxvism":17,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":24,"meantempi":76,"meanvism":12,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":73,"minvism":3,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8725,"locationName":"San Marcos, Texas","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13493"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Magna","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was outside watching for the meteor shower, when i saw 4 lights in the sky near the horizon about a quarter up in the sky. they were in two pairs and the same distance apart. they did not move and were not stars. they were in the northeast sky. i got out my binoculars and could see that they were fluttering, wobbling and emitting different colors of light, blinking. the one on the very far right had a smaller red light that was close to it. i observed them for approximately 15 minutes and they did not move that whole time.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":69313,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.666530199512124,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08132015-0021","longitude":-112.06821368474293,"occurred":1439337600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Utah","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1439468095000,"summary":"Outside watching for meteor shower. saw  4 stationary lights in pairs same distance apart. they all flashed different colors. one had a red light beside it. all 4 too low to be stars..

attention to this light, i noticed that reddish, bluish, yellowish, greenish and white lights were pulsating from this object.  i then went back to the house to get my binoculars to try to get a

tell but remained in its same location at all times.\r\n\r\ni continued to watch this object which was about the same size as the visible stars in the area until about 1:30am when i went into the

as an orange blob. the overall size and speed of the object made me pay attention to it. in my opinion, no definitive shape or detail could be inferred simply from the speed the object was moving other than maybe an oval shape with obvious skewing in detail. i am not too familiar with the properties that would be associated with an object moving at such unreal speeds, but i wonder if maybe even the color could be different from the intense speed it was moving as well. i ended up stargazing with her after we got back home so that i could reassure myself that what i had seen was not a comet, but the funny thing was to me, the comets seemed to move slower than this object. not any grand difference of speeds probably because it was still viewable to my human eye, but seemingly faster, nonetheless. and there was extremely obvious differences. comets were small objects with tails at much greater distances away. the size of the object i viewed was enormous. i was not capable of viewing it for more than a few seconds, but it still imparted me with this feeling of awe that such a large object was able to move at such great speeds. if i were to give a very loose definition of length and width it honestly would not be that far off from the length and height of a vw beetle even though it seemed to be a great distance in the sky. i wish i could have viewed it longer to get a better idea of the size because i feel i really might have seen a \"mothership\" move at near warp speed or something along such parameters--once again, not an expert though. i was left honestly with a greater inner peace after viewing this because i had believed in ufo's and the existence of aliens before this, so it was just a nice confirmation for me. the only thing that could be scary for me as a logical thinker is that an object of such size could move at that speed. the object was not interested in me or anything in the area. i was just lucky enough to briefly view it.

(i looked it up later...A sun halo caused by ice crystals in the atmosphere, i think.)  \r\n\r\nwe grabbed our cameras hoping to take a picture of the circular rainbow.  of course, it was difficult and we laughed about shooting directly at the sun.  with squinty eyes i took a series of 11 shots over a two minute, 6 second period.  glancing at my camera screen (so bright out), it was hard to see if i could 'capture the full rainbow' so i took the shots hoping to catch the bottom of it, the top of it, and hopefully a shot of the full circle.  it was quite random.  my friend and i discussed it...Figuring the shots wouldn't even turn out thinking the sunlight would glare over the pictures.  (my camera:  sony dsc rx100.  aperture: f/8. lens:  sony 28-100mm f1.8-4.9. focal length 10.4mm. shutter speed:  1/1250-1600.  flash did not flare...Auto mode. auto white balance. landscape mode, auto exposure.)\r\n\r\nwhen we got back to the house, we pulled out our cameras...I noticed blue orbs on my pics and figured they were glares, camera lens dirt, reflections or whatever.  then, my friend said they were on his pictures as well.  initially, there was a bit of silence and disbelief--particularly because my pictures showed the orbs and 'blue light with a trail' in different locations between shots.  none of us saw anything when we took the pictures because, naturally, we couldn't look up directly at the sun.\r\n\r\nwhen i came back to tulsa, i loaded the pictures onto my macbook pro.  i am fascinated by the blue lights.  then, i decided to adjust the pics to see if anything would become clearer or more distinct.  i adjusted (increased) the following:  contrast, black point, definition, highlights, shadows, saturation, vibrancy.  essentially, just 'pushed them to the limit' to see if anything would show up more clearly. \r\n\r\nthat's when i became overwhelmed:  three distinct spots...One larger with a trail, one colored orb and another different colored orb.  in different locations between shots.  the contrail left by the jet that had flown by earlier gave us a reference point.  these photos just don't make any sense to me.  the 11 photos don't show any semblance of 'sequence' of movement...The orbs appear in different locations between the photos.  it's easy to determine the difference between the clouds present and the orbs. we can't figure out what they are.  just an anomaly?  something real?  light reflections?  sure would like to know more!\r\n\r\ni have the original digital photos protected in their original form on my computer as well.  the photos i'm sending in are the enhanced versions that clearly show several orbs in different locations.  the pictures are in sequence of when they were taken.  number 18 is omitted because it was taken 5 seconds after number 17 and showed the same phenomenon...And i see i can only attach 10 photos.  ironically, photo number 15 is the only one i got with the 'full circle halo' and oddly, it's the only one without any orbs showing up.  number 22 is the most distinct.  \r\n\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":69309,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.9827694,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08132015-0017","longitude":-74.0691028,"occurred":1439037960000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1439463253000,"summary":"Pictures of a sun halo reveal orbs.
