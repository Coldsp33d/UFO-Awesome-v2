light foundation at 7:30 p.M. my friend, judy was driving. we came to a red traffic light on lincoln and harbor in anaheim. i looked up and saw thousands of these black \"shadow\" disc shapes in the sky. they were everywhere. my first comment to judy was, \"what the h*** is that? she said, \"i don't know.\" the light changed to green and we drove on to our destination. i could still see these black oval shapes. some were quite large. the remainder were of various sizes. don't know if, the size was determined by distance from them to me or not. the sky was full of these objects. i heard no sound. no lights. no metal configurations. they were very similar to \"shadows\" in the sky. my sense was this wasn't a good thing. strangely, judy and i never talked about it, again. we didn't mention the experience to those at the meeting. just kind of ignored the whole experience. how could there have been so many objects in the sky and no one else seemed to notice them? i would estimate over 1,000 objects. as of today, i've never heard of such a sighting. would be interested in knowing if, others have had this same experience and their thoughts on what all those black spots were doing in the sky?\r\n\r\nin early 1950, i was presented with the sight of a burnished gold ufo flying over my house. it was silent. i ran outside (i was a teenage at the time) these black objects were nothing like what i had seen years before. the memory has stayed with me all these years and i didn't know what to do with the information. and, who would believe me....I wasn't a teenager at this last sighting. as far as this sighting is concerned, that is all i can recall. it had pretty much only lasted during the red light and as we drove on down the street. the sun was getting into our eyes and driving was difficult because of it. oddly, i don't recall any other traffic in the area.....\r\n\r\ni've had other experiences but, this one is the one that stays with me. why didn't the jets from el toro marine base take pursuit or at least, investigate???? \r\n\r\ni appreciate your time in reading about my sighting. maybe, someone out there has answers for me.

was outside my parents place at 12:20 recording myself because i was seeing weird stuff in the sky and everything went quiet for a moment, and just not your normal quietness, anyways i saw a orb in the sky flying all directions until it took off towards the north and vanished. then another showed up to the ne and was bobbing up and down like a yo-yo and vanished quite quickly. suddenly no more than 5min after another craft showed up above the trees in front of me no more than 100-150ft from me with red and green lights pulsating around the object and all of a sudden the lights went out and it started to glow red in the center a bit and it just kept getting more red and as it was turning more red it was making a humming or roaring sound and it kept getting louder the more red it got. as this was happening i was walking back closer to the house and gradge and it took off with the whitest light that i have ever seen and just as it was flying over me it stoped and i know this sounds crazy and im not religious so anyways it stoped above me and opened up and it was a angel i saw her wings face smiling at me and her feet were crossed and in that short moment she made me understand that everything is going to be ok for us, i never felt more at peace and anyways shortly after she folded up her wings and took off. my mom was heading home from work around 2:00am in the morning and when she was coming close to harcourt she saw weird red orb in the sky and my mother does no believe in that kind of stuff, so when i was telling my story to my mom and dad,she said she also seen something the same night. i don't think that i got anything on my cell but ill give u what ever i can to help? i took a little bit of video audio but i stopped recording shortly after i started hearing weird sounds because i stopped it and ran for the house, i wasn't really concerned about my cell at the time but when i seen the glowing object i tried to get it to record but no success. not sure may have been my own fault because i was so stunned when i seen the glowing object. sorry i wish i could have got it!","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500

goodbye to two friends.  a reflective flash in the sky caught my eye and i looked up and saw a cigar shaped aircraft with one row of windows from front to back heading south at a slow to moderate speed.  i pointed to it and asked \"what is that?\"  everyone looked up and commented that they did not know.  i glanced down to our friends and when i looked back up, the cigar shaped object had reversed its trajectory to the north and was moving at a faster speed. it was not a zip bang, gone speed, but was much faster than before.  it did not  have time to turn around. it simply was traveling in the opposite direction (north) from its original direction (south).  the object did not have a cone shape on either end like the nose of a airplane, but was more like a blunt to soft parenthesis shape like a cigar is shaped. it was a cloudless sky, it had no wings, no lights (as it was daylight), and made no noise.  it almost seemed that the craft knew that it was seen, since it changed direction so suddenly.\r\n\r\ni was very excited, with wonder, to see this object and the others had a more non expression of excitement, almost to the point of being unable to comment.  i could not understand why as this was something that none of us had seen before. our friends left and my husband went back into the house.  i stayed and watched the craft, even going into the yard to watch it, without tree obstruction until it got out of sight.  this sighting has really peaked my interest and i continue to watch the skies to see if i could see it again.\r\n\r\ni didn't have a camera or my cell phone with me, so i could not take a picture of the craft.  i didn't even think of a camera at this point.  i was just amazed at what i had just seen.  i think it was a few minutes later that i realized that we had just seen a ufo!  i have looked and looked on the internet to see if i could find an object that looked like the craft that we had seen.  i did finally find one while looking at ufo aircraft pictures on the internet.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

moving fast in the sky. i had heard there were meteor showers happening that night so i went outside to watch. but, the light was moving very fast and not like the meteors i have seen. then i had the thought it was a planet or satellite. the light was very bright steady white light (no flashing lights) and looked similar in size and brightness to a planet.\r\n            then the light started to slow down and it changed directions multiple times. at this point i had no idea what this thing could be- it wasn’t behaving like the meteors, planets or satellites that i typically see in the sky. i went inside quickly to get my cell phone to take photos/video and get my husband. he then came outside and watched the light with me. at this point the light suddenly changed color from bright white to red. this was really weird to see happen and kind of freaked us out because we had no idea what it could be! when it changed color i knew it was for sure not a planet or meteor. then the red light started to descend even more when we lost it behind the tree line.  it looked as if it was descending toward the ground.\r\n            we walked down the block to see if we could spot it behind the trees. we then saw another white light moving similarly (speeding up/slowing down, changing directions suddenly and then looked to descend toward the ground). we followed it as long as we could before it moved out of sight. we did not see the second light change color like the first one.\r\n            i have attached photos of the light after it changed red. the light looked very large and bright. i took video of the light for at least 20 seconds, i saw the video recording and we only turned it off when the light descended from view but for some reason only about 2 seconds of the video saved….
