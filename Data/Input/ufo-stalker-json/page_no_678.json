faces east and i noticed a red object in the northeast night sky. at first glance it appeared to be an ascending object, like a firework shell perhaps, though not very bright. but as i watched it, i could see it had a straight and level flight path heading southwest.\r\n\r\nso i ran in the house and got my camera. i estimate i started shooting video about 30 seconds after i first spotted the object. between trying to watch the object and shooting video, the object goes out of frame several times. the video also looks a little different from what i saw. the changes in color and luminosity appear more dramatic in the video than what my eyes saw. as the object moved overhead, it looked circular in shape and appeared to have a concentric circle in the middle that was slightly brighter. it's luminosity remained somewhat constant until it began to fade, from what i remember.\r\n\r\nthe object moved overhead, but was a bit to the west of my location, on the south west heading. then i noticed the object beginning to dim, as if the light was slowly being turned off. i had to walk to the west down my driveway in order to visually track it, and it continued to fade out until it's luminosity was zero . i almost get a sense that it was transparent because of the muted red color it gave off and the way it appeared to just fade out. \r\n\r\ni tried to continue to track it's path, but i couldn't. the trees across the street were blocking my view of it's heading shortly after it faded out. \r\n\r\nthe flight path was straight and level the whole time and i didn't hear any sound coming from the object. the sky was clear that night in the area of my observation and my surroundings were audibly quiet as well. my camera is a canon sd750 point and shoot type. it recorded the event at 9:52 pm, but after checking its internal clock later, i found it to be slow by 58 minutes, probably due to daylight savings time. i estimate the sighting duration to be about one and a half minutes.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

in comparison. it seemed to get closer this went on for over an hour. i also did see a few meteors they looked closer. then the object ascended up very quickly were the light was still very bright to see. but far. and it stopped and slowly moved over. now this is why i'm writing this. there was a blueish circular tube that appeared like a cloud the middle was black. the object went into the middle. and then turned to two, or broke off  the one light went through and disappeared  leaving another light which went the opposite direction and then straight up until i could no longer see it. i tried to take photo. but did turn out. has to be explanation. this is the most remarkable thing i've ever witnessed. i looked online to see if anyone else saw what i did. i'm not a crazy person. but i

(not very inventive, i know.)\r\n\r\nso, i was 9 years old, so in year 4 or 5, and i was waiting to go inside to eat my lunch (the year groups are on a rota). i was just standing on “bottom playground”, as my friend was ill that day so i had no-one to talk to/play with.\r\n\r\ni was looking up at “top playground” and watching a frisbee flying across it. i was waiting to see someone catch it, but no-one did. the disc just carried on going, not losing any height at all. that’s when i realised it wasn’t a frisbee at all. it was much bigger and further away, although how big and how far away i can’t tell you, but it was at least a mile, i’m sure of that. the disc was a silver-black colour, looking like your average hollywood movie ufo.\r\n\r\nafter watching it rather lazily fly across the sky for a while, i noticed a second disc, pretty much identical, slightly higher up and further behind the first one. i remember wishing i had a camera on me, but, you know, i was 9 and in the middle of a school day. and i’d wanted to show someone else, but i was too shy to go up to someone and point out something i didn’t even know if they could see. no-one else seemed to have noticed them, so i was sceptical of whether they were even visible to them. probably, but they were all too busy playing.\r\n\r\nwe got called inside to eat lunch, so i turned away, but when i looked back to where they had been a few seconds later, they were gone.\r\n\r\nwhile typing this up, i’d began to wonder if any of this actually happened, or if i was making it all up. i often wonder about that. but then i remembered that that day, when i’d got home from school, i’d told my mum about it, and she put it on a ufo forum, to see if anyone else had seen the discs.\r\n\r\nhere is the post she made (some details are different here, this is due to her misinterpreting what i’d told her when i was 9.):\r\n\r\nlocation of sighting: prestwich, manchester\r\ndate of sighting: friday 18th september 2009\r\ntime: about 1pm\r\nwitness name: anon (a minor aged 9 ½ yrs)\r\n\r\nwitness statement: my daughter told me on friday that at lunchtime when lining up to go back into school after dinner she saw two frizby shapes in the sky, looking from park view school top playground towards bury new road direction. they were blackish-silver and diagonal to each other. the higher of the two then seemed to disappear. she looked away and when she looked back she could not see either of them any more. very strange!\r\n\r\n[originally posted to

making this report, it is 2:16 am on 8-12-15. it was ascending, while very slowly moving to the east. we sat stationary in a chair to make sure we weren't moving and watched the object finally move behind a tree. at that time, we walked down the sidewalk, about 5 feet, and could see it again. it seems the make jerky motions, almost like 2 steps forward, one step back. as we were losing sight behind the tree, we noticed a second object same in color and lighting, possible smaller, or just appeared that way due to distance. it was ascending to the first object we seen, at a much faster pace. we both are very curious as to what it is. we decided to come inside and it could still be seen ascending into the east while the second object seemed to be trying to catch up to the first one.

behind clouds that were high in altitude.   the lights that were red/orange in color had to be large because the lights were bigger than what one would see when looking at an airplane at high

could make the comparison.  the lights traveled in a straight line from northwest to southeast they gave an appearance as if they were traveling on a ladder, but without the ladder.   the lights were equally apart like the rungs of a ladder, however you would not know that there were all these lights until they came on one after the other in sequence.  one would come on then it would go off and

to send it too.\r\n \r\ni also saw a green orb a few years later on our country property sometime in the fall/winter. it looked as though it just floated along slowly went through trees without maneuvering it's path much. it was the size of a large grapefruit maybe? wasn't able to get my phone quick enough to take photo/video.\r\n\r\nnot long after that a friend of mine said she witnessed the same sort of thing on her way home from my house. same size or bigger and seemed to just follow the tree line.

went to the roof of the building when a white flying object in the southwest of the town with an altitude of about one km above and a distance of about the same caught my attention.\r\nstaring at the flying object i was in doubt whether it is a balloon or plane or at least a flying toy of a child playing near around. as it is got closer i saw a light shining at the top of it like the reflection of the sunlight from the surface of a metal. but what was strange is that the object was rotating or it is better to say that it was tumbling while getting closer and closer.\r\nit wasn’t in a standard shape with a whole body in total white. i found out that it wasn’t an ordinary flying object. after 20 seconds it had an altitude of almost 1 km and a distance of about 100 or 200 m from my standing position, when it realized my existence. due to my bad luck it changed its direction to south east and slowly gained altitude to reach the top. in my estimation in the nearest point within me reach the object had the diameter of a ball.\r\ni came down to come up with a camera so quickly. when i returned it had reached an altitude of about 3 km at that direction. it started to circle around with three sudden jumps, then the object went up and up and got disappeared in the clouds. each time the wind moved the clouds i took a photo from the unveiled flying object. meanwhile i got aware of a second flying object with an altitude higher than the previous one in a stationary state. that wasn’t clear enough to be watched. after about 4 min they gained altitude again and moved toward northeast along the clouds. 1 hour later it was almost impossible to sight them clearly.\r\none day later in 23.1 at about 11.30 i went to the roof once again with a camera. after 5 minutes of searching the sky, surprisingly a white shining object took my attention at my left side. it was moving from northeast to northwest with a high speed in a straight line with an altitude of 200 m in a distance of about 400 – 500 m. while i was turning my camera on (after 5 second) it completely stopped and just in one second i saw the object above the mountain like a bolt out of blue. it means that just in 1 second the object has made an unbelievable jump 1 km above the mountain or i have a made an optical illusion.\r\nat that moment i doubt deeply of my observation, if i hadn’t took a photo a day before i eat several narcotic tablets with three day of staying in bed talking to nobody. anyway after the jumps the object stopped for seconds while it was suspending. then it started to circle around upward like a day before and jumped for several times to be leveled with the clouds. i got shocked. i was totally confused. i turned the camera on but before i could zoom on, it gradually paled and disappeared completely.\r\nfor the third time in 27.3.2015 around 11 or 12 pm, i was about to see another case moving again from the southwest to the northwest with a high speed. but it wasn’t recognizable anymore and passed above our house in a completely strange and unpredictable line from those of which observed a day before. the point is that a white translucent light was at the top of the object. in addition its motion in a crinkle way accompanied with increasing in altitude, periodically.\r\nend. \r\n\r\nlocation :iran,shahrekord, tahlijan \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
