States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was 17 years old at the time. on my way to pick up my georgeous little italian date. when i arrived at her house, out in the orchard area of south jersey, a cousin of hers came to the door and said she would take a raincheck on the date because her relatives came in and she would be spending some time with them. so , i left there and drove towards the local diner, in my neck of the woods, { a local hangout }.The road was long and straight with not to many houses on it for miles. im cruising along in my 1956 chevy convertible when it started to miss.It quickly shut off completely. the radio., and parking lights , and dash lights all went off. i put my tranny in neutral, and coasted to a stop. i just stayed in my lane because there was no traffic at all. never was any cars on that road. i checked my gas gauge cause i thought i could be out of gas, then i remembered i had just put 3 dollars worth of gas in itad, to this day before heading out to pick up my date.That was around 9 gallons of gas in them days. that's when i experienced the worst case of fear that i have ever had, to this day.I was looking straight ahead , with both hands on the steering wheel, and i felt that somethace to faceing was sitting next to me in the front seat. i was frozen with fear, all i could do was slowly turn my head to look.I was shaking so bad, but could not move. with my head turned to face the little entity sitting next to me, i saw a small little , what looked to be a chilave an understandindd, looking right at me. and at that moment the fear was replaced with a calmness , that was unlike i had ever known. it was an off white, almost gaseous looking little thing.Its head was barely as high as the back of the seat, and its legs stuck straight out just over the end of the seat. it was very small.By thes time , i am completely calm. it then spoke to me without saying a word. in my mind i heard, don't be afraid . at that time i noticed an expression on its face of a mother looking at her child.We stared at each other for a few minuites, and my mind was on fire with information on many different levels.To fast for me to separate, and focus on any one thing.And then it started to fade , the more transparent it got, the feaat i shouldntr started to settle in on me again. suddenly i was able to move.Just as it was almost completely gone, my dash lights came back on. i looked again and it was gone. scared again, i hit the starter and the car came to life. i put it in gear, and peeled the tires off of it and flew out to the diner. took about 15 more minutes .A couple of my friends were there, but i did,nt mention the experience to them.That was over 50 years ago and ive not told anybody, except for my wife of 48 years, who wouldn't believe even if it had happened to her.Since then i seemed to have an understandind of things that i shouldn't.","distance":"20 Feet or

the small lights, then we tried the iphones, and they still didn't capture it. so we stood there and watched, there were about 30 people on the bar watching it. the formation from my prespective made a rectangule of 5-8 centimeters in the sky, it had a synchronized flux of energy that pulsated down->up. \r\nthe formation started moving really slow and diagonally from sw to s and then moved up. it slightly changed of shape during its course but maitained a synchronized formation. then we were asked by the bar's owner to keep playing, so i didn't get to see it disappear. the next day when i went to check my facebook and a friend of my who is also a musician, was playing on another bar in the same town. he had posted \" what are these shiny dots in the sky? \", then i realised we could have

City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In the summer of 1953 i was a five year old boy who lived on cedar street in phenix city, alabama.  cedar street was a dirt road, with very little traffic.  during the day, it was just as likely to see a mule-drawn cart as an automobile.  i pretty much was free to roam the street because most of the houses belonged to relatives.  while phenix city had a notoriously dangerous reputation, cedar street was a safe area.\r\nthe street ran east/west.  up the hill to the west was a paved road that split towards eufaula, alabama and towards seale, alabama.  to the east, it ran towards the chattahoochie river.\r\non this particular afternoon i walked up the hill to my grand father's house, who had a coca cola cooler in the small building at the front of his property.  i asked for a coke, but he refused.\r\nnext, i continued up the hill to the small store at the intersection of cedar street and the paved highway.  there were a few men at a table outside the store, playing dominoes.  i hung around for a few minutes, but nobody offered to buy me a drink.  so, i headed back home.\r\nas i walked down the hill, i was on the north side of cedar street.  but as i neared my cousin's house, i angled across the road to the opposite side because i didn't like walking past the deep ravine that bordered their property.\r\non two earlier occasions i had seen a large hairy ape-like man amongst the kudzu in that ravine.  although the creature had never threatened me, i was afraid to get too close.\r\ni was about halfway across the dirt road when i was struck in the forehead by a bright narrow beam of light from above.  the beam was less than two inches in diameter.  it made no sound; nor had any \"feel.\"  but, it was amazingly bright to be seen during a mid afternoon.\r\ni gazed skyward and saw a large gray disc suspended very high over the back yard of my home.\r\nimmediately, i was lifted into the sky at a very fast speed.  actually, i did not have the sensation of being lifted.  rather, it was a sensation of \"falling\" up.\r\nmy memory is clouded about the ensuing details.  i seem to recall being greeted by at least three persons inside the craft.  i can't describe what they looked like.  i'm assuming they did not look like \"monsters\" because i did not panic.\r\ni recall being on a table; and something sharp being stuck into my left nostril.  it wasn't painful; but it was uncomfortable.\r\ni also recall being told that it was a beneficial procedure.  they weren't speaking words.  we were communicating via \"thoughts.\"\r\ni was also told to not tell anybody what had happened.  they also told me that the hairy creature in the ravine would not harm me.\r\nnext thing i recall, i was inside my house, standing behind a sheer curtain in the parlor.  i don't know how i got there.\r\nthat night, i woke up in the middle of the night and saw the hairy creature standing next to my bed.  he was so tall, his head bumped against the light bulb that was hanging from the ceiling.  next to him was a shorter, similarly hairy woman holding a baby creature.  the hair on the adults laid flat on their bodies.  the hair on the baby was \"fuzzy\" and stood away from its body.\r\nsuddenly the baby jumped from its mother's arms and bounced onto my bed.  she reached down to pick him up, and the small creature peed on my bed as it was being lifted.\r\nthe father seemed perturbed about the incident, and the three of them exited my room, went through the parlor, and out the front door.\r\ni never again saw any hairy creatures.  but for the next ten years i suffered from chronic nosebleeds and boils on my body.\r\nduring those years, i often \"left my body\" and flew around during the night.  sometimes when i returned to my body, i would jolt so hard, it would bounce me out of bed.\r\ni never spoke of these things to anyone.  i tried to forget they even happened.  i grew up in an area and in an era when things like ufos were not even discussed.  it wasn't until much later in life that i became curious.\r\nafter high school, the nosebleeds became rare.  but, sometime around the year 2005, i began to notice something inside my left nostril.  it felt almost like a small pimple.  by 2009, that pimple inside my nose had begun sprouting something that resembled a stiff hair.  i tried using trimmers to cut the \"hair\" but it would not cut.  one day i grabbed a pair of tweezers and yanked it out.\r\nit was not a hair.  removing that thing was very painful.  it looked like a section of thick monofilament fishing line.  maybe 40 or 50 pound test line.  it was more than an inch long, although less than a quarter inch had been visible when i tried removing it.\r\ni tossed it into the trash.  as mentioned earlier, i never thought too much about ufos.  as an adult, i plodded along as a soldier, a commercial fisherman, and a pest control technician.  nothing special about me.\r\nin 2013 i got throat cancer.  the treatments nearly killed me.  until the cancer, i was an extremely healthy person.  i did not have a primary doctor.  i was never sick.  the only time i saw a doctor was when i had injuries.  the only times i missed work was when i was a bit too hungover from alcohol; and that was

was awaken by a very, very, incredible bright white bluish light that illuminated our entire house. at first i thought it might have been the security police were shining a very bright spotlight into our house. there wasn't any cars around and there were no aircraft in the air. it was totally silent, we knew it wasn't a helicopter, or any other aircraft. we had lived on air force bases our entire lives. it was not an aircraft that we were familiar with at the time or since. it was so bright it lit up our entire yard, in fact it lit up the whole neighborhood with a white bluish tinted light. we could not look at the craft, the light was way too bright to look at. it was like staring into a lit strobe light that was constantly on. it seemed that it was hovering over our house. i became very frightened and pulled my covers to my bed over my head. the light was so bright i could still see it through my blankets. i also noticed my blankets were sparking with electricity. i am unsure if the static was natural or craft related. but i think it was the light that created it. i don't know how long the light was there. i don't remember falling asleep and the last thing i remember was i was very, very frightend. no one we talked to saw it or they wouldn't talk about it. every since this has happened i feel something strange happened to us. i just don't know what, and have been bothered

went to an undeveloped part of the neighborhood nearby, where there was a rising hill, sort of like a butte that we see here in sd.\r\n\r\nwe climbed up and tried to focus a telescope according to

bogota,nj. i have the keys to the store so i usually take and pick up my dry cleaner during off hours.\r\n\r\ni'm heading home, and i stopped to fill up the tire at the local gas station as my low air pressure light turned on. anyways, i jump on route 80 west to start heading home. i'm driving fine, and ready to jump on the garden state parkway south to exit 157 which is route 20 and 21, my direct route for home. so in the process of my getting on the exit lane to jump on the garden state parkway, i notice something hovering over the sky. at first i though it was an airplane, then i notice it was not moving. it was an unusual shape, this object looked like a cross, but all four wings if we want to call it that had a circle light towards the edge of each wing, four lights total.. the size of the wings were even, the lights on them were bigger then average aircraft lights (well at least the one we are use to see). the object appeared to be very dark, maybe black in color. the only reason why i could tell the shape is because the entire sky had a purplish color to it, and the shape was outlined and definitely stood out in the sky. so as i'm taking the exit, i want to be safe driving, there is a guy tailgating me because at this point i'm slowing down trying to find a safe spot on the shoulder to park so i can take a picture of this object. i can catch the object in between the tree lines now, and can barely see it... as i find a good spot to park, i look at the sky, i have full view of it, ny skyline and all, and the object is not there anymore, it just disappeared. i could not tell where did it go. there was absolutely no trace of it. the eerie part about it is that there was no other flying objects (helicopters or small planes) in the sky, i mean you can tell other commercial jets on the horizon, but none around the air space that this object was located in.\r\n\r\nnow, i know you get thousands of report a day... i am 41 years old, i am a system admin, and work with computers all day. personally, i have always loved the skies and stars, so i enjoy glazing up from time to time. i have never filed a report in no shape or form.\r\n\r\nthis to me, was a truly unidentified object. i wish i can tell you that it was a helicopter or a plane, but i have lived in this area almost all my entire adult life, and i am very familiar with the air traffic, and i have never experienced something like this. i was an amazing and scary feeling at the same time. \r\n\r\nyou might just shove this report to corner, but i just needed to get it off my chest, because that butterfly feeling you get when you don't know what's going to happen is still in full effect as i write this, and needed to get it off my chest.\r\n\r\ni really hope i wasn't the only one that saw this, and i hope it can help you in some way or other.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time.\r\naxilea vlachos ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

duress or promises of anything in kind.  \r\n\r\non 08/10/2105, at approximately 19:13 hours; i was sitting in a chair facing a south-westerly direction in my backyard in hartford, alabama; in the county of geneva. while i was watching my dogs as they were utilizing the potty/restroom. i then notice that a passenger jet airplane was flying over from the south-westerly direction heading north-easterly over my residence. as, the airplane was passing you can hear the thrust of the jet in the distance. the airplane’s altitude was approximately 27/30,000 feet and it was leaving a contrail in its wake as it passed overhead. i watched the airplane's trajectory and contrail for approximately 2 or 3 minutes. \r\n\r\nsomething caught my peripheral vision on my right side and i noticed that something else was in the sky following the passenger jet airplane. i immediately called my wife from the bedroom where she was changing from her work clothes to lounging clothes. i wanted her to confirm to me that i was not seeing things or my eyes were playing tricks on me. upon her immediate arrival from the bedroom to the outside back concrete deck where i was now standing and watching the sky; i asked her what she was seeing in the sky, and explain it to me in her own words. the object was approximately 3½ miles behind the jet airplane and traveling at approximately 13/15,000 feet in altitude and following the same trajectory as the passenger jet.\r\n\r\nthe object was triangular in shape, it had no wings, it had no rotary attachments, it was not  leaving any contrail in it’s wake. the object was white or of a silver metallic color and material. the object was traveling at a constant speed and had no noise associated with it’s flight.As we both watched the jet airplane travel in the north-easterly direction; we called our son via cellphone whom lives 6 houses down the street and asked him to come outside his residence and look to the sky to see what we were seeing. the object was still traveling as if in tow towards the jet airplane’s direction. \r\n\r\nas we watched what was happening over our home, our son called us back from his cell phone and informed us to look back towards his residence that there were 2 more triangular, white or silver metallic objects traveling at the same altitude and trajectory as the first object pacing the passenger jet airplane. all of these objects were traveling at the same distance and speed of each other and approximately 4 to 5 miles apart.  these objects were like the first triangular object in which they to made no noise, had no markings, left no contrail and had no wings or rotary devices attached to them, either. all three objects were all similar in shape, height, color and descriptions. i am 48 years old. i have a bs-cj and a ms-shrm from troy university. i am retired from the united states military, army. i held a (ts/sbi w. sci access) top-secret security clearance with access to

but after a few seconds i noticed it was moving down and to the left slowly and seemed to be getting bigger, then it stopped for a few seconds. it then started to slowly descend down and to the left once again for about five to ten seconds and then it stopped once more. at this point it was obviously bigger than it had been when i'd first seen it. maybe nearly twice as big? it then from still slowly started moving over now to the right, in a smooth straight line (maybe very slightly curved downwards like a down facing bracket) level with the tops of the trees in front of me.\r\n\r\nthis all took around 30 seconds and the whole time the object stayed a bright white/slightly yellow colour, like a standard light bulb colour. it then moved quite far over to the right, further than where i had first seen it and it stopped above the trees, but now seemed slightly smaller once again. it then stayed there for about 15 to 20 seconds and then suddenly in a curved tick (right hand tick) shot off in about a quarter of a second. it's final motion appeared to very quickly and smoothly accelerate away and diminish in size in correspondence with it's acceleration in a curve, like the bottom right hand quarter circle disappearing into the night.\r\n\r\ni remember not feeling panicked or freaked out but more like inquisitive and like \"what on earth is/was that object?\"... i stood out in the cold night on my own for a very short while then went back inside, briefly mentioned it to people inside but no one was too interested.\r\n\r\n\r\ni'm not a religious person, i like to make decisions in my life based on real facts of our genuine understanding of how the universe works through science etc, and think there's always a rational explanation and so on... but this one really baffles me! i have a friend i know well who works along side military operations in the uk, and i'd noticed over the years he's always been very closed about his work when asked. a few weeks ago we happened to be on this very subject and he said he's been told there are objects on military radar that just disappear all the time. \r\n\r\nobviously no one actually knows the real facts..Whatever they may be?! could it be natural phenomenon, or drones sent by other life forms as we're doing to other nearby planets right now? who knows? all i know is this was my first ufo sighting of two strange ufo sightings in my life and i'm only 30! any more to come i wonder? :d","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:50","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":69207,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.8993855,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-08102015-0054","longitude":-2.0782533,"occurred":1298937600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1439238235000,"summary":"Venus like object that slowly glided to several different places in the sky, getting larger/nearer then stopped for 15 sec and shot off in curved tick in under half a second.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"GL53 8EG","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1623,"locationName":"Cheltenham, England","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13689"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Chandler","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Was at home watching television when i noticed a bright light on one of my cctv cameras. i then started watching it live and also went outside to see if i could see it better. it moved from side to side, was joined by other spheres and possibly was flying at a low altitude. i noticed that some of the spheres were changing colors and shape. it appeared to be \"square\" but i believe the camera's relatively low resolution may have caused this. at times, they also took on a triangle shape.  \r\n\r\nwatched from several hours and then they seemed to disappear so i then went to bed at approximately 12:45am. i checked the recording that the cctv made and determined it had been there earlier than i first saw it and had reappeared during the early hours of the 8th and then disappeared. it did not return the next night.\r\n\r\nthe sighting took place on the gila river indian reservation which is just south of my location.  my house which is on the side of a hill gives me a vantage point that one would not have if on the ground.\r\n\r\ntiming on one of the files:\r\n\r\n10:53:40 sphere is on and flashing. \r\n10:54:34 second sphere moves in from the west (right)\r\n10:54:48 spheres are very bright.  second sphere is changing colors\r\n10:54:56 second sphere disappears\r\n10:57:23 third sphere is seen approaching from the left(east) and is   located just below the 08 on the date. it is changing colors as well.\r\n\r\nmost of the \"action\" takes place in the same area.  i have uploaded a picture showing the location.  it is just south of a main highway between i-10 and maricopa, az.
