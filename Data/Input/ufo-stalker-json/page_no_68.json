thousands of canadian and snow geese spiraling above a lake just a few hundred yards off the blacktop i was traveling on. i remember thinking how awesome the sight was as it resembled a large vortex over the water. so i decided to pull over to the roadside and take a few photos with my phone. i walked around to the passenger side of my pickup and held my phone up and focused on the lake and geese. the instant i pressed the touch screen to capture the image, i saw a blip, or black flash out of the corner of my left eye. i remember having a strange sensation so i, in an almost frantic fashion, got back into my pickup and drove off. i didnt look at the photo i took for several hours afterward. not because i didnt want to but because it seemed to have no importance compared to that of the \"blip\". but then i looked and saw what i could not explain. i had captured on film a ufo. i have showed my photo of whatever it is to several people who have provided many different explanations but none of which are acceptable to me. i do not know what the object was. i know it was there and gone in a flash. i know it was in the sky using some form of flight and propulsion i am

awesome i just had a vision and there is a craft! i got my phone and took some pictures. in last picture of first craft it appeared to have been sucked in or traveled up into a beam of light which came from very high in the sky to the northwest. the sun was lower in southwest sky. i didn't see it vanish. it just vanished. the picture of the beams of light from opposite direction of sun is why i consider it possible it traveled in the light. i don't know or state that as definite fact. \r\n\r\n4 minutes later a second craft followed it in pursuit of conjunction. it may have been a small jet or a rocket. i photographed that also. \r\n\r\n2 days later i had an abduction experience and ended up in the er on october 23 in exeter nh. had  bite marks of unknown origin on lower abdomen which are consistent in location with the immense pain i felt during the abduction which took place between 3-4:00 am on the 22nd of october. it was absolutely the most painful and upsetting abduction or encounter i have ever had. \r\na cat scan was performed to ensure no life threatening injury to abdomen. \r\nthe bite mark was noted but no ointment or medical care was provided to the location of external injury. saline and pain medicines were administered at hospital. superficial burn was on my neck, posterior and inferior to right ear. \r\n this was not the first time i'd been at the er

off of rt. 33 north to leighton exit and was struck by how bright a star was (there were two stars next to each other but one was brighter than the other).  i thought they were stars since they were not moving, i looked to see where the moon was and it was on the opposite side from them.  as i was staring up at the brightest of the two stars the one to the right which was the very bright one started to dip or so that i could actually see the shape which was a fat triangle with rounded tips to the triangle instead of points.  as i was watching this still trying to decipher what i was actually viewing (and it wasn't a plane not moving just a second of dip to see shape) it dipped to the other side then upright again.  as it dipped for a few seconds i saw the underside to have three large circle of lights at each rounded tip.  i then had to keep driving so i don't know what happened after that.  it was not moving at all and was definitely very bright like a star but dipped and swayed to show shape of a fat triangle with rounded tips and at each tip circular set of lights.  i felt that i looked for anything that it could be and it didn't fit any of those things -- not a

observed what i first thought was an extremly bright star. the object then so quicly went east only a little bit. if i would guess the object was a mile or two miles north of exit 15, then it moved 5 inches left from my line of sight. id guess a football sized length, unsure because im unsure the size of object. then it moved east north east even more quickly until it disappeared behind the trees. this is my second ufo sighting, my second that ive reported this year to mufon although my first took place years ago. i have kept my eyes searching, my heart desperatly wanting to see what i saw years ago. i was not looking for a ufo, i thought at first it was a star until it moved in an impossible aerial manner for any man m.Ade flying vehicle. it was over before i could even grasp what i was seeing. i cant imagine that i was the only one who saw this as there were many cars on the highway and it was impossible to not notice while looking ahead, which was a straight part of highway at that point, which makes the objects turn not an illusion. there is an airport near by but given the movments i know it was not a plane. hopefully it came up on the radar for the airport. this event was not better then my first sighting of 3 objects, and so much shorter. i am so glad to have seen another. i hope that if anyone else saw this that they report it to validate my sighting. before i saw my first sighting, i thought ufo sightings were lies or delusions, but then i became a believer real quick, id sometimes see objects at first having hope its another ufo, only to be dissapointed and observing it as something identifiable, which only made me upset to tell the truth. but tonights was very amazing, not as much as my first sighting, which by searching im sure you can find my description of thhose objects, which is lengthy. to add ot my giddiness is the admission of the pentagons ufo program and release of the jet ufo chase off coast of san diego, which has made my hopes of disclosure boiling. bless what you guys do here and happy holidays. oh and whta i saw was not santa haha.","distance":"Over One

the sky. now, at first, i thought it may be a plane or a helicopter, but this thing didn't move not one bit. its light that it was emitting stayed shining at the same level the entire time. this object didn't have any flashing lights or make a sound, but what was strange was that their was another object at a distance with a bright pulsating light sitting still in the sky, as if it were observing this bright object.  after about an hour three orange lights appeared around the bright object forming into a triangular shape beside the bright object and eventually disappeared, but the bright object remained. eventually, i went inside and went to my room for about an hour and decided to see if it was still out there, and to my amazement the bright object was still out in the night sky in the same exact place with the same light intensity and even the object, that i assume was observing it, was still their as well. for the duration, i am not sure. when i stepped out, the object was already there and i stood outside for a little over an hour and then went inside for about an hour. after being inside i went back out to check and the object still remained in the sky. i am not sure what this is and i am reporting this because, i go out to my balcony every single night and never saw anything like this. i see planes and helicopter flying by, but this was way too weird for me
