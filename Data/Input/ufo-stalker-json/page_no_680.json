from horizon to horizon.  movement would just catch your eye.  we couldn't tell if they stopped and hovered, as we would lose sight of some in the milky way. i've never put in a report before.  it was

gray. while we were watching this object, a single smaller bright light approached it from the south, at t a fairly slow speed. this second object did not pulsate, remaining constant. as it approached the pulsating object, it slowed even more until it merged with it. after approximately 30 more seconds, the pulsating light object blinked out and was seen no

august 9th 2015, toronto trinity bellwood park, public drum circle:\r\n\r\nat around 2 or 3 or so many people all observed a stationary bright star in the blue sky above the drum circle.  theories were many, but the only ones that made sense were weather balloons, stationary satellite reflection, or super-nova.  we could rule out planets, all the bright planets are in leo with the sun and this was well over 90 degrees away from the sun in the middle of blue sky.\r\n\r\nit disappeared and i was excited to maybe here about a supernova in the news.\r\n\r\ndrum circle ended at 6 then there was a yoga and sound therapy class that evolved out of the circle.  while laying in the grass after one of the exercises (6:45-ish) i noted/ blurted out \"hey there is that star again!\"\r\n\r\na few people took notice with me and i would have just let it go myself, until two other identical looking stars moved from left(east) to right(west) at slightly different speeds then each other passing by the central un-moving \"star\".\r\n\r\nnaturally i got up and left the yoga area and excitedly got the attention of other drum circle people who were relaxing and socializing on the lawn.  i showed them the moving two stars flying in slightly undulating yet mostly straight paths in the blue sky,  a small crowd of maybe 8 people gathered and we discussed;  then to our excitement two more \"stars\" following the same flight path appeared in the west headed east and got very close together like the previous two had and slowly disappared, then two more came except these last two (last of three pairs that we observed moving) got close to the stationary star and then slowed there movements substancially and headed north and south slowly out from the one stationary star.\r\n\r\nthese two slowly disappeared over the course of 30 minutes.  clouds would come and go blotching out the one stationary star that remained through-out the observation of the other 6 moving objects.  then we noticed that the stationary star had moved higher during one of it's 'blotchings out'  then with maybe 15 people watching the one star that had not moved slowly ascended higher and higher above us to the point where you had to look straight up (uncomfortable for the neck) to see it.  \r\n\r\nwe all said our prayers for it to come visit us and such.  then me and my friend went to go get some food as dusk began.  probably should have sat and observed it for dusk to see if it emmited it's own light after sundown but we didn't think of it at the time. it was probably around 8 when we left the park, during the long walk we would turn around and still see it high high in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe two obvious interpretations i have are:\r\n\r\n1) weather balloons; maybe with different chemicals lifting them, different weight loads, different propulsion systems???  though the major problem with this is why would the 6 'initially moving' ones all start and follow the same path and then the last two have very different outcomes, why were they able to pass the one stationary one, would the stationary one not have been in the same currents??\r\n\r\n2) e.T.Craft:  alot of the earth is pretty boring and we were having alot of fun, so yeah, makes sense they'd want to stop by and observe us --

seen quite a few on august 8th and 9th. we had also seen various other (slow) moving lights, moving in various directions, which we have always called \"satellites\".\r\n\r\nwhen the triangle formation first came into view, i pointed to it, and thought that it was a shooting star. while following it, by pointing it out to my wife, i realized the there were three lights (not a shooting star).\r\n\r\nthe \"object\" started in the northern sky, slightly west of being directly overhead. it was moving pretty quickly, but not as fast as some of the shooting stars i've seen. it moved directly toward the south, and i lost sight of it, as it became \"washed out\" in the lights of the city. the total sighting lasted about 8 or 9 seconds (roughly).\r\n\r\none of the lights was at the \"front\", and the other two were at the \"back\". there was no flashing of any kind, and the white lights appeared to be all of the same brightness, and did not fluctuate.\r\n\r\neven though i was pointing at it, and following it with my finger, my wife was not able to see it. afterward, i just could not believe what i saw, trying to think of any explanations that i could. i couldn't, so i'm

had already eaten and was not intoxicated.\r\n\r\nit was 10:15pm (+/- 5 minutes) and the sun was well set, a clear night i was enjoying the starry view and waiting for a pass of the iss. i am not totally inexperienced at skywatching and can usually tell a plane or balloon quite easily.\r\n\r\nthe triangle object(s) appeared over rooftop to my south-west on an apparent northerly heading. after around 3-4 seconds on that heading it seemed to curve to turn to a north-west direction and after a further 3-4 seconds was gone over trees. the three orange lights were not very bright and seemed to fade a little more as the object moved away. i could not see if the space between the orange corner lights was filled by some rigid body, i do not recall seeing the stars being masked by it but can not say for sure either way as the orange lights were really the focus of my eyes. my initial feeling was that the object was perhaps 15-20m above ground (approx twice the house height) and moving at somewhere around 20-30 kph. i at first thought the size were in the range of 2m to 4m, along each edge. but after further consideration there was nothing to truly indicate the distance, so no way of telling the size or speed. during the apparent turn the triangle shape seemed to alter slightly this gave the impression of a gentle change in orientation, i can't say for sure if the triangle was true equilateral. \r\n\r\nthe object were totally silent, during the event my mind raced and i quickly wondered if i were watching a kite or drone, but there was no noise or breeze at all. the object passed over multiple properties and fenced boundaries and beyond some trees, a terrible place to try and fly a drone or kite anyway.\r\n\r\ni have also considered birds, in fact it is the only explanation i could consider at this time, but they were three very large and silent birds with highly reflective bellies and invisible wings, and able to fly in a excellent triangle formation. i have since watched for bird formations on the subsequent evenings and seen nothing of the sort.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

second so this makes sense. on the subway home reviewing shots, even tho i need reading glasses which i did not have on i noticed something in sky and put glasses on and was amazed to see a white  cylindrical shaped object cloud color w/linear line going across the bottom of object. tho it is obvious is not a lenticular cloud. object in west sky pointing down/northward at a 300 degree angle. arriving home uploaded to nikon view/transfer/put thru nikon capture program to change raw/nef file to tiff, then to photoshop to make it a jpg. as seen in photo. this is the first time i have photographed ufo. tho once not certain of date, around 1969 night was in neighborhood park bailey ave park, bronx ny, 233rd st. believe i was looking eastward. saw object looked like full moon. could not have been moon because there appeared what looked to be craft, 2? i think, at the time i thought they were air force fighter jets. frozen just aside the object and they would have had to be hundreds of miles across if this were the moon so it must have been a smaller object. and there was a green mist surrounding object. i recall hearing on the news not to worry that there was an airforce test in ny. i cannot attest however that this was the same event. but the event i do absolutely recall. tho i cannot recall the exact year, or whom i was with. i was with one or 2 childhood friends. i was approx 12-14 at the time. file size provided. if absolutely necessary i can provide larger; nef, tiff, jpg, & or i can send the memory card, but only if you feel this is an interesting shot and would be worthy. i have 2 cards. one is hidden elsewhere,not in my home. i did this in case i needed to prove the event. honestly this object appears to be a real solid object. i have been shooting pictures since 1970. began developing my own film in 71 have had various cameras probably 25 in all. i still shoot film, more than several lenses. have experienced all kinds of abberations and lens flare, in this image you can see some lens flare. i believe. the typical type but this does not to me appear to be that. and i know of no type of artifacting typical of digital either. i have images with getty, not many and am familiar with overprocessing and it's effects.  this image was sharpened slightly, and contrast enhanced slightly. i may have increased color a bit but that is all.

looked up at the sky as i always do, and noticed what i thought was a star that was bigger and brighter than the others, just above the tree across the parking lot.  it was far away, but visible just above the treeline.\r\n\r\nas i looked at it i saw it moving just a bit, and this really got my attention.  it lowered to just below the top of the tree and i could still see it through the leaves. it didn't move fast, it just eased down, but there was no doubt it was being propelled. it also appeared to be flickering, and there seemed to be different colors flickering in at times.  i was excited and a little scared.\r\n\r\nit basically hovered there for a while, moving just a bit from time to time.  i got spooked and went back in.  my curiosity won after just a few minutes and i went back out. now it was a quite a ways above the tree and just hanging there.  i watched it for a very long time, and occasionally it would move to the side and up a bit - maybe just a few hundred feet at a time - hard to really say how far it actually moved.  again it wasn't a super-fast move, but definitely propelled. now that it was a little farther away, i felt safer (silly i know), and was just fascinated.\r\n\r\nafter a while, it's way up in the sky and just hanging there. all of the sudden it starts moving a little faster, but in small spurts, like it really might be about to go somewhere.  well, about that time.Out of the corner of my eye, i see a red, teardrop shaped craft cruising across the sky just above the treeline to my right - again, it was far away, but much closer than the one i had been watching, and very easy to see. i immediately shifted my attention to it.\r\n\r\nall i could tell was that it appeared dark in the center, but definitely had a translucent red border (like an aura maybe) around the entire perimeter.  it was moving at a pretty good clip - i'd say it was in my sight for my 5 seconds.  quiet as a mouse - it didn't make a sound. (jaw dropped) i'm not sure why this didn't really scare me - i was just in awe.\r\n\r\nthen, about 5 minutes later, there was a flash in the sky in the general area the craft had passed through.  it wasn't huge, but i would say it was fairly big, and the best way i know to describe it was like a flash on a camera, but it had a star shape to it.  again - not a sound.\r\n\r\nmy neighbor two doors down, has 4 large grow-lights on his patio that he keeps on all night for his garden.  well i'd say about another five minutes after the flash in the sky, his grow-lights flicked off and on 4-5 times.  this is when i got really spooked and quickly went in the house. then i got to thinking it was close to daylight, so maybe his lights were on a timer, and they were just shutting down.\r\n\r\ni waited about 10 minutes and stuck my head out, and his lights were burning bright, with no flickering.\r\n\r\ni only stuck my head out a couple of times after that, and the craft way up in the sky was still there.  i just went out for the last time about 5:45 a.M. central time - daylight is just beginning to break, and the craft is gone.\r\n\r\ni've always wanted to see a ufo - looks like i got my wish! wow!\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":69179,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.46247835914728,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08102015-0024","longitude":-86.82786445500872,"occurred":1439164800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,  A","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1439192750000,"summary":"Bright flickering, moving star-like object.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"35209","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Birmingham, Alabama","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13747"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Belfast","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at home taking pictures of the beautiful sunset. i only noticed the object later when i was looking at the pictures. i didnt know what the object was but looking at my pictures in sequence at could tell that it had changed direction up and down left and right.It looked like a glowing orb that changed shape sometimes round sometimes triangular. i was fairly excited as i have seen planes fly past my house as we are on a flight path but anything before was close and clearly a plane.Well because i didnt see the object at the time i dont know what happened to it. but the pictures clearly show an object that had moved in all directions.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":69178,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":54.60582500000001,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-08102015-0023","longitude":-5.9257599999999995,"occurred":1439078400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Northern Ireland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1439192196000,"summary":"I was taking pics of sunset and looked at the pics later and noticed orbs changing direction.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/Dublin","timeZoneName":"Europe/Dublin","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/69178_submitter_file1__20150809205913.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/69178_submitter_file2__20150809205815.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/69178_submitter_file3__20150809205742.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/69178_submitter_file4__20150809205713.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/69178_submitter_file5__20150809205623.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/69178_submitter_file6__20150809205610.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/69178_submitter_file7__20150809205603.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"Bt36 4qp","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Belfast, Northern Ireland","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13748"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Columbus","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was back in late 1980s , very cloudy an dark ,around 5am.There were no other stars out , i was fueling up my truck and while looking up in the sky i noticed a light , strange because there were no stars out at all ,i finished fueling and watched the light .It went out then came back on.The light showed up in various spots in the cloudy sky,then it moved into another location, i ran in an got my boss ,i pointed it out but he went back inside.I continued watching, the light moved over in a area of a wooded field, witch are houses now, but i watched this light and it all of sudden started to releasing a lighted glitter type substance that came out of it ,it just stayed in the same spot for a while ,then sim to go higher into the night sky ,and then just like that it was gone !
