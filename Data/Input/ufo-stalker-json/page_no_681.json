door at our parents house. she was visiting my wife and i and had coffee and brownies . she said she was going to moms to get ready for bed around 11:00pm . i walked with her . we stopped and sat in my moms yard , her in a pourch swing and me in a lawn chair while we talked. we were there only a few min. when i looked up. straight up for some reason. i saw what looked like a white moon way up in the sky. then instantly it grew in jumps . maybe only 3 jumps in size and it was treetop high . about the size of a football field. it did this in less than a second. the bottom seemed completly flat and now yellow. i stood up and ws looking at the size of this thing and backed over my lawn chair knocking it over.. the bottom began swirling around looking like molten metal redish yellowish orange with white looking like molten metal and it began humming in a pulse like hum. i was standing looking straight up at this thing looking it over for size and height when it starts to hum. the bottom was blinding bright . the next thing i know i blink and its no longer straight up. but my sister is standing right in front of me now looking straight up at an empty sky like i was. shes only about 4-6 inches from my face. i look around for the object quickly and i see the outer edge of it sliding over my parents roof out of sight. i noticed it was bright white now and the tall gum trees had most of their leafs hd fallen off because of the season . but a few at the very top were still on the tree and as this thing slid over the treetops, not making any noises now.., the leaf remained dead still. when it went out of sight i ran arount the house to see it again but it was gone. no lights moving anywhere. i looked at the sky. it was a crystal clear sky the stars looked almost round like a 3-d night. i was walking back around the house looking at the sky waiting for something to move when i came up to my sister half way back. she ask me if i saw it and i told her no. i told her it was gone. we walked back to the pouch swing and both sat it the swing this time. we just sat starring at the sky for a few minutes looking for any stars to move or something to move. my sister said i'll never tell anyone about this . and i agreed. then she said she was real tired and was going in and going to bed. i said me too. and we went in, her in my moms and me at my home. now when we first left my house my wife was going to clean the kitchen and was dishes and pick up the house . both the tv and the radio were playing and all the lights were on in my house.This was , i thought 15 or 20 min. ago. when i walked in all my lights were out the tv and radio was off. the kitchen cleaned and my wife was asleep deep. i was so tired i crawled across my wife and passed out. my wife said she waited up for me till around 3:00am. i dont know what took so long that night and im kind of affraid to find out.I didn't remember this for 6 years. my sister and brother inlaw were visiting and i remembered while we were sitting at the table talking. i said youll never believe this but..I began telling what i saw and my sister said i remember too. i was there too. my brother inlaw had been sterile since he was a teen ager and he and his first wife tried to have kids for three years and the doctors told him he was sterile but my sister had his fist son in june 1983 , nine months later then another one less than a year after that. his first son was covered with staph over his body while my sister didnt have it. im very bad with dates. my sister, while we were with our husbands and wives, helped piece together our memeries for that night. to this point any way.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This occurred in savannah, georgia, about 1959 or 1960. i was maybe 11 or 12 at the time, living on the second floor of an old victorian house on west broad street, with my mother and older brother. i recall there were only three television stations in town, and they usually signed off around 11:30. there was no school the next day. i don’t recall if it was because of a weekend or a holiday. my mother and brother had already turned in. but i was wide awake hoping for a late movie. no such luck. the last station signed off for the night and i was left with no alternative but to go to bed. i slept in a small room off from the main bedroom.\r\nas i was getting undressed i heard a faint whirring sound outside (that’s the best way i can describe it). i flicked off the light and looked out the window toward the park/playground across the street. in the distance i saw a light just above the tree line, how far away i couldn’t really tell. it rose and proceeded in my direction. by this time it had my full attention. \r\nit came close enough for me to make it out as a craft of some kind. under the bright moonlight i could see its shape and the sheen reflecting from its smooth silver surface, which appeared to be stainless steel or aluminum. it appeared to have a saucer shape. from my perspective to the side, it was like a flattened football. there were bluish-green lights dotted along its rim, like the windows of an airliner. at least that part was not spinning, as the sound suggested. the pitch of the sound rose and fell as it moved, indicating speed. i remember being more captivated than frightened.\r\nat that age i was into military aircraft and i could tell you pretty much what kind of aircraft were being used by our armed forces, and most other nations. this was not one of ours (i mean terrestrial). we had nothing (and still don’t to my knowledge) that looked like, sounded like, or could maneuver like this craft. it was difficult to tell the size because i had no way of judging the distance. the impression i got was that it might have been roughly the size of a boeing 707, or a c-130 hercules (military cargo plane). \r\nat its closest point, it stopped dead still and hovered for a few minutes, somewhere between 500 and 1,000 feet up. other than the low whirring sound, there was no noise of engines, propellers or rotors beating the air. then, it abruptly shot straight up and in a matter of seconds it was nothing but a moving dot of light, before it was completely out of sight. i knew for a certainty that this was no natural phenomenon. it was a physical, mechanical object under intelligent control. i have heard some of the debunkers claim that such sightings could be attributed to ball lightning, swamp gas or other natural occurrences. but this was none of that. the image is nearly as clear in my mind today as it was then. what i saw and heard was not something you are likely to forget. \r\nin my excitement, at school that week i mentioned it to a couple of friends. they listened, and neither actually came out and called me a liar. but i can still remember the doubtful looks on their faces. it occurred to me at that point that this might be something better kept to myself. \r\nthis sighting is likely the reason i am an avid science-fiction fan today. i don’t have to imagine if someone else might be out there. i’ve seen the proof. although, i did wonder what the occupants must have been like. unfortunately, i had not yet taken up photography, so there are no pictures. it might have helped if i had awakened my brother or my mother to witness it. but that didn’t occur to me until later, when i was lying awake trying to get to sleep. \r\nat the age of 68 i am no longer concerned about who might consider me a crackpot. and from what i have read, there are other folks at mufon who have had similar experiences. one thing i need to mention is that i was not one of those preadolescents who didn’t know the difference between fact and fantasy. i knew there was no santa clause or easter bunny. my brother and i were usually with my mother when she bought our christmas presents. i used to watch superman, but i knew no one could actually fly without some assistance. when i saw what i saw i was neither sleepy nor deluded. a real, though unidentified, craft had appeared in the night sky above savannah, ga. if anyone else witnessed it – i suppose i will never know.

suddenly shot straight up in the sky with an extremely long tail behind it. i went outside with my girlfriend into my back yard and she proceeded to point in the tree where my dog is saying there was a light that looked like it was through it on the other side, which i then saw too. we saw it again and then heard a strange noise that sounded unlike anything either of us had ever heard before. kind of like a cackle. we approached the area where my dog is and she came out of the doghouse and sat down,when suddenly she let out a yelp and we saw two bright orange light-like things by her side as she ran quickly in the other direction. we immediately ran back to the house because it was dark and we became terrified. i wanted another witness so we got a flashlight and woke my little brother up and went back outside again after trying to explain what we observed. as we walked back out through the yard and got close to the field, and a green-white light literally flew from behind us and went directly over my brothers head about ten feet above, and went into the tree where my dog is tied up. we were freaked out but we stayed to try and determine what exactly what was happening. i shined my flashlight out across through our neighbors back yard and we saw what appeared to be a small child out in the darkness that then ran behind a tree and hid. i turned off my light and suddenly we saw the same bright orange light-like things but there were several of them, some higher than others but all close to the ground in the brush and trees. they were like fiery eyes in pitch blackness without any lights to make a reflection it was very scary! we kept seeing child like shadows walking back and forth in the shadows of the trees and i know sometimes your eyes can play tricks on you but this was a very serious situation and three of us witnessed the same thing. suddenly there was a crashing sound like someone running out of the brush towards us and my brother ran away and at the same time my girlfriend and i saw the same green-white light fly up and over another tree from that general direction and it swooped up then down and then went back upwards in a circular spiral direction before disappearing again. we decided it was time to go and when we started walking away we could hear what sounded like bear feet on the ground running so we hurried up and suddenly saw a child-like thing run along the edge of the cornfield very quickly and it freaked us out in the worst way! we ran down and closed the gate and at which point we heard the cackle sound in several different spots from where we were looking and it sounded like the communication of some otherworldly things then suddenly we heard a pulsating sound that was like something out of a scary movie and so we went to go back around front of the house and then there was a horrid suckling sound in the field out front and as we walked towards it we saw the same green-white light over our heads flying towards the sound before disappearing. it was literally about fifteen feet above us and we decided we had enough so we ran in the house. when i went back into my room i looked out the window where i initially saw the bright white light with a tail fly straight up, and i observed the bright fiery orange light-like things up by the edge of the field there were two of them and then they were gone. there's more to all of this but i wont add every single detail for the sake of lengthy novel. none of us slept that night because we were so scared and baffled by what we saw. i know this sounds like bullcrap, but out here in the country where we live there are some erie happenings taking place that would make you sound like a fool trying to explain to someone. we haven't spoken about the incident but i've been constantly thinking about it and so i started looking on the internet, and i found this site. even with this detailed description, i still feel uneasy and you'd literally have to see what the three of us saw in order to understand... needless to say, we do not go outside in the dark around here anymore. someone please shed some light on this strangeness, i'd love to hear a logical explanation for it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path

have had abduction memories coming back from 20 years ago and have been visited many times.  my friends are scared to hangout with me because at night i will say \"they are up there\", then we go outside and sure enough they see what i see in the sky.\r\n\r\ni have been having intense connections mentally with the lights in the skies for about 7 years now.\r\ni would love for it to be documented correctly with video tape and important individuals who can make it known but don't know where to begin so i decided to come here for help.\r\n\r\nlast viewing, right now today, 8/10/2015.\r\noutside having a smoke, time 1:26am est.\r\nlooked up for the lights, they were there.\r\ncounted, had to stop count because there was too many.\r\nmostly the lights will hover then do quick sharp 90 degree turns but constantly stay in the same general area.\r\n\r\ni am still currently watching the objects and i feel that they know i'm writing this because they want their presence known.\r\n\r\nthe objects will stay up there 3-4 hours or until i get sleepy and go to bed but its every night!!!\r\n\r\ni have grown to accept them and meditate with positive energy towards the situation.\r\ni can feel them when they are around or wanting to \"show off\" their skills.\r\ni have shown many people who literally get up and run away and never want to have contact with me because i have scared them so badly, ex: i told my friend once \"watch this\" and spoke towards a light, \"turn off your light now!\", it immediately turned off.  then i spoke again in the same general area 2 minutes later and said, \"turn your light back on\", within half a second it was back on then flew across the entire sky in under 10 seconds.\r\n\r\ni have many many many examples, literally probably 1000 encounters and would love to meet/talk to somebody who would be interested in fully documenting my experiences because they are extremely powerful.\r\n\r\no and fruit for thought, i have lots of relatives in high up classified programs as well my father has over 40 patents for inventions that people use everyday, so if an ebe was interested in our progress as humans, i might be a good candidate to study....Just saying that's my theory to why i'm targeted.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading,\r\njake

i slowed to 25 mph to have more time to observe lights. lights then appeared to move. approximate speed was 25 mph heading east parallel to me. lights continued east. 1 light appeared to pass the other then take lead. lights continued following mountain range traveling in a north east direction towards me in a intercept course. lights disappeared behind tall trees approximately less than 1/4 a mile away traveling north. i believed the lights would cross directly over my vehicle. i turned off radio and ventilation. rolled down both windows. lights flew over vehicle at low treetop level. appeared to float. no sound or rotor wash. lights glowed no light cast or projected. 1 red light. 3 white lights in a triangle pattern around red light. all lights appeared to be in similar size as traffic lights. lights appeared attached flush to bottom of craft(s). no shape or silhouette observed. only observed overhead for few seconds.\r\n5. curiosity for what it was. joked to self my car

west and looking up into the stars on the beach on platte bay. just enjoying the perfect summer night and in awe of all the stars we could see. had head turned to my right which means i had a view of the northern night sky over lake michigan. when a craft moving at a rate of speed that is unimaginable or definitely unobtainable with human technology caught my attention. this thing was in space way above earths atmosphere maybe satellite altitude give or take a few thousand miles or maybe a little less altitude than that. it reminded me of the way a water spider moved. these little bugs seem to propel themselves in little jerking motions instead of one continuous smooth movement. this thing moved extremely fast but not in a continuous smooth way. it covered my whole view of space above lake michigan form north to south in less than a minute. but i think it was using some type of technology to propel itself that exploded, because space lit up around it and then it would jerk or shoot itself further along its path. it reminded me of what i call sheet lighting or i think some call it heat lighting. but this happened very fast, each time it would jerk forward space would light up all around it for what must of been for a thousand miles way out there and i mean this thing was out there somewhere. so in just a few really fast jerks for lack of better terminology and lighting up space around it in it's region of space it moved in i guess i would say what must of been enormous segments of space. i turned my head lying there to follow it from right to left or north to south. i called out to my wife and she saw it when it was probably even to where we were at or directly west of us. so she saw only half of what i saw. when it got way over to my left or to the south it seemed to kinda of swerve or dodge really quickly at maybe a 45 degree angle into deep space i guess, and it was gone from sight. it seemed to go along a squiggly path at a short 45 degree angle up to my left or south maybe south-west and was gone out of sight. i say a short 45 degree, i mean a short segment of space compared to all that it had just traveled. i mean it was immediately obvious to me i was seeing a display of intelligent technology way beyond anything of this earth. i guess after watching some of stuff about mufon on tv, i figured why not mention what we saw that summer night. i mean that's a few seconds of my life i will never forget as long as i live. i know this was no meteor or satellite. i know i witnessed another type of intelligence of some kind that night. a technology that dwarfs our so much that i think we must still be in the cave man age compared to whatever or whoever was driving that thing. i don't think a human could even begin to even think of surviving the kind of g-forces that might of been generated by that type of space travel. well have a good one and happy

shoreline with a lot of spectators with families on the beach.\r\n\r\ni pulled into the parking lot entrance not driving too close as the size of the ufo was hugh! plus not being a familiar with this big force of a craft i was scared to venture where the other cars were directly under this craft.\r\n\r\ni had my sunroof open and decided to take a quick video with my iphone and proceeded to drive east towards town after a few minutes.\r\n\r\ntraffic was bad so i turned around, and headed back home as i was shook-up from what i saw. i had to drive by the site and was hoping to view from the road. the craft was no longer there and was heading east towards town.\r\n\r\ni proceeded to drive home to download and view the craft on my laptop.\r\nmuch to my surprise what i saw with my eyes and on video were much different. the ufo from viewing with my eye looked like it was hovering at a stationary view. on the video the craft is moving so fast in various directions you have to place the

fargo nd. too a bight of ice cream than casually looked up into the southern night sky. i saw at first what appeared to be two bright close stars. both appeared stationary for about 3 seconds as i first was observing the \"stars\". then the \"star\" on the object started moving very slowly in a straight line away from the other star at and upward and slightly more to the sw sky. at first i thought it was a airplane at cruising altitude, but on closer observation there were know signature green/red blinking lights, and no observed jest sound, which i always here for planes that high on calm nights like this one. i though of the possibility of it being a satellite, but that would not make sense because it was stationary for a good 2-3 seconds in respect to the other bright start to its right. the interesting thing is the object slowly got dimmer and dimmer until it vanished as it traveled along its straight path. i considered the possibly of it being a shooting star, but this was not a good description because it moved way slower than a shooting star, and it did not have a characteristic flash/emission/glow as a shooting star, plus the object/star was stationary for a good 2-3 seconds when i first saw it. i have seen many shooting stars before, and trust me, this was not one. thus i failed to identify what it was, not a star, plane, shooting star, nor a satellite, most likely was not a weather balloon either. at the time of the sighting, it was a gorgeous calm clear sky summer evening. there was a plane in the southern  direction on the horizon on mid-approach from the south into hector international airport at the time of the my sighting. \r\ntotal length of observation of the star like object was 8-10 seconds from first seeing it stationary to it disappearing as it \"faded out\"\r\n\r\nalso i was driving by the airport this afternoon and saw an f-15 or f-18 grey jet fighter at the jet center, which was a very unusual thing to see for how many times i been around there.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:08","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
