and there was another red orb underneath it.  i looked over to the west and saw another red orb hovering.  the two orbs to the south at about the same time dimmed.  the started moving south and started blinking.  i looked over to the orb in the east.  it looked like it was moving towards me to the east.  it went dark and into the clouds.  it did not come out of the clouds and must have reversed direction.  the cloud cover was half clouds to the west and all clear on the east.  bindery was north south.  as the two red orbs blinked out they moved south then looked like planes leaving the area.  i am a sky watcher we live on the midway airport flight path.  i am use to planes looking very bright as they are miles out coming in.  the size and the bright color of red they were lead me to believe they were not planes.  when they all three dimmed out at the same time i thought maybe they were planes.  i was wanting to see if anyone else saw.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

said there was a ufo above her house and it had been there for a couple of hours. unsure of what i was seeing, i went to her house to see it for myself. sure enough, there was something in the sky that appeared to be spinning on an axis, very quickly, and had multi-colored lights that were not normally seen in the sky. her father, who was in the air force for 30+ years, said he had never seen anything like it and was quite convinced it was a ufo. i went back home and looked in the direction of her house and sure enough, i could see it from my yard. the next night, i went out around sunset and as soon as the sun went down, there it was: in the same spot, hovering and spinning. being a photographer, i ran inside, grabbed my camera and tripod, set it up and started taking photos. i did long exposures so i would know if it was moving in a weird pattern or not based on the star trails around it. sure enough, the object was all over the place in comparison to the star trails. then i decide to record the object. i put the largest lens i had on my camera (not ideal but it did the job) and focused as best i could on the object, which mind you was far enough away that it looked like a large star, and hit record. \r\nthe object appeared in the same spot multiple nights in a row and it actually slowly, but surely, descended below the tree line. by 9:30pm-10pm i couldn't see it anymore but without fail it was there the next night. this went on for about a month or so and then it just stopped. since then, i have seen weird lights in the sky around my house but nothing as constant and bright as the one i saw in october of 2014.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":69137,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.39424255746234,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08092015-0029","longitude":-86.2465836267803,"occurred":1413577440000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1439150395000,"summary":"Object

no trail of light/debris, it was not a naturally occurring type light either), no falling satellites reported.  my daughter and i were certain we just witnessed a plane falling from the sky but again, no plane crashes reported in the area.  it happened very quickly and it fell from the sky in an ark like angle and then disappeared behind the tree/house line.  it looked as if it was less than a mile away, possibly within a few blocks where we were from but hard to tell because all we could see was essentially a blue falling light.  my daughter said that in addition to the blue light (which remained solid in color and was a bright vibrant blue color) she saw flashing white and red lights which made her believe it was a plane that was falling.  i believed it was a plane because the light i was seeing was not a natural light (it wasn't the type of light you see with a shooting star, a falling star, or a meteor and the way and speed it was falling was also different) it was more like a light you would on a plane.  i was very, very surprised when i found no reports of a plane crash or anything else that could explain what we saw. it looks like it will remain a mystery!\r\n

she knew of a natural hot spring. the road is high up in the mountains.It took approx. 15-20 minutes to get to the natural hot springs. we had entered the road from the main trans canada highway, since we were vacationing in radium hotsprings.\r\n\r\ni took a few pictures of the area once we arrived. we were both amazed at the natural beauty of the scenery. i'd say that the trees were surrounding the area and we were in the middle of the mountainous area. the road has been used quite a bit to get to a smaller community further down the road.     \r\n\r\nwe felt a heavy presence watching us after being there for about 5 minutes, we both felt alerted to the presence. we also assumed it could possibly an animal. we waited for about 5 minutes looking around wondering if there was a type of bear or cougars around. but we did not hear anything moving in the bushes near by. \r\n\r\nwe felt a bit uneasy but okay at the same time like it was not threatening but of course being in the middle of the mountains you have to be on alert for possible cougars and bears as well. \r\n\r\nwe both changed into our swim suits with our backs turned to each other, lol so we did not look at each other. lol  there was a running river near the natural hot spring area which was beautiful. \r\n\r\nthere were about 4 pools that were manually structured with rectangular rocks around the natural running hot spring. i took one pool and my friend took the other pool to soak in. \r\n\r\ni still felt the presence of being watched but i did not say anything to my friend. i was enjoying my soak. i do not know how long we were there but i said to my friend, just to let you know i am not watching you. lol \r\nshe started to laugh because she felt the same way and felt like something was watching her.It almost felt like a flash of time went by when we were soaking in the hot springs, because we both said at the same time are you ready to leave?, yeah it's time to leave. so we both got dressed and went to my friends car.   \r\n\r\nthen we seen another car stop and pull into the same area we were in and we left the same way we came. we seen deer's and i took pictures of the animals on the way out of the mountains. we talked about our experience being there and we chalked it up to being animals and my friend said very weird.\r\n\r\nmy friend that evening was very sick, she said she had a head ache, was puking and dizzy. we were in a hotel at radium hot springs. i tried to comfort her by giving her water , but she's an independent women so she really did not need my help. if she needed anything i was there to help her. \r\n\r\ni was looking at the pictures i took from the day and just thought of how beautiful of a surrounding we were in and i was in awe from the pics i took at the natural hot spring area. then i noticed something out of place in one of the pic's from there. i noticed a bluish white light on the top of my pic near the top of the tree lines. i thought wtf is that and zoomed in on it. \r\n\r\ni was shocked and i turned to my friend and said her name,  omg!!!!  look what came up in our pics from there!!!! this is what was watching us!!! she went omg! and got sick again. she even said that she is probably sick from the radiation that it could have exposed us to. i agreed.\r\n\r\nwe did not see anything there physically, but we did feel a strong heavy presence of being watched. to the point of both of us being a bit paranoid. so here are the pics.   \r\n \r\nif you turn the pic vertical, you can make out the shape of a full size body outline from hear to toe in the middle of the shape. the out line is in the middle of the brightest lighted area. enjoy!\r\n\r\ni have before pics of the scenery without the entity and there of course after.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ","distance":"21-100

sitting down talking like usual and then my friend said he was hearing some weird exploding noises or some type of explosion or firework ( i'd like to add that fireworks are illegal in utah at this time) so he goes to the window and he sees that the explosion they're coming from the distance southwest of us,we could also see flashing lights in the distance where the explosions are coming from. after approximately 5 to 10 minutes of pure loud exploding noise everything went silent so we went back to hanging out and talking then my friend decided to go check out and see if he could still see the lights but when he looked outside he saw some silver/grayish metallic object fly over his house at incredible speeds, he immediately told us to rush to the window so we ran towards the window and pop our heads out and above us i saw 4 disk like metallic objects flying towards the south, they were all in such a precise and organized line. after the ufo sighting me and my friends decided to go outside to see if we can spot any more and this is where it gets strange where we had been hearing the explosions come from, birds and not just a few birds, but thousands of birds were flying  away from that direction. we stayed outside for 2 hours for those whole 2 hours hundreds and hundreds of birds just kept flying away from that direction. we believe the explosions were coming from a secret military base that we actually saw on their way back from my trip to idaho. we did research on this facility because when we had passed it we saw a bunch of officers patrolling the area and whoever would get close to the base would be stopped and questioned. i've never reported ufo sighting for the risk of being laughed at but this was too strange to ignore i had to report it to someone i think the strangest part was when a bunch of airplanes were headed towards the direction where the explosion / lot of noises were coming from. i'm left here without answers what went on that night. thank

it blinked three times and quickly (5 sec.) disappeared in mid air.  it made no noise or crackling/hissing sound as objects do when descending through the atmosphere.  it was a very bright orange, steady and stable colour and intensity until it suddenly went out. it appeared much like a light bulb: steady, consistent brightness without pulsing. i estimate that it was about one to two miles up and within 5 miles of where i stood.  it may have been descending but, it was a very slow descent. it turned dark/faded/disappeared within ten seconds after turning to the west, it was no longer visible after this point.\r\n  i have seen two very distinct unexplainable craft of obvious non-human origin in my lifetime, i have seen a failing russian space rocket reenter the atmosphere and burn up as it descended.  this case was different from both as it was clearly an orange ball of light, not flame or fireball.  the perseid meteor showers are late tonight but, they are not in our atmosphere.  i have seen many, 'falling stars,' meteors, etc.  this is not like anything i've seen before.  i am a longtime sky watcher, amateur astronomer;

my direction. as i watched them for awhile (3 -5 minutes) and it appeared that the one closest to me was flickering and then a 4th one joined in line. there was 4 total that i saw that had a fireball like appearance. they were larger and closer then the stars you could see on this clear sky night. i walked over to get my wife and ask/show her, but when i returned they where gone. we stood looking trying to figure out what it was. in a short time later a fellow came up asking if i saw the strange lights in the sky. he said this without me saying anything about what i saw. i told i'm i did and he went on to tell my wife and i the same story i just told her. i wish i stayed and watched after he said that 2 went one direction and 2 the other. sadly i missed that. \r\n  the funny thing is we live near an airport and see many types of aircraft all the time and know it's not unusual to see them lined up. but we are not at home and these weren't plains lining up to land. i'm not sure what it was. but fell strong enough to know thieves 4 lights were different.","distance":"Over One
