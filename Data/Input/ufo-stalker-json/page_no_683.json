(we were 100% sober). we had almost reached hwy 6, we were traveling north. i noticed an extremely bright, glowing stationary light ( blue-ish white) in the western sky. i said, \"is that that bright planet? it seems lower and brighter.\" he replied that the planet venus, was further to the right of the bright light, or north, and i saw the planet then. he said, \"well, it has to be a plane then, or a new tower light or something.\" i knew there were no towers in that area, and we had seen a few planes earlier, since we are near the cedar rapids airport. we reached us hwy 6, stopped at stop sign, and turned left (west) onto hwy 6 towards marengo, & towards the object. it's 4 miles to marengo and our turn into town, going north, at the ampride gas station. as we drove, we rolled down our windows, drove slowly, about 45mph, and never took our eyes off the hovering light. as we neared the object, it stayed stationary, approx 25 ft off the hwy from us, hovering over a cornfield( which had not been planted yet) about 75 feet in the air. the object was triangular in shape, a solid black color, with criss crossing, almost fluorescent looking bar shaped lights all across the bottom of the entire craft, mainly white and bright blue. we were in absolute shock. we had to turn right, off the hwy, to head into town. we instead turned around in the ampride drive to keep observing it. just as we did that and were going to go back the way we came to keep watching it, it suddenly started moving slowly east, but steadily. it looked huge, and it was just gone. we started driving into marengo and i turned to the right, looking east, to see if i could spot it. it was hovering 4 miles away near the highway intersection, exactly where we had turned west onto hwy 6. it went 4 miles in approximately 2 seconds! we just stated at each other, basically in shock. i have always been a believer, and have had a few incidents in my 50 years of life. but my friend, who is a sports editor, photographer for the des moines register, and has been for over 30 years, had never really truly believed in ufos, aliens, etc.... and he takes his camera with him everywhere, but for some reason, forgot it. he called the ampride station, they didn't see it but thought it was very cool. we bring it up in conversation frequently, if not daily. we were almost directly under it. i've never seen anything like it in my life...There was no noise, and the speed of it was nothing of this earth.  it went from hovering near the highway with bright lights, noiseless, to hovering again directly east, 4 miles away, in under 2 seconds. we will never forget it. def a ufo.","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1

not live too far away.\r\n\r\nthere was a power cut and all of the street lights in the local area were out of action. as i walked down her garden path to make my way home i stopped for a moment to take in the night sky as the stars were very bright that night.\r\n\r\ni started turning my body towards the northern sky to see if i could find the big dipper/plough formation and then to my left, in the western sky, i noticed movement. \r\n\r\ni turned to visualise on whatever it was that was making this movement. i then saw two egg-shaped craft that were flying parallel to each other suddenly come flying over my mum's home. they were roughly 20 feet apart and they were flying at probably no more than 70 feet above ground level. i would estimate the length of the craft as being somewhere between 30-35 feet, and the height at the widest point of the craft as being somewhere around 12-15 feet. i estimate their speed was probably no more than 70mph/112kph, and it seemed as though they were trying to blend-in with the night sky by using some form of technology that projected the night sky onto the outside of their craft. this technology was failing though as the two craft kept flickering for a split-second before the whole of each craft became visible again. it was not possible for me to make-out what colour the craft were as it was too dark, but they made a slight noise as they passed overhead which sounded like air being blown quickly out of pursed lips for a couple of seconds. the two ufo continued flying in a straight line in an easterly direction and i lost sight of them within 5 seconds as they passed over the roof of the house opposite my mum's home. i ran out into the street to see if i could still see them through the gap between the two house on the opposite side of the street, but i could not see them anymore. \r\n\r\nif i hadn't have been looking directly up into the sky that night i would not have seen them and nor would i have suspected that two ufos had just flown over my head. they had no lights nor any other distinctive features, and the sound they made was so slight i would have assumed that birds had just flown over. \r\n\r\ni couldn't sleep that night as i was too hyper. over the next two weeks i had three very vivid dreams about grey ets, so make of that what you will.

hard to describe. they also moved very quickly away from each other- very fast! they also were moving to the east and higher up as they went. as for their general movements, they just seemed to 'flutter/reflect' around each other is the best way i can describe it. also, the further east they went, the harder it was to see them, eventually just star like dots then they were gone. it also looked like each object gave off a sort of wispy, cloud like, whitish emission, but i can't be sure because it was so faint. they moved very fast around each other but slower as they rose up higher. i tried to focus in on them with binoculars and my fiancee' tried to take video of them but it was nearly impossible because they 'flashed' so quickly. we were able to see them from 2:00 p.M. until

park on 8-30-14 sitting at the picnic table enjoying the night as i did not have to work that night.As i was sitting there i was facing the east looking south out towards the lake.I noticed a red orb moving in a north to south path.It frightened me enough and surprised me enough that i instantly started filming a video with my phone a samsung galaxy s3 as it was moving along its flight path.I watched it as it moved towards the horizon in the south.It appeared to pulse in color change from red to orange not real fast but more gradual in change.It vanished over the horizon and in a few minutes it re appeared from the south only to travel about half of the sky before stopping and going back to its original heading.I am not sure of its exact altitude but it had rained that day and it was still covered with clouds and this orb was under the cloud level.I was visibly shaken as i texted my sister about this event.It isnt my first experience with ufo's and since i like astronomy i knew it wasnt a sattelite or a plane that i have ever seen.I have seen sattelites and meteors and even watched the iss as it passed overhead once.I was wondering the next day if it would be back i even expressed that thought to my sister.\r\nthe next day 8-31-14 as i was sitting around getting ready for work that night i kept looking to the north to see if it would come back.I was not disapointed. at approx 9:12 pm it appeared again i started taking a video but i cant hold still long enough to take a steady video so i started taking some pics again with my samsung galaxy s3 only thing is my flash was turned on.I did not want the orb to see the flash but i was too late.I turned off the flash and started taking pictures again without the flash.The orb slowly continued its previous flight path of north to south.The orb went off the horizon in the south it was at approx the same altitude as the previous night.Then as i was looking a southerly direction it re appeared moving in a northerly direction,it traversed only a little ways from the horizon when the orb started running a east to west pattern what i would call a search pattern.The orb covered approx half of the sky in this pattern back towards my location,i was getting concerned that it was looking for the source of the flash,you could see the orb as it made its turns going east to west and then back west to east repeatedly.The orb seemed to vary in its color from bright red to an orange color.It finally made its last turn and got to almost its original path heading south when it stopped running its pattern and turned to the south and vanished over the horizon.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
