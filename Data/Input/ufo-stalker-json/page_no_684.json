in my surroundings while relaxing by myself and nature.  this is when out of no where about 8 or so lights just appear across the river.   when they appeared my first thought was birds getting the

began recording (and not all the lights show up in the videos but multiple ones do) at this time it's pretty windy and i'm just watching these lights cut through the night sky.  at one point about 4 lights split off from the group and go to the left side of the shipyard dancing around and flying at incredible flight movements.  i was so shocked by what i was seeing u can even hear in the videos

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This was about 20 years ago; i was at my house in beaver, pennsylvania with a friend on a summer night 1995 (approximate date). our other friend showed up at my house on his bike saying that he just saw some fire trucks with their lights on so we should go check it out. we jumped on our bikes and quickly rode towards our school near gypsy glenn road because that is where he last saw them going. we saw some lights that we thought could be the trucks way up on the hill but then they flew over the hill out of sight. we thought, \"oh it was just a plane\" and turned around. we were half way across our practice soccer field when we turned around and rode back towards my house. we only made it to the parking lot/tennis court area when we stopped because there were 3 objects flying toward us in a formation. the objects had 3 white lights on them, which stayed constant, they did not blink. they were far off at that point, maybe 1 or 2 miles and first i thought maybe they were planes, but the lights seemed odd. they were also in formation, which was unusual. then the 2 on the sides flew off at an incredibly high rate of speed in what had to have been a 90 degree angle, both going in opposite directions. that is when we became frozen and speechless out of fear and amazement. we knew we were really seeing something uncanny here. the object in the middle continued to fly directly at us, going at a slow rate of speed. too slow to stay airborne i thought. now we got a better look at the object. we could see that the 3 white lights were at each corner of the object, making a triangular shape. really the 3 lights were all i could see, the object was so dark i could not make out the exact shape even as it flew overhead very low, only 50 to 100 feet. it continued overhead, not off to the left or right, directly over our heads. today that is the fact that bothers me the most. whatever it was had to have seen us, or was aware of our presence. throughout the whole experience, even when it was directly above us, the objects made absolutely no sound. the object kept flying on the same path at the same speed over our school and over the hills out of sight. now we began to talk again, yell actually as we were very excited, confused, and a little scared because we really did not know what we just witnessed. we know we all saw the same thing, and my two friends would corroborate my story if you were to ask them today. after it was gone we kept riding our bikes around my neighborhood there by the school with our eyes to the sky. there was a lot of air traffic that night, much more than usual, but none of those objects came anywhere near as close as the other 3. all the objects in the sky that night did appear to start going in the same direction, but i’m not able to say for certain which were planes and which were ufos. i can say with 100% certainty that these 3 objects i just described were ufos, as there is no object i am aware of that can fly with those varying speeds or fly that silently. excited we finally rode back to my house where we told my mother what we had just seen. she did not give it a second thought, dismissing it saying that it was a plane. i have talked about this event a lot over the years, but have never reported it officially. i will never forget it though, and i will never stop searching for answers. i think this is the right thing to do and i hope that my story is helpful in some way. obviously, the truth is out there.","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

pulled the cord and it shocked me he left and it was still daylight, but the next thing i remember is it was dark and i looked up and saw the object in the sky over me and to the right. i have had many dreams about this over the last 46 years and i was watching a show about people being hipmatized and they could remember or give more details about what happened. i know i was on the object and remember light and shapes but not much more. if there is any way you can help me would be very much aprechated.I still have dreams about it and sometimes can't sleep at night because of this thing that happened to me so many years ago.The last thing i remember is the craft moving off slowly with the lights going round and round on the bottom of the craft. all i can really be sure about is that i was by the lawn mower after being shocked and it was daylight and when i saw the craft i was still in the same place but it was dark outside. i have been confused about this all my life and wonder if i have been conducted more than once in my life and the dreams i've had are real and not just dreams. leading to me not being able to sleep after i am put back in my bed. can you help me? after this happened i started drawing the head of an unusual shape that i can reproduce at any time and i had never drawn anything like it.I know i was only about 10 years old but i still remember like it was yesterday. i was never scared or remember being hurt in any way. but i know what i saw and i don't understand why i would start drawing a head that looks very much like a gray. i was 10 and didn't

this us government testing center is located just outside of tullahoma, tn.. and is located adjacent to a wildlife preserve so at 1+ am in the morning it's pretty dark. the highway is approx. 12 miles in length and is for the most part lined on both sides by towering pine trees which lends it's self to what i describe as providing a shotgun view from the drivers seat. there are numerous dips but fairly few curves in this highway and a few side roads. as i remember there are three personnel gates to the center all on the left. one of the main side roads sort of tees into the access highway from the right that is road that employees from winchester, tn. use. when approaching this road the highway makes a fairly sharp left curve and opens up to where it is about 200 feet open areas on both sides of the highway. so that area opens up to where ones sight lines are vastly improved for several hundred yards.\r\n    anyway,....On this night i was on my way into work at about 1:15 in the am, after having pasted gate 2 and a small construction gate the highway makes a small gradual dip then rises into the few hundred yards to the winchester access road. just at the lowest part of the dip the night, which was almost pitch black, the night instantly lit up like a cloud less mid summer day. i saw a huge brilliant circular orb of light approx 100 ft above the pine tree tops just passed the far side of the left curve and just beyond the winchester access road. it was so bright i could not see into this orb. i could not see what was emanating the light. it projected solid shadows, was totally silent and moved from a position on my left toward my right a cross the winchester road kind of like a hot air balloon might in a stiff breeze. the orb moved through my sight line in approx. 3.5-6 seconds. at the time i jumped on my accelerator to get to the tee in the road and look toward winchester. it took maybe another 6-10 seconds to do that and when i looked,...It was no longer there, pitch dark again. i had several co workers that had their own experiences at the center. i got into work a short time later and told my supervisor what i had experienced and he said, 'do you what to make a report' i said no because i had no proof. if one takes the time you can find these roads and highways on google earth or any map app. \r\n i want to thank cassidy nicholas for encouraging me to follow thru and submit this report,....Thanks cassidy,....\r\nif interested i can provide maps, sketches or a verbal interview,....And that to mufon for all you folks do.

he could go to the bathroom before we both went to bed. he is very sick, and he would not go out until i went outside with him. the sky was very clear and still, with no noticeable wind or cloud cover whatsoever.\r\ni then spotted an object in the sky that was highly unusual, and not at all like the normal airliners that overfly my house, which is located in the flying lanes of detroit metropolitan airport which is located just south of me in wayne county.\r\nth object was located around a mile or two away from me and at 45 degrees of elevation, just south west of my position. if i faced directly south, the object was located 15 degrees to my direct right, and it was flying very slowly at almost a walking pace. it was flying on an unwavering and steady course of west to east at an estimated altitude of around 8000 feet, give or take a few thousand feet, and it was flying at an altitude of much less that than half way up in the air than a normal airliner would be flying at if it were flying at the normal cruising altitude that i always see airliners overflying my home.\r\n\r\nthe object was not emitting any sound whatsoever that i could detect over the background noise of the freeway that is very near to my home, and at that late hour, traffic on this freeway was almost non existent, so there was very little if any background noise to be heard. \r\n\r\nthe craft was very much unlike any airliner, for example a 767 jet, in that it had four steadily glowing white lights, of which one was in front, one was at the rear, and one each was located at the midsection on either side of the object, and it had a red light that flashed or strobed very intermittently and very seldomly, where sometimes seconds would go by before the light would strobe, and the strobing intervals were very random. the red strobing light was located right in the middle of the bottom of the craft. this was the only spot where the red light would strobe from.\r\nthe craft also had a white light that strobed very infrequently, and very randomly, and i also believe that the location of the strobing white light varied as to it's position on the craft. this white strobing light was also very random as to the periods when it would strobe, and sometimes seconds would go by before it would strobe again.\r\n\r\nthe craft had a very distinct and pronounced outline that was definitely not like any airplane that i have ever seen, nor was it a helicopter or any other type of light aircraft. i have seen all types of aircraft in existence at this time, including classified military aircraft, and this did not resemble any of them either. the craft was also not a drone of any kind.\r\n\r\nwhen i spotted the ufo, after i just stood there and observed it for a few uninterrupted seconds, i came to the definitive conclusion that i was looking at something highly unusual that i had never seen before.\r\ni then ran into my home, grabbed my video camera, and ran back outside to take a video of the ufo while i turned on my video camera and opened up the tripod that i had the camera mounted to.\r\ni had been outside two nights before to take video footage of the unusually bright and large full moon that was present at that time, and the weather was unusually clear and quiet, so i did take some superb video footage and photos of the full moon with my camera mounted on a tripod. that is why my video camera was mounted on a tripod and ready to shoot video at the time of this incident.\r\n\r\nit took me 3 or 4 minutes just to get my video camera, run back outside, turn on the camera and extend the tripod and then run to the fence on the side of my property, and then finally get the camera focused onto the object. it took me another minute to get the object in my camera's sights, get the video camera and tripod combination balanced against the wooden privacy fence that borders my property, and then get the craft into good focus. by that time, the object had passed by my location and was now just south southwest of my position. i started taking some good video footage with the object in good focus and zoomed in, an by this time i was filming the left side and rear of the craft. the good quality video lasted for about two minutes, and after that, i lost the object in my video camera's screen because the object had passed behind a branch of a large tree that is located adjacent to my property in my neighbor's yard.\r\ni tried to re-acquire the object in my camera's viewfinder screen, but because of the fact that my video camera is not especially good at taking night time video, i could not find it again. \r\ni then ran through the back gate of my house to the front of my house, and then i ran to the corner of my street, located directly to the right of my home and one house away from me, so that i could obtain an unobstructed view to the east of my location all the way to the horizon, and the ufo had completely disappeared from my view.\r\nthe ufo had to have either turned off all of it's exterior lighting, or it had to have sped away from my location at a very high rate of speed, because it had only taken me about a minuet from the time that i lost the object in my camera's view screen, to the time that i had arrived at my street's corner, for the object to completely disappear.\r\n\r\nwhen i had first spotted the big and very visible ufo, there was another object flying directly in front of the larger and more visible ufo, and it was located a couple of miles in front of it, directly in the ufo's flight path. this other flying object was visible only as an intermittently strobing white pinpoint of light, which had no other visible lights at all on it's exterior, and it had no visible shape to it as well.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

lightning in a storm that was approaching.While we were taking the videos we did not see the ball of light it was observed the next day while i was reviewing the videos.I took the videos while facing northwest at the back of the house.There is a farm field and woods there their are no home or street lights or any other kind of lights there.I have attached both videos and 3 still shots from the first video. i contacted our local tv station to ask their weather staff whether they thought this could be ball lightning or something else they did not respond.I am pursuing this with you because clearly lightning hit the ball of light twice it seems way to big in comparison to the lightning to be a plane.We at first thought it could be a light reflection caught on the camera but again clearly reflections don't get hit by lightning.What did we catch on film can you help with an answer thank you scarlett
