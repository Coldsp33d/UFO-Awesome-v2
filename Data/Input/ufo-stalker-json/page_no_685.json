house which makes me want to share this story in hopes of finding out if it has happened to anyone else.\r\ni was living in cayucos california in 2008-2009 and was 19 years old. my mom was staying at her boyfriend's house for the night and so i slept in her bed. she lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment by a restaurant and bar across from the beach. cayucos is a very small quiet town at night and everyone knows each other. i woke up suddenly in the middle of the night because a very bright warm light was shining in my face. the head of the bed was under a big tall window with a piece of my mom's stained glass art in front of it, with a gap at the top of the art that you could see out the actual window, which was maybe 5 inches wide. the light that shone down must have been coming from very high in the sky to have made it through the gap in the window and onto my face! i remember feeling so scared and like somebody was watching me in the room so i cornered myself in the dark bedroom and called my sister from my cellphone. i woke her up and i cried and asked her to drive over to help ease my fears. she decided not to and said everything is fine so i sat in bed a little longer and then got up and walked into the living room and looked out the front door. no planes, helicopters or any body was around. this coastal town is super dead at night. it was so quiet and still it really spooked me. i decided to look up and i saw what looked like 2 stars perfectly parallel to each other flying across the sky. they looked very high up but not as high as satellites. if you held your arm out and put a space between your finger and thumb they would be around 2 inches apart. i watched them fly pretty quickly until they were over the roof and i couldn't see them anymore. i ran back inside and sat there trying to figure out what could have woken me up. i don't remember anything else. i recently talked to my mom and she brought up her own experience without me even mentioning my story to her. she said one night she was woken up by a super bright light in her face from the sky. right after she told me this i told her what happened to me. she said she fell asleep right after she was woken up which seems typical for her. i wonder if anything happened to us. i've seen a couple ufos at different times in my life. i'm pretty scared but still very interested and curious and have studied about this sort of thing for years now. i would really be interested to hear if anyone else has had something like this happen specifically the waking up to warm light in your face.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It happened in the summer, of 1983/84, in the town of madison nj, the town in which i lived at the time. i was 17-18 years old. i and a friend were waiting in my car for another friend to come out of his house so we could start the evening. just driving around town and stuff (we were teenagers). we were parked on the side of the road facing east in front of a small field on keep st next to the towns ymca. the street is shaped like an ell making a90 deg turn 500 to 1000 ft ahead of us. from where we were parked you could see thru the backyards through the ell shape to the road farther up at a 45 deg angle. as we were talking, i was parked on the wrong side of the road, so i could see through the yards, and i saw what appeared to be a cars headlights pulling into a driveway of a house and the lights were reflecting off the windows. but something seemed strange about it, and as we talked i noticed my friend glancing in the same direction taking double takes or looks, and i could tell he thought something was off too. finally i said, do you see that? and he said yea, what is that? then i said, isn’t that that the second floor? by that time i had realized the reflection of the lights, which were unusually bright were reflecting directly off the houses 2nd floor windows. by that time my interest had peaked and i started the car and raced up the street turned right at the ell and preceded to the house were we saw the lights. at that point the object or craft was hovering above the house. i pulled up in front and i saw a large craft, about the size of a large house, just hovering. it was completely silent. it had four or more lights evenly spaced around the bottom. i was really excited and really scared at the same time. i wasn’t sure what to do. i wanted to get out of the car but was too scared. i was very close, about 100 ft give or take a few feet, away. even though i had a clear line of sight the craft was very difficult to see. i could see the lights on the bottom and could only make out the shape by the amount of sky it blacked out. i feel like i saw more, being i was so close but its really fuzzy in my mind for some reason. this has always bothered me because it seemed to get fuzzy right after the event. i know this is something i would never forget. i had better than average eyesight at the time. anyway the craft started move up the street just above the houses and treetops. i chased it in my car and then it stopped. at that point it was farther away from me so i got out of my car to get a better view. as soon as i got out, i was just in time to see it shoot straight up at an incredible rate of speed. i followed it with my eyes till it appeared to look like a small star in the sky and then it shot off to the north in a right angle and disappeared making no sound at all during the whole time i witnessed the event. i thought it was very strange it made no sound at all, no engine sound or movement of air. i was so excited i couldn’t wait to tell people about what we saw. my friend was too, but he didn’t see as much as i did because he stayed in the car. some people were very receptive about our story, most weren’t. i soon learned not to talk about it because of looks i would get from people. i could see it in their eyes. i only discuss the incident now with close friends and my kids, or people i deem open minded to such a thing. i have an intense interest in cars, aircraft, motorcycles, boats, ships, computers or anything mechanical. i have taken flying lessons and have flown several different types of airplanes. i have a very good working knowledge of aircraft and there flight characteristics. this was not any type of aircraft i have ever seen in my life and i am 50 years old. i have studied all aircraft types, just because i am very interested in them. have been to countless air shows. this thing was not from here! it did not behave like any known air craft i have ever seen. the way it accelerated and turned would have killed anyone on board. this was a life changing event for me. thirty two years later i still think about it almost every day. occasionally i will run into my friend who was in the car that knight and will ask him about what his thoughts were about that night and he acts very weird. doesn’t say much. that’s out of character for him. just another puzzling detail about this whole experience.","distance":"21-100

days ago on the first or second of august, i went to post some pictures on my facebook page. it was then that i noticed something in the one i took of the spires. i saw that there was something in the

my mind for – well, most of my life, i suppose. i don’t know if submitting this report will help me get any answers. i don’t even know if this is the kind of report you guys usually deal with, or, if it is, if anyone will get around to reading it. doesn’t matter, i guess. at the very least this will be therapeutic. \r\n\tit’s a long story. i’ll begin at the beginning, because context is needed. as a child i was always very interested in ufos and aliens. not unusual; what little boy wasn’t fascinated by them? but – and i don’t know if this was concurrent with my fascination or if there was some abrupt change – i was also terrified by them. i had recurring nightmares about seeing ufos or begin taken by alien beings. they are among my earliest memories, these dreams, and they so affected me that i began to dread the night. i didn’t want to go to sleep, because i knew that i would have one of these dreams and/or i would wake up in the middle of the night, frightened and feeling terribly alone.\r\n\ti grew up in a big old house in milwaukee, wi, near lake michigan. it creaked and groaned and did all the things old houses do that frighten children. eventually we moved, around my teens. i have lots of good memories from that first house, but every time i think of it i feel a reactionary sort of unease or creeping dread. i hated being alone; even if there was someone in the next room or on the floor above me, being alone made me feel uneasy, jumpy, like i was being watched. things only grew worse when i eventually got my own bedroom on the second floor. everyone else slept downstairs, so when i went to bed i would be truly alone in the dark. \r\n\tthroughout this time, i can always remember my dread and unease focusing on aliens. yes, occasionally a ghost movie or something would frighten me, but never as badly or as regularly as the ufo/alien phenomenon. it got to the point where just seeing an image of a ufo or a depiction of an alien made me uncomfortable for the rest of the day, and i knew it would be a rough night. but at the same time, i was still fascinated. i wanted to research everything i could about them, about ufos, and about the encounters people had. it was a paradoxical relationship – i was, ultimately, the author of my own discomfort.\r\n\twhen we moved to a new, smaller house, some of that unease went away. all the bedrooms were on the same floor in the same hallway, so i didn’t feel quite as alone when night came. aliens and ufos still fascinated and terrified me, but the dreams stopped, or at least came far less frequently and were much less intense. \r\n\tthen, just before starting high school, i was in a barnes & noble when i came across whitley strieber’s communion. i wasn’t looking for it, didn’t even know it existed, but that famous cover image literally stopped me in my tracks. it was somehow different from all the other depictions i had seen, despite bearing all the classic hallmarks: large head, dark almond-shaped eyes, minimal features. it still has an effect on me, even though i can’t place my finger on what exactly makes it unique. i had to pick up the book, and i knew that i had to read it. i did, that very night, all in one sitting. i finished early in the morning. it scared the hell out of me, but it also felt right, somehow. maybe that’s why it was so frightening – because it felt like strieber was describing something i already knew so much about, more so than any other encounter i had read about. i don’t know if there was an ounce of fact in that book, but i was and still am struck with the feeling that he got it right.\r\n\tagain, despite being terrified, i was also fascinated by communion. i read it twice and was left feeling like i needed more. i was searching for answers, but i didn’t really know how to ask the right questions. it became a sort of obsession throughout high school. \r\n\ti began to look back on my life (short as it was), at things that had always struck me as odd, standing out in my memory, but which i had managed to ignore. i began to, i guess, notice them more. i was familiar with the common hallmarks of supposed alien encounters, but it wasn’t until reading communion that i began to notice how many of those could be found in my own life. i realized that, in one form or another, the alien/ufo phenomenon had been a running theme throughout my entire life, just beneath the surface. for the first time i actually began to consider the possibility that i had had at least one encounter.\r\n\twhat follows is a list of the events that have always stood out to me. it’s in as close to a chronological order as i can manage. years and age-ranges aren’t specific, and probably aren’t that accurate; my memory isn’t great when it comes to time.\r\n\r\n•\tthere are the dreams i previously mentioned. these are among my earliest memories and my earliest remembered dreams, occurring maybe until i was in middle school. they stand out for being so vivid, so recurrent, and so terrifying unlike any of my other nightmares. there are three that i remember specifically:\r\no\tbeing with my father in his truck driving at night and getting picked up by a ufo, the classic saucer-shape. \r\no\tstanding outside my old house at night, before a large bush that grew near the driveway, and talking to or hearing something in the bushes speaking – something i somehow knew was not human.\r\no\tbeing in a large white room with other children and alien beings who were sort of like caretakers. i remember being very frightened of them, though the other kids seemed fine, and of trying to run away by climbing a kind of ropey structure, like you would find on a playground. one of the beings was following me, trying to calm me down, i think.\r\nthese dreams have always seemed to me to be dreams, yet they’re more vivid than most memories i have from the same age. \r\n\r\n•\tanother one of my earliest memories is of someone climbing into the bedroom i shared with my sister through the window closest to my bed. this is odd, since our bedroom was two stories off the ground (the old house was a duplex). i can’t remember what the person looked like, or anything that happened before or after; i only remember lying in bed, looking past my feet towards the window, and seeing someone coming through it. i have asked my sister if she ever remembers me telling her about this, and she confirmed that i once said someone had come into our bedroom at night.\r\n\r\n•\tyet another early memory, in the same bedroom. i’m lying in bed when bright light comes through the windows, a sort of “sunset” light, if that makes sense. something floats into the bedroom, near the ceiling; something i can’t describe. the best image i have of it is sort of pancake-shaped, maybe the size of those flying disc sleds; i also have the impression of it being somehow organic. i don’t know if this was a dream or something i saw on television and confused for an actual memory. regardless, it had a strong enough effect on me that, what i think must have been several years later, while visiting my grandparents, i felt uneasy while standing in the bedroom at their house and seeing the same sort of “sunset” light (from, i’m assuming, the actual sun) shining through the windows.\r\n\r\n•\ti have, at least once, fallen asleep and woken up in two different places. in my old house, after moving to my bedroom upstairs, i once spent the night in a bed downstairs because of how uncomfortable i was upstairs. i woke up in my own bedroom. it is entirely possible my dad moved me in the night, or that i even sleepwalked. \r\n\r\n•\tmy family has a cabin in the northern part of wisconsin, near a small town. it’s fairly isolated; there are neighbors, but a bit of forest between each cabin. initially i loved going up there, and still do enjoy it; but gradually i began to feel the same sense of unease that i experienced in my own house, specifically at night or when alone. perhaps this has to do with me being a city boy and going out into the country. i don’t know, but several things have happened at that cabin.\r\n\r\n•\tone winter, at the cabin, i was walking at night with my dad. the cabin is on a block about two miles around. while walking we saw a bright orange light or sphere moving swiftly and silently across the sky. eventually we lost track of it – i don’t remember exactly how. probably it passed behind the trees or over the horizon. either way, not long after it disappeared we saw what looked like your typical satellites, a lot of them, converging from multiple directions on where the bright sphere had been.\r\n\r\n•\tafter moving to the new house, not long after reading communion, i was reading in bed at night (the book was jurassic park if that matters). i distinctly remember lying on my back and glancing at the clock sitting on the desk at the foot of my bed and seeing that it was eleven, and also seeing that the hall light was on (i slept, and still do sleep, with the bedroom door open; having it closed makes me uncomfortable). the very next thing i remember is finding myself in bed, on my side or stomach, book on the floor, feeling not the least bit tired or like i had just woken up. glancing at the clock, i saw that it was now three in the morning, and the hall light was off. it is possible i merely fell asleep while reading – but if so, then it was an instant and very deep sleep, unlike any other time i have fallen asleep while reading. i wasn’t tired while reading, and it has always taken me a long time to get to sleep – it almost never happens before midnight, even if i go to bed early. regardless, the event struck me as strange.\r\n\r\n•\tduring the summer, one year after i first read communion, my dad, sister, and i went up to our cabin. i went up there with a secret plan: i would go out at night and…see what would happen, i guess. i had read about people who could supposedly make contact through meditation and mental will. it seemed worth a shot. i wanted answers and was willing to try. each night during that trip i tried to go outside by myself late at night and walk up the road to a clearing where i had a good view of the sky. it was almost impossible for me to do – i was terrified and never made it beyond the driveway, until the final night we were there. i took a flashlight, told my dad and sister i was going to go look at the stars, and actually managed to reach the clearing. i spent maybe a half-hour or forty-five minutes, focusing very hard on wanting to make contact, or to see something, anything that would give me answers. nothing happened, and i hurried home. my dad and sister were still up, but i decided i was going to go to bed. i felt fine, very calm, which was a bit unusual, considering how nerve-wracking the experience had been, and how long it had taken me to work up the courage. i fell asleep almost immediately, which, as i mentioned above, is also unusual. i remember having a brief dream, in which i woke up the next morning and went to the mirror to see symbols etched into my skin. they were not there when i woke up, obviously. it was sunday and we were going to church. while waiting for my sister to finish in the bathroom so i could use it, i suddenly got a strong nosebleed. there was nothing i can think of that would have caused it; it was summer, and right near the lake, so not very dry. i think, but i’m not positive, that it was preceded by a sharp pain in my sinus. either way, i was understandably unnerved. eventually the blood stopped and we went to church. on the way home my dad asked, what i believe to be out of the blue, if i had gone outside last night to look for ufos. i said yes, and asked why? he told me that late last night he had been aware of a “presence” in his bedroom, but saw nothing. my sister then told us about a dream she had had that same night: she was in a sort of hospital room with lots of beds, occupied by girls her age, some of whom she said she recognized from school. there were doctors there placing a box-like device over their stomach area to see if they were capable of becoming pregnant. it’s possible they both knew i had gone to look for ufos the previous night and had conspired to mess with me the next morning; i don’t know. my sister seemed upset, though, and just as frightened as me.\r\n\r\n•\tthis might have actually occurred that same night. i’m not certain it didn’t, but either way: while at the cabin my dad once asked me if i had been reading in bed late at night. i told him no, and asked why. he had seen a bluish-white light outside his bedroom window, coming from the direction of the bedroom i shared with my sister. i had a reading light that is quite bright, which is why he asked. \r\n\r\n•\ton another occasion at the cabin, after the event with the nosebleed, i have a brief but strong memory: of waking up in the middle of the night, unable to see or move, gripped by the most powerful terror i have ever experienced, and knowing that i had to make myself move, now. i don’t know why. i remember nothing before or after. it could have been a dream, or sleep paralysis. either way, it wasn’t pleasant. \r\n\r\nafter the event with the nosebleed i became, understandably, obsessed with finding out what, if anything, was going on. i began to sleep worse than ever and couldn’t concentrate in school. eventually my dad noticed and told me that i need to step back, let it go. full disclosure: there is a history of bipolar disorder in my family. my dad was worried about my obsession and how it might be affecting my mental health. \r\n\ti agreed to let it go. i decided that i knew only one thing for sure: i have no idea what the hell is going on, if anything. i had no way of finding out, and no way of changing things either way. so i stopped my research, stopped my endless wondering, and just tried to focus on other things. it worked, for the most part. i still am and always will be interested in the alien/ufo phenomenon. it still frightens me, still occasionally keeps me awake at night. the events i have listed still stand out in my memory, and i still occasionally go on a ufo kick. but, after graduating from high school and all throughout college, i experienced no new strange events, as far as i am aware. \r\n\twell, that’s not entirely true. in the winter of 2014, while walking at night with my girlfriend, i saw what looked like two very bright stars in the sky above our neighborhood. almost as soon as i saw them they began to steadily fade until they had disappeared completely. there was no movement, no sound, no anything. the night was clear, so it wasn’t a cloud passing in front of them. i’ve actually already submitted a report about this on mufon. \r\n\tone more thing: my dad has had similar unusual experiences during his life. he has told me about at least one potential ufo he saw, and about a childhood dream in which little doctors took him out of his bed at night. he has also noticed that electronics behave strangely around him. several times the tv has turned on or off randomly when he is in the room, as have other electronics. there was an incident at the cabin, which he actually caught on film, during which a plant was weirdly attracted to him, as if by static charge. when he moved close to it, the plant bent towards him; when he moved away, it stood back up normally. it only happened with him. we’ve never seen anything like it before or since. \r\n\ti hope this wasn’t too long. i don’t know if i’ve been contacted, abducted, or had any encounter of any sort. there’s enough potential evidence to make me think, and i don’t think i’ll ever stop wondering. i guess, by submitting this, i’m still looking for answers. if you think it worth investigating, i would love to communicate. a part of me is scared to dig into this any further than i already have, scared of finding out that i’m crazy, or of uncovering memories that would be better off left alone. but the part of me that wants answers trumps the frightened part.

color as the first ones we saw in 2013. the difference was that it was very cloudy so they were not brilliant or the shape obvious except for one which was clearly an orb and so bright it actually made me squint before it too appeared to go behind the cloud. after that group, a pattern of four floated across the same path slowly and i ran to get the camera and i got video of those. about as soon as i shut the camera off more came. these were closer together and there were several. they followed the same path from left to right as the others. i highly regret not turning the camera back on. my bf was insisting they were planes regardless of the obvious which might have been the reason why.Lol the next day he agreed they were the orbs. you can even see the fiery color in the video somewhat. we saw some on august 22, 2013 in the same part of sky. he saw them maneuvering in a play-like way and moving at extremely high rates of speed, disappearing and reappearing..Etc. by the time he called me out (so i didn't think he was nuts..Lol) there was just one hovering in the same spot for about 5 minutes. i could see pulses of light emitting it's right side. it got lighter color and
