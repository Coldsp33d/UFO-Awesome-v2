better term, “sphere”. it made no noise that i could detect, but there was considerable noise in the background as fireworks were going off in the surrounding area, as it was well after dark on july 4th. as i watched the object drift into the east it seemed to start glowing more reddish and seemed to fade in and out somewhat as it got further away. at this point i gave up looking and went inside. whatever this thing was it just baffled me. it could possibly have been a drone, or maybe an elaborate chinese lantern, although the wind was wrong for that- i checked weatherbug after i went inside and the wind was supposedly out of the south at 5 mph, although it seemed to be a very still night with no detectable wind. i’ve also seen chinese lanterns and they are very unstable in their flight paths and ascend and descend abruptly depending on updrafts and downdrafts (and they don’t glow a solid orange either). this object was in a very stable flight path, although it seemed to be ascending slightly as it got further away. i can’t really say what height it was nor the size of the object. \r\nat the time i was in a condominium complex approx. a quarter mile south of 14 mile road in novi

turned at the garage. i saw an odd object in the air that hovered for a moment over my (other) neighbors house- i imminently knew what it was from watching documentaries. it was a small, all white object- i was in fact very surprised at the size of it. if i were to guess i would say that it was only about a 10 diameter object- a rounded top with a slightly darker shaded white. it was also fairly round at the bottom of it- it was fairly round in general. so i saw it, and i was mesmerized- it began to move, but was not even making a sound. it was silent, there wasn't any noise being emminated from anywhere. it moved, and i didn't say anything- i slowly stumbled towards it as it went over across slowly in one direction into a field. past the powerlines- i was moving very slowly towards it and after that it moved in a straight path behind a treeline. shocked, i ran over to my mom and told her all about it- but i'm not sure about what she said to me about it but i remember her being fairly calm about it. i didn't think too much of it over the years and didn't see anything else. no little green men, or even another saucer.\r\nthen the other day i was reminded of it and drew a documentation of it in mspaint.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

to be attached to a body of anything like a plane. the light did not blink or change in any fashion. i was looking down on the cascade mountain range so i know it is not a star because it was below me. the duration of the sighting was three to five seconds. the size of the object was bigger and brighter than that of a star. the object was moving very quickly. if i had to guess it was about 3000 feet below us and the pilot had said we would be flying at an altitude of 19,000 ft. about five minutes later we were flying over i90 close to ellensburg washington, the sun was setting but i could still see cars moving along the highway. so when the object was observed i still had plenty of light to make my observations. i asked the person sitting behind me if she had seen anything but she had not. the rest of the flight was pretty normal. \r\n\r\nnow the odd thing beyond seeing a bright orb was i saw something similar back in march 2014 from my home in walla walla. before the plane took

traveled vary slow and spun as we were talking about in the front or what you can call the front stared to vanish slowly and rise up in to the air the lights on it were vary dim it made no noise there were three other people on the hill i dont know if they seen it to but we got out of there fast because we did not know what we saw but it was not a plain or helicopter at that time our city had no

to do a little star gazing and to look for a few passing satellites as they are so easily spotted in the night sky. as i was looking almost completely straight up  at a small cluster of faint stars something caught my eye. i saw a very small oval shaped object solid red in color moving fast and very high across the sky. it was moving approximately 8 times faster then a satellite moves and i watched it change direction about 4 times, it moved from one side of the sky to another in a very short amount of time. this object remained the same red color and did not very in brightness. it was about half the size a observable satellite would appear. this object did not sparkle or change brightness subtle like a star or satellite does but remained a solid red color almost like a lazer point. i am confident i was not observing a satellite as i definitely know what satellites looks like crossing the night sky. the object did not slow down in speed when it changed direction but turned quite sharply. i thought about taking a video of the object with my cell phone but decided it would not of turned out very good due to the size speed and altitude of the object. i actually  attempted to try but the sudden brightness of looking at my cell phone screen and looking for the right button to push ruined part of my viewing experience as i had a hard time adjusting my eyes to the night sky and searching for the object again, but i did luckily eventually spot it again and viewed it for another few minutes. i eventually stopped looking at it due to the fact that i was really straining my eyes and my neck was hurting from having my head so tilted back looking up. i had a hard time falling asleep wondering what i saw. it was a very surreal experience.

super-slow by comparison.  the object was a deep, illuminated blue in color and again was traveling super-fast. as it pulled away it appeared as though it had at least one tiny red light on the top of the blue. the object itself appeared blue, it was not an aircraft light and timmerman handles smaller aircraft, so i'm quite sure this was not the typical aircraft seen in the sky in this area quite frequently. sadly i was driving at the time and unable to pull over to attempt to get a better look, and it sped away so quickly i doubt i could have gotten a better view anyway. the most important

i lost some validity, after i sent in a report on july 4th thinking at the time it was 100% a ufo. only to find out it was sky lantern, which apparently is a common firework or display. i feel like anything i say now, won't be taken as serious. besides the embarrassment...\r\n \r\nbut i have pictures this time...But besides that this event that took place is actually about to get a whole lot weirder, its actually very odd. so, i was sitting at dinner with my folks, and out of nowhere, i started to converse with them about an article i read earlier in the day, which was a story about neil armstrong's convo he had with nasa. something about aliens on the moon, and nasa kept requesring him to change frequencies/channels, or something of the like.\r\n\r\nbut, i started talking more about the possibilities of life beyond earth, and what might be really out there, and i don't know maybe it was a premonition or something (i'm getting chills thinking about it) but it was at this time my mother looked out the window and she said \"look at that.\" i looked out the window, and well i just figured it to be a plane. maybe she was excited about the story i mentioned earlier, who knows? and well i looked and didn't think much of it.\r\n\r\nnext thing i know she says there are two now, she asked me do planes fly that close together. now, this had my attention. i go in my backyard, and what we all witnessed were three orange orbs in a triangular formation flying/hovering very slow in the distance of my back yard.\r\n\r\ni was so stunned, we all watched in awe. especially after our convo, it was all sorts of freaky. finally my father had sense and got his camera, his ipad camera. my mother followed pursuit and got her iphone also. \r\n\r\ni didnt want to miss anything, this is a once in a lifetime observation i am witnessing ( it truly was a show, and i still cant see any purpose to the methodology of their flight pattern,  regardless though, it was really awesome.) anyways, finally sense kicked in me to grab my camera even one picture might help make the difference.\r\n\r\nby the time i got back outside, the top ufo disappeared...But three more appeared in almost a straight line behind the original triangle, but they were blinking in and out so fast and randomly, it was difficult to count them all total, or where to even focus the camera, because when some disappeared others reappeared. but i would say with certainty, there were about 5-6 in the sky at one time. \r\n\r\nplease let me know what you guys think of this, i promise what i say is a true story, maybe i added to much additional info, i really don't know when you ask for details if i am to detailed, but that is what happened with the event i witnessed. what i do know is this was all very weird, just the odds of me talking about \"aliens\" and immediately witnessing a ufo is mind boggling to me. \r\n\r\ni'm willing to answer any questions you need answered, also two other witnesses observed this happen besides myself. thank you for your time reading this.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving northbound on the garden state parkway. as we crossed over the mullica river, i looked out over the river to the far left to see some of the sunset scenery. i often take pictures of sunsets from bridges while i'm in my car. i live on an island so i observe sunsets from a bridge quite often. the setting sun was partially behind a cloud. i noticed that directly to the north of this cloud, was another pretty cloud. as i turned to marvel at that cloud i immediately noticed a black spot in front of the 2nd cloud. the spot was very dark and did not appear to be obscured by the cloud. i asked my passenger if they could see it too, and they could. we both stared at the spot and tried to figure out what we were looking at, the shape was not any known shape that either of us have ever seen. it did not resemble a plane, helicopter, kite, balloon, or any animal. it looked round on the left side and like 2 unequal rounded steps on the right side. at no time did the object make any movement, it looked like it was just part of the sky but blacker than anything we've ever seen in the sky. it wasn't reflecting any sunlight & did not have any lights, which i specifically checked for when i was trying to decipher whether it was an aerial vehicle. it did not appear to be anchored to the ground by any ropes and did not move in any direction nor have any movement itself. the object looked to be pretty far away but i can't imagine anything that would be big enough to see, yet appear to be that far away. if the object was closer, then it should have been close enough to identify. we both assumed that the object had to be pretty large in order for us to be able to see it that far away while not being able to see enough detail to figure out what it was. we were both shocked and we were asking each other what the heck it was that we were looking at. we did a quick rundown of what it might be, plane, helicopter,kite, balloon, weather, and we both said it didn't resemble anything we could think of. it did not move at all. we both agreed that we were looking at something we haven't seen before and we both questioned whether we were being affected by the distance of the object and maybe couldn't see it right but the size, distance, color & movement of the object just did not add up to being anything man-made or animal that we know of. we did not notice the object or anything else in the sky an hour earlier, when we were heading southbound on the parkway through the same area where we saw the object. we also didn't notice anything unusual or the object in the sky before we reached the area where we saw the object. it was as though nothing was in the sky and then the object appeared. as we finished going over the bridge, we were coming up on the new gretna toll, we could no longer see the object due to trees being in the way and because we were lower than we were on the bridge. unfortunately, by the time we figured out that we were looking at something worth photographing, it was too late to still see the object.","distance":"Over One
