la piscina en dos tumbonas hablando con un amigo, la hora era las 12,40 aproximadamente, principios de agosto de 1992. en un momento de la conversacion en la que nos estabamos mirando hubo un flash potentisimo,  de luz muy blanca que ilumino todo lo que me rodeaba dandole al contorno de las cosas matices azulados, como el flash de una camara de fotos pero muchisimo mas potente y de luz mas blanca, esa luz vino de encima de nosotros y al mirar hacia arriba vimos una estrella fugaz que se dirigia al oeste y tres luces que formaban un triangulo equilatero.\r\n\r\nlas luces de ese triangulo equilatero eran de color anaranjado, de luz fija, muy visibles pero sin ser brillantes y muy grandes con respecto a las de un avion de pasajeros.\r\n\r\nsi las comparo, diria que las luces de un avion de pasajeros son como una pelota de ping pong y las 3 luces serian como las de una pelota de baloncesto. la altura a la que a mi me dio la impresion que estaba, es la de un avion de pasajeros y su velocidad era lenta, algomas lenta que cuando vemos pasar un avion a gran altura.\r\niba en linea recta y deje de verlo cuando el cipres de la casa vecian me tapo la vision , me levante rapidamente e intemte seguir viendolo pero los arboles no me dejaron ver y para cuando corri a la parte delantera de casa de mis padres habia desaparecido.\r\n\r\nintente asegurarme de lo que habia visto y de que no me estaba equivocando y me fije en las ventanas de la casa de los vecinos que estaban cerradas por si el fogonazo podia ser una camara, pero no habia nadie y nunca habia visto un flash tan potente, no habia nadie ni se oia nada.\r\n\r\nmi amigo se quedo sorprendido, pero cuando lo conte al resto de mis amigos el no dijo nada , no lo nego pero no ha querido volver a hablar de lo ocurrido.\r\n\r\nesto ocurrio en una parte de la ciudad un tanto apartada, pero muy cercana y esa luz tuvo que verla alguien mas , a no ser que iluminase solo las parcelas mia y de mi vecino.\r\n\r\nescribo esto porque en uno de vuestros programas de television se decribio un objeto con las mismas caracteristicas al que vi y quisiera saber si he tenido algun error de percepcion o tiene alguna explicacion logica.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

after all these years. i was getting ready with my mother & grandmother to go to the neighboring town to look for a dress for the upcoming homecoming dance.  when we left our home we noticed a very bright light (star, we thought) in the eastern sky.  it was early evening.. maybe an hour  to 1.5 hrs of daylight left.  as we drove further into the countryside, we were aware that this \"star\" was getting closer and closer.  there were no other vehicles in our area and my mother pulled over to the side of the road to get a better look at this object, because by now, we knew it was certainly no \"star\".  it  flew over our car very low and very slow.  as it approached, my mother wanted to get out and see it,but i was so scared and pleaded with her not to get out so she did not.  we had rolled down the windows to look at it and i did not hear any sound whatsoever... it was perfectly silent, not even a hum and i knew that there was no way it could be an airplane.  it was the \"typical\" flying saucer shape.. rounded with a domed top.  the car did not shut off or anything like that... it just flew over us. after it passed over, it picked up speed very quickly and zoomed straight up until it, once again, looked just like another star. \r\n\r\ni have since then been involved in aviation for the past 40 years and have yet to see any kind of experimental, military, or civilian aircraft.  i recall this so intently and thought i would share my story with you folks.","distance":"21-100

same\r\nabout his time i was bought a digital watch...I was unable to wear it \r\nas every time i did it malfunctioned....Initially we thought it was\r\nfaulty but after two replacements it was obvious it was me...I also \r\nbecame mildly psychic knowing things eg.. i was in local supermarket\r\nand lady cutting cheese to order...I ordered a pound of cheese and she cut\r\nit exactly to weight...The next thing i know i tell her that she will do this three more times... the next customer ordered a pound and she cut it\r\nexactly...She then said that well see if u are right and cut a further to pieces off the block...They both weighed exactly a pound...My friend was present and very surprised...As i was\r\nabout this time i became aware of a piece of metal in the heel of my foot...It was greyish about one fifth size of matchstick...I have no idea how it got there and i would be aware of pain if i had trodden on it...\r\n\r\n\r\n7 sunset avenue woodford green essex 1984?

would wake up with blood on my underwear; and not from my bottom where u would expect. the blood was from above my legs around my ovaries area. at first i thought it was just maybe a sore of some sort ..Like a pimple, on both sides, so i didn't really think to much of it but over time i noticed that it kept happening i noticed it maybe on three or four different occasions over a span of maybe 2 years, so maybe around the second or third time i noticed the blood (it wasn't much) i tried to see where it was coming from. im a bit overweight so i pulled back the roll of fat i noticed there was a hole ,,,like a small tubular hole, it wasn't a sore or pimple it was an opening on both sides right above my ovaries area. on another occasion i wouldn't even have noticed it but felt like a little bump there and it was itchy and a scab had formed and when i scratched it off i looked to see if it was the same thing and it was a hole a tubular hole a small opening like the size of a needle opening but it was a tube going in. that's not all, i woke up one morning after my commonlaw husband had gone to work and my body was so sore, and as i lay in bed i had little bits of like pictures of standing in a line with other people and there was a man about my age standing beside me with no clothes on and i noticed that i had no clothes on either. and these small beings maybe 4 feet in height were walking by in front of this line up ,,,,, like checking us out and talking to each other about us, and i don't know why but i jumped out on top of them and tried to beat them ... i guess. anyways i woke up and my body felt like it was in a train wreck. like i had been beaten. but i got up that day and has a hot bath and went for a drive... it was the middle of the afternoon on a sunny day and i found myself pulling in to a midas muffler place of business ...Im not sure why i stopped there but i went in and the guy that was working behind the desk looked like the guy that i remember standing next to me. this was a really weird meeting because he looked at me like he knew me and i said u look familiar and he said that i looked familiar too. and i didn't really know how to say it but i said did something weird happen to u last night,,,, imagine that... total strangers... and he looked at me kinda weird and he was trying to keep busy like he didn't want to know why i was there. and he said yes  ...And we both just kept looking at each other without knowing what to say so i said i can see ur busy can i get ur card and i left. after that i noticed blood on my underwear again and for some reason believe i have kids somewhere...Out there. and because i was so violent with them i may never get to see them. i just wish i could say sorry for attacking them . and i wonder if they did make kids from my ovaries, i would like to get hypnotized because i believe there is more to this that i cant recall or may have blocked,  crazy. i know but i haven't told anyone, but maybe someone has shared a similar recollection. ....It feels good just to be able to share this with someone .Thank

grandmother's room. i got up at dawn to go watch cartoons (actually watch the test pattern until cartoons came on). when i went out into the main living area of the house, i saw a \"being.\" the entity was dull or matte silver in color. it was standing about 30 feet away. it was about 4 foot tall. i estimated its height because it was standing in front of the refrigerator and was taller than i was in relation to the door of the refrigerator, but not as tall as a full grown person would be. when i saw it, it stood motionless. i could see it was wearing what looked like a suit, but the material did not appear to be cloth and did not wrinkle. it looked kind of like a robot, but without any eyes. anyway, after a very long and uncomfortable pause of us staring at one another, it lifted a hand up in the air. though i did not sense any malice, it's gesture did not make me feel comfortable and i immediately turned and ran back into my grandparent's room and hid between them. i did not leave the room until 3 or 4 hours after they got up. i completely missed all the cartoons that day (which was the only time in my life i ever missed saturday morning cartoons). i did have other odd experiences in that area, but i will file those separately hen i get some time. \r\n\r\nin direct relation to this story, i told no one of this incident until i was in my early 30s. my grandfather was a very no nonsense guy and i figured he'd think i was crazy if i told him i saw aliens in his house. when i finally got up the courage and told him about the incident, he listened very intently without comment. when i was done, he told me of an incident he had in the 1960's, in which he (and two logging crews) watched a 45 foot disk fly silently below them on a logging site for 15 minutes while they ate lunch at camp govey logging camp in the olympic mountains. he mentioned several other people that were present for that sighting, including my childhood baseball coach (jack mulligan of kamiah, id). i must admit, it was a shock to hear him talk so openly about ufos, as he was a devout catholic and aliens and christianity seemed incompatible to his worldviews and opinions.

immediately got my phone and started recording as i had seen something strange a few days prior to this incident. the light began moving towards us (moving west to east) the object made no sound, had no tail, and did not flicker. it moved at a very high rate of speed in a straight line, as it went over my house, it appeared to flash a brighter white, and then turned orange and quickly started

witnessed, constantly looking at the sky. after about 15 minutes, another white light turned on in the sky, behind it another, then another and another, they went on in consecutive order from east to west with a 1km spread between each one, each turning on only after the other, a total of 4 objects, stationary in the sky with no sound. the first displayed the same behaviour seen from the one 15

star in space ,only it starts to move straight and then zig zag thru stars as like to avoid them and as soon as im seeing this it feels like it knows i was watching it and then fades and blinks out in

to find it without a trained eye.\r\nthe ufos don't seem to like the fact i can easily spot them form such a distance using my lazer, its like im exposing them and there fling habits \r\n\r\ni am very

in a blink of an eye - zipped to the right and hovered for seconds or a minute then zipped back to where it was for seconds or a minute then zipped northeast in the blink of any eye and was gone.\r\n\r\nwhen it was gone i think we said \"did you see what i saw?\" i don't know how long all this took. my guess is 10-15 minutes but when we got to my sister's i think she said we were 45 minutes \"late\". for several days we could hardly believe it happened, but seeing it together made it real.\r\n\r\nthis was my one and only ufo experience. i did not tell anyone for many years. in the mid-90's when i did tell some people i was ridiculed and realized it would adversely affect my credibility, so i hardly told anyone else till now.  i was watching a ufo show and there was a story about people who had an experience and did not tell till now because of ridicule. what spurred me on was that the show said maybe someone else saw something that night. \r\n\r\nthis was not my friend's first experience. i think it was his third. he would be willing to tell you but he is in his 80's and does not use computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

it truly looked as though it was on fire, but then it began to dim down and started to look more like an artificial light. about what looked to be a mile or two above the horizon, the object stopped descending and began to perform multiple directional changes including both back and forth from east to west and straight up and down. at this point i was relieved that it no longer appeared to be a plane crashing, but i was still terrified because i knew it was a ufo. from the door i leaned my head in and yelled for my parents, waking them up, they came outside and got to witness at least 15 -
