of an aspirin held at arms length. it was high up, possibly 10 miles away. flashing/glittering.  upon first sight wondered if it were a star although i have never seen one \"twinkle\" in such a way with the naked eye. viewed through the binoculars it was very similar in appearance to the way a star looks through a telescope. except that i could see, very clearly, 4 points of light, triangular with a red light at the top, blue light in the center and two red lights at the base. there were multiple points of light coming off of it, like rays from a sun. it was not moving, at first, but staying still. there appeared, for a moment, to be a trail coming off it. moved downstairs to get a better view outdoors. as i descended the stairs, i could see it clearly through the stair case window. by the time i reached the back door, 5 seconds, it had disappeared. although it didn't move, n or s (left or right) it did get slightly smaller as if it were moving away. approximately 12 degrees off the horizon.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My one and only ufo sighting occurred in the middle 1970’s and was witnessed by two other people, my sister and a neighborhood friend. i have considered reporting this many times over the years and have finally decided to tell what happened in the hope that others may have seen the same objects and they will come forward as well. i wish to remain anonymous\r\nit was in late october, middle 1970’s, during the week of halloween. the three of us decided to go out play halloween jokes on our friends and neighbors. we had been running up and down the street, yelling, and having fun. when we got to the west end of the street which was quite a distance from the last streetlight. we then noticed a car coming into town on route 265 which runs parallel to the street we were on. playing as children do, we ran to hide from sight of the car driver. i ran out into the weeds near the edge of the creek and the others ran the opposite direction, back towards the street light and up into a yard above the street to hide in the bushes around a house. when the car had passed by i started walking back in the direction the other two had gone to hide. when i got under the streetlight i saw both of them standing on the hill above the road, pointing towards the light pole and moving backwards. i looked up at the pole and found i was standing under three, dull silver, discs that were hanging motionless about three feet above the light pole. the discs were all identical and had the look of brushed aluminum with a bright white light on the bottom. while the light was bright, it was not clear and resembled the look of a ceiling light with a frosted white shade, only brighter. they were ten to fifteen feet in diameter, somewhat curved on the bottom and around three to four feet thick from the bottom to the centerline of the disc. i could not see the top half as i was standing almost directly underneath them. i do remember hearing a buzzing sound but i’m not sure if it was coming from the streetlight, as many of those lights made a noise at that time, or if it was coming from the discs. i turned to look at my sister and our friend and they were standing some distance back on the hillside at a level that would have been about half the distance from the bottom of the discs to the ground. i turned my attention back to the discs and started to bend down to pick up a rock to throw at one of the discs. as i bent down i saw the disc on my right, which was the one farthest west, start to wobble and move slowly to the west. i backed away from them while watching the moving disc tip up and down like a boat does when riding moderate waves. this disc kept moving off slowly to the west and i watched it until it had traveled about one quarter mile then i looked back up at the other two. they had moved off to the south and were steadily moving up and away at about a 35 degree angle. my sister and our friend came down to the street and we watched them all move off until they were points of light that faded from view. we ran home to tell our parents and they really didn’t pay us much attention as we were out playing jokes when this happened and they thought we were joking with them.\r\nnever since have i seen airborne vehicle that resembled these three craft. i didn’t see any windows and i don’t recall seeing any seams, joints, rivets or indication of assembled panels. the color most resembled brushed aluminum. as i remember, i didn’t feel fear but just awe for what i was seeing. i believe my sister and friend were somewhat afraid but still amazed at the sight of these objects. \r\ni hadn’t seen my childhood friend for quite a few years then i saw him at a dinner and the first thing he asked was if i remembered the discs. we talked about our memories of them and we still recall the series of events in the same way. occasionally my sister and i talk about that experience as well. to this day i wish i would have hit one of those discs with that rock to see what reaction it might have had. if i ever have another opportunity i will do whatever i can to strike, shoot, or damage the object in the hope of invoking a reaction.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

dad and i suddenly had a thought (at the same time) to walk to the back spring and check the water - approximately 1000 feet from the farmhouse.\r\nwalking to the back spring i noticed yellow green lights forming lines across the ground in a non-distinct pattern. my dad did not want to pay attention to lines - he was focused on getting to the spring. it was coming on dusk now and lights seemed to grow brighter.\r\nthe field had recently been cut but i could not figure out the lines - they looked like laser beams laying on the ground.\r\nwe both arrived at the spring and i tried to get some water; when i looked up, dad was starring at the edge of the bush and there about 60 feet away were two sets of eyes that lite up from dad's flashlight. they stepped forward - i told dad that were aliens - for what ever reason he thought they were bears. they zapped us with a small wand that froze our muscles completely. i can remember saying to myself, \"concentrate, move your foot\", and i did - at which point i was zapped again.\r\non board their ship i awoke beside an alien who was surprised that i was not distressed at her appearance. i call this being a \"her\" - i do not know why - she was more grasshopper looking then then creatures on the ground - who looked more like the \"greys\". i had many questions for her and she was willing to answer all except one which to explain their propulsion system as she said i could not understand. i asked to stay onboard and travel with them - she was impressed (i think) by my lack of distress and my many questions - she took me to see another large grasshopper type and poised the same question about me staying on board. this is where they set me up in a test ( i did not know at the time) where they left me in a room, like a control room and i was told not to touch anything. i could not help myself - i tried to figure out the controls and started moving some of them - the large grasshopper came back in and was very upset - the her took back to another area where i passed my dad being operated on - i think this was another test because i lost it - i have more\r\nto tell, like why they are here, why they need us

16 of june of 2012 at 11:25pm,me and my wife were at bed but not sleeping, at bed since 5 minutes  and i saw a red ball flying outside by the window, i gone to the window and i saw only one red ball, i called my wife to come and when i came back, 8 more ufos where appeared, i started recording with my phone but the resolution was too bad, and we don t see clearly the balls but we can see it was red.\r\n it was cold so i was trembling so the videos not very good but my wife and i are comenting the ufos, and i could see that each one was about 150meters of diameter and were moving the same speed, silently and keeping the same espace between them. my wife was afraid, and me... not at all   but excited! we looked the ufo dispearing far away. i sent the video to the geipan the \"unexplained flying phenom group\" of france but they said it was asiatics lantern.... wrong!! they try to make us believe it s something normal from human... the flight last more than 12 miles so very long for asiatics lantern dont you think??\r\n\r\n\r\nlast year a ufo was flying above my home, and i thought maybe he can or not but i tried to contact him just thinking. i asked to him to make a big light after i count till 3, 1 2 3 and then he made a flash! i was so surprised, i decided to do it again.\r\n i asked to him if he could receive my message and if yes he had to make a new flash, and he did it!. i want you to know that till the moment i saw it coming from far away, he didn t do nothing specialn the light was always the same, a white ball in the sky, very high and without noise. \r\nbefore he desapear behind the top of the house i asked to fash again and guess what, he did it again.\r\n i know it seem like crazy but it s true. after this i decided to do it but with another way. i started to present me and say i m from earth planet, (always in my mind) i said if anyone space traveller come over my house, i would like he pass between a star i choosen and i, the same night 4 differents ufos coming from differents direction passed where i asked.\r\n i decided to change of star (the same night) and a new ufo coming from in front , far away comes in direction of the star i choosen. one he passed there, i asked to make a flash if he can receive my message  after 3, i started counting 1, 2, 3 and then he made the flash.\r\ni woke up my wife for she could see it, so she came at the window with me, and i showed her the direction where to look, i asked it to the ufo my wish, and then he flashed again before to disapear. my wife said i was crazy to do it . i don t know if i m crazy but i need to do it when i can. i did it about 10 or 15 times. i bought a pair of binoculars for spring, (weather will be better) we sleep under the roof, and we have windows on it so it s really big the sky, full of stars.  \r\ni hope you believe me, because, i m sure they are here.\r\n\r\nafter this, the next day i phoned to police and they told me nobody called to inform about this night.... and there was not asiatics lantern authorization for this night( here youan not let flying asiatic lantern without authrization)\r\n\r\npeople is afraid of the look of the others, not us because at this moment we were in this state snce a few months and so didnt know people..\r\n\r\ni hope you liked my adventures, hope to live more soon!\r\nwaiting for your reply or

2014 car races, i had occasion to walk away from the camp fire at around 10am to answer the call of nature. the night was clear and if i remember correctly the sky was relatively dark with many stars out , the view from my position on mount panorama is amazing with good views of the lights of bathurst to the north and the surrounding farmland to the west, north and east of the town. \r\nwhile answering the call and looking out to the west north west i saw an unusual light in the sky about 25deg above the horizon, on a closer look it was not one light but four balls of light or orbs close together almost touching in a perfect horizontal line. the orbs where some what in the distance possibly above the next row of hills across the valley maybe 4-5 km away, they where small but you could clearly make them out, two orbs where red and two where blue. at first glance i thought that it may have been a police light of sorts due to the colour however on closer inspection you could clearly see that the light where well above the distance hills and the most unusual thing was that they was perfectly still,i watched the lights for 4-5 min and they didn't appear to move at all, directly below the lights closer to me was a large gum tree that i was using as a reference point. looking at the lights i kept expecting them to move as that would explain them away as a helicopter or a balloon. \r\ni continued to look until my eyes hurt ,the light appeared to be fading and getting smaller, when i looked away for a moment and looked back the lights where gone.\r\nat no point did the lights or orbs blink like a aircrafts navigation lights also you could clearly see that the lights where balls of light not single points of light. the balls where not really glowing and emitting light like a light globe does they had a softer inner glow. i couldn't see any structure with the lights and a no point did the lights separate.\r\neven though there where thousands of people camped on the mountain no one i know saw or reported it or discussed it.\r\nat the time being newly interested in the concept of ufos and discussing them with a friend the previous night i was shaken with what i saw as i had lived under flight paths all my life and knew what aircraft at night look like, but actually seeing something i really couldn't explain away was a little confronting, i didn't even mention it to my friend who was still there with me for fear of him thinking i was making it up to back our discussion the previous night, it took months before i mentioned it to anyone. i have now only reported this after looking into the ufo subject and realising the importance of reporting these observations.

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"During the night 3-4 weeks previous to incident date at 4am i awoke to hear a very loud, low tone pulsating noice directly over my house the noise was off consitant strength on each pulse and as i woke up and it was directly over the objects on my bedside table were vibrating against the surface they are on and my window was also vibrating with the pulse. i lay and listened, i have worked as a boat engine mechanic and i knew that this noise was a propultion engine unlike any i have ever heard. i listened and tracked the noise of this pulsating to be able to estimate its location in the sky the noise would become louder and quiter again as it slowly combed my residential area in a grid like pattern (likely following the streets) it was moving only around 5mph and the pulses were around 2 seconds apart. after around 40 mins i heard the craft quickly getting louder and coming closer until the noise was directly overhead. petrified i used an advanced meditation technique to calm myself and drift into a dream. it was jsut an assumption but i felt the craft was scanning a grid of my area mapping it, once it had completed the area it returned to all points of interest while scanning. i believe i was a point of interest as i was awake and aware as it passed over. 4 weeks later (this is my report) i was in my lounge at 3-4am i was very awake and not tired as i had been working nightshifts in the week so my bodyclock was completely set to being awake at night. i heard the same pulsating engine noise approaching from the nw where my windows are placed. i could hear the craft was a long way out still very quiet, as it got closer is changed direction and started traveling north, i didnt see the craft as the way the houses are placed i can only see things overhead and within 200-300 metres infront. i turned all electricals and lights off and sat there waiting for it to return, around 40 mins later the craft approached head on from the nw again and flew directly over my house at treetop level, the craft had a higher wing section flat surface square underwing section that blocked the entire sky from my viewpoint, (i couldnt see the ends of either hosital edge so i estimate the wingspan to be around 400 metres hoszontally by 600-800 metteres nose to tail) the material was completely obsured as there were powerfull yellow and orange (spot lights similar to in a police helicopter) stratgeically placed in grid formations in 10 metre square areas, with much brighter spotlights every 50 meters squared at the corners. these more powerful lights cast a solid beam of light through the sky and were all moving indepandatly in a scanning searching motion (each seemed individually controled and were moving not in a sweeping motion but more like a fast human eye, locking in quickly to points of interest tracking that for a half second then jumping to another random point below and repeating. as the tail of the craft approached the was a porta cabin like room suspended below the craft aprox 30 meteres across 20 meters front to back, the entire front surface was windows with heavy dull blue metal victorian sash window looking frames, each crosssection of windowframe was covered in a thin layer of frost and ice similar to an extra cold bar tap, the glass of each window was yellow heavily translucent material almost opaque, it looked how a window of abandoned camper might look very grimey and dusty from the inside, each window that would appear head height if you were stood inside the (cockpit) were slightly clearer in a cirular motion (still dirty around the edges) as if someone from the inside had wiped the window, much like when a cars front window steams up. as this room was suspended below the wing and the wing was so low i estimate the bottom of this cockpit flew past barely missing scraping my roof by 10 metres. as i was in a second story room this cockpit flew right past me just overhead so i got a good look at it, the material in the glass and the metal used in the window payne are materials i have never seen in my adult life as an engineer. i suspect the frost on the metal window paynes is from the craft being at very high altitudes just previous and the thin layer of frost would melt over time as it is in this lower altitude, there was a small dim glow of light coming from the cockpit windows but as the material was quite thick and yellow like not much light was coming out, strangely though the exterior of the cockpit was very well lit from the amount of lights on the wing above. the whole thing looked like a victorian train cart with a giant carbon wing on top. i say victorian as the contruction seemed somewhat old fashioned. bordering on steampunk. later that night i went to sleep and awoke to find 3 entities and the rear of my bed. all 3 where wearing all black the one directly infront and to the left of them they were taller, around 6ft5 they where very slim and had hoods up that concealed their faces, i had left my windows open buy closed my curtains when i went to sleep, when i woke up my curtains were open and my windows were closed so i could see a little from the moonlight through the window. the 3rd entity was next to my bedside. as i awoke i had been proper up my pillows so i was sat upright, as i came too i knew something wasnt right, i couldn't move and the enitity to my right was holding my right arm at the wrist, leaning some weight on it with his right hand. the entity to my right holding my arm was smaller in height but very muscular and strong, i could feel the intence force he was putting on my wrist with little or no effort. his face was very close to mine and he dind't have a hood on, instead he had a black scrap of cloth like a bandanna tied across his mouth and nose like a surgeon would have. his face was undeniably an orc's face. very fat an muscular, big produded cheek muscles and cheek bones, he was wearing black leather gloves and an all black outfit with black leather breastplate with leather straps just like ancient samurais are portrayed wearing. there was a gap between his glove and sleve where i could see a very muscular dark green forearm, the face was also green with black hair similar to a human. as i woke up there were all very startled as if i shouldn't of been able to wake up. i tried with all of my might to come too and inflict feelings of anger and primal rage through my eyes as i looked the orc in the eye. he looked at the two tall beings at the end of my bed then reached into a bag behind him whilst still holding my wrist, as he was looking for something i was gaining in power and feeling more and more able to move, i felt like i was shaking of an anaesthetic, i started to raise my left hand to try and grab the orbs hand off my right. as i did one of the smaller entity becan to crawl towards me over my bed, whilst looking at that i sensed the orcs weight change on my right wrist, i looked to my right and he had a large syringe in my face, as i turned to him he squirted the entire syringe into my nose and i instantly became paralysed again, i remember looking at them and they started to dispear infron of my eyes, i started drifting unwillingly into a deep sleep, as i was drifting off i heard a conversation in an alien language i couldn't understand. i have alot of experience in the past meditation and lucid dreaming, i also have alot of experience with drug use in the past (nothing that could relapse something like this) so am very aaware of altered mind states and when i am and am not dreaming etc and when i am or am not been anaesthetised. the nearest drug i can compare the liquid they quirted in my nose is a pure form of valium or morphene.

occurrence i had a panic attack which gave me a premonition that the orbs are coming back (this is something that happens with me frequently).  but this time i had a strong feeling so i went outside and positioned one of my security cams pointing to the sky. the day of the sighting july 25,2015 my beautiful dog sasha, 11 years young,i, my mom & others loved her very much, began to act strange and restless. so this made me think something was possibly recorded, so i first checked the footage on the security camera around 3:00 pm. and saw the first 3 orbs in a small triangle shape which was recorded at 11:24 am and again twice more through the day when i saw more orbs. my mom and i were shocked at seeing these.I showed her a few days after as she's never seen them before, these orbs were moving slowly over petrolia with 1 of the orb`s fading out in the group of 3 just before going overhead,  the next 2 lights were going across my cam screen & 1 turned to the left at 14:30 pm hrs. the larger 3 orbs shaped like a uniform triangle was  recorded  around 18:02 hrs.Est and have no idea if there were more of these or not??? off my cam,\r\nat 7:30 am july 26, sasha came in my bedroom & woke me up, she was moving her paws all over and moaning. i noticed the swelling in her tummy and immediately i called my vet, i knew something was wrong & just after i started telling her these things, sasha got up on her front legs, cried & went back to floor, she said to bring her in to the animal hospital right away. she sadly passed away shortly before 10 am of a spleen hemorrhage. i feel that this was a very strange thing to have happened at the same time as the orbs. sasha had been with me during other strange sightings in forest ont., canada which i feel had an emotional impact on both of us.\r\n sasha & i saw a few of these in forest ont canada in 2008 & 9 like the first orbs seen in a photo a reporter from the forest standard published on july 10, 08   i noticed in the top of the photo a ball orb like the one i saw in a photo that i took in later july of 2008 at about 17:oo  hrs  est. pm. i noticed this dark orb thing up above the trees in forest & i asked  the photo tech what he thought it was. he checked it with a magnifying glass and said it's not a defect with the negative,or my professional film camera as he checked it too. so it definitely looks to be something taken in the photo a ball or something.  i still have these  pics. i received messages during  panic attacks in aug of o8. that there would be more sightings very soon. at the end of sept 2008 i was more paranoid walking my dog which continued to bother me. my doctor advised  me to take only short walks. on the 20 of oct 2008 i walking her close to my apt. around 22:30 pm when i sighted the orb. i saw this bright ball of fuzzy light coming from the other side of forest just over buildings and houses and i thought it was a plane or helicopter with a searchlight but as it was getting closer i noticed there was no sound or blinking lights, nothing just an orb, like a ball of cotton it was fuzzy around the edge. as we came to our apt,after sasha was finished her home work!!!, which was 20 steps up to second floor where my apt was this orb about the size of car tire hovered over the old 3 story royal bank building, up above an aerial on the roof we watched it for about 30 secs., then it just vanished. \r\n my next sighting was on jan 9, 2009 at 14:30 hrs est. sasha & i were having a great walk on the trail we loved and i let her run free after her ball and noticed a small blue, white,& yellow plane around 200 ft in front of us going over a farm field & this dark ball like object which i thought was a camera was in front of the plane, as it got closer i realized it wasn't. before the plane went over our heads the orb went around to the back of it. the plane made a sharp turn as if checking on the orb location, it was in front of sasha & me about 70 feet up and i feel it put us in a bubble like thing & we were lifted from the ground. i tried looking  at her, she was looking up tilting her head to one side, i was feeling this bubble was around us & i couldn't move my arms or legs or barely move my head & i was scared.  tried to speak to sasha she didn't even look at me & my voice was like rubberized or,,,,,we couldn't hear the birds sing or nothing, i felt we were in a time warp. i lost time on my watch & i don't remember what else happened but  do remember that the orb vanished and  the plane came back around. suddenly i found sasha and i were both laying on the ground, we got up and i noticed we both had dirt on us and started to walk home, which usually takes 5 -8 mins but this time it took us a long time like 20-30 mins. we were both like hypnotized or hung over or something. \r\nfuture attempts to walk in that area were not possible  because it caused great anxiety in both sasha and i.  i would throw her ball near the little bridge on the trail but she didn't want to go anywhere near it which she loved to do before this sighting.\r\nin february 28, 2009 at about 17:40 pm, i have a hard time  explaining this but i can say as sasha & i were sitting on the side of a hill watching the sunset, a bright transparent orb was coming across the farm field slowly & made a sharp l turn &  it started getting bigger as it was coming closer to us, i'm not sure what size it was  about 200 or so feet away, then it started disappearing slowly but i could see  the sun set through it so i can't explain that , sasha & i ran home as fast we could after the other occurrence had freaked us out.  we didn't see any more until the occurrences at the top of this letter, but i did see a ball of lightning in a thunder storm at the back of my apt in forest  2009 it lasted 6 seconds,i never seen one of these before ether.           \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
