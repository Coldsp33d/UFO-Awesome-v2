military service and ruled out anything we have witnessed of known aircraft , civilian or military. the actions and motions of theses sightings have been consistent until recently. they went from star like fast moving, hovering, gyrating to glowing orbs, to being able to see windows. recently myself and anther person witnessed a group of friends having a greenish beam or spot light put on them, they could see the craft but we could not. there was a light fog but the light projected was sharp and very clear around them. the one flashlight in the group was not capable of making that light source and did not make the light. it  has a halogen  bulb and was much bluer in color.Also the light source was not coming from the flashlight, but shining down on them  from above. we are no longer

immediately noticed a large number of amber lights in the sky south of us. i pulled out my phone, an iphone 6, and tried to capture video as we walked quickly down a 400 yard alley southbound. the lights were traveling in the same direction and didn't appear to change their position relative to each other as they moved east. i witnessed the famous phoenix lights in the late nineties and again in spring 2001, and these lights were the same color and seemed to be about the same altitude. this altitude i would guess is somewhere in the range of 800-1200 feet. they seem to be the same color as the amber colored lights that light freeways, but moving through the sky. as we watched and i kept trying to film them, they moved east and seemed to decrease in number, although i could not see any single light actually blink out. there was a bright moon in the eastern sky and some high thin clouds, and a slight breeze was blowing. as i watched they kept moving downrange toward the east until i could not see them anymore. i have combed the internet for any news and even called tempe police to ask if they had received any calls about the lights the preceding evening, but the dispatcher i spoke to, a female, said that she had been on shift the night before between 9 and 10 o'clock and had heard nothing about them. while filming i said out loud that since they were flying right over tempe, they would probably be all over the news and youtube. i called my 18 year old daughter and asked her if she had seen the lights a few minutes later. she stated via text that she had been driving and saw them, and had immediately thought of the movie darkest hour, which was strange because the same thing had run through my mind. when i asked her how many lights she had seen she said...I don't know. like a hundred or something. i will include my video file but it is in my opinion a very poor record of what happened. i am sending it in the hopes that it can be enhanced

of the area, and full moon when i first noticed it pop in. i immediately started taking pictures at first it was really low on the horizon, just over the trees much lower than the passenger planes we saw that night. i took a series of 10 second exposure shots, i wanted to show its movement. it took a few shots to get my tripod steady, even the slightest movement from the camera operations can be enough to make light trails. the light was stationary at first, the only reason it looks like it is moving in the first two photos is because of the camera's movements. it was quite bright early on. we believe it was over the sw end of a lake that is back behind the house. by then i had gotten my tripod steady, and self timer working correctly. it then moved left out of sight. two minutes later it appeared in a blink of an eye and started flying ne over the house. in the long exposure shot where you can see it turning i had the camera set to 30 seconds. so that is the distance it traveled in 30 seconds. i felt like it knew we were there, and i signaled it with a uv laser. we had multiple sightings of the same craft over a few days.  i could only upload so much so the rest can be given to the field investigator at a later time. \r\nin the first video we forgot the camera when we ran through the house, but in it you can see the craft after it's gone you can see a plane and clearly see

was drawn to the exact spot in the sky before it happened) i saw what initally stunned me and i split secondly wrote it off as a shooting star. but it was as though it slowed down time specifically so i could see it. im pretty sure it was only in the sky for at most 10 seconds it was extremely fast and almost fell ouf of the sky in a swooping down motion and abrubtly turned at a steep angle straight up and dissapeared. my boyfriend saw the last part when it changed direction and dissapeared so we know this is hard to disporove with modern science laws. and then there was the difference in the way time moved when i was watching it. it felt like i was being selected and time slowed down just for me so i was able to witness in slow motion the craft rotate to the side in a fluid motion so the bottom was facing me exactly and i could see the individually and eaually spaced lights which were white and pulsating in a pattern with a larger light directly in the center. i saw this for what must have been meerly a second but lasted for what felt like 2 minuets. i was stunned so much i couldnt speak or move to gesture towards it so my boyfriend could see (this felt like i was screaming inside \"are you seeing this!\" but nothing could come out) until it rotated back so the bottom was again parallel to the ground and in a split second changed direction at a 90 degree angle faceing up and dissapeared the last thing we saw was the direction shift and a brief trail of light in the direction it was going but it completely dissapered. i have never experianced anything like this in my life and i am an extremely logoical and scientific person. i am undoubtedly positive this was a ufo and it wanted me to see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was called new liskeard.  \r\n\r\nthis house is in the country surrounded by crops in the summer.  just two neighbours accross the road.\r\n\r\nvery late at night, before going to bed, i was looking at the window (facing south)  thinking that the neighbour on my right, accross the road, had great christmas lights when i saw, in the sky, a bright blue-green glowing orb coming from the west going east (from my right to my left).  at first, it was small but it grew bigger as it passed in front of the window than got smaller as it went slowly away.  it was going on a straight line meaning it wasn't going up nor down, just straight.  it was silent and somehow beautiful. a more or less 10 second experience .\r\n\r\nit's hard to tell how far from me it was but i would say maybe between 100 to 500 meters and on the horizon line.\r\n\r\ni didn't get scared.  i wasn't drunk or anything :)  i'm not the only one who saw it.  one of my haunt told me she saw it too while driving on the road on the quebec side.  but like me, she can't recall the year. \r\n\r\ni'm sure it wasn't an airplane, an helicopter or a meteor (wasn't falling, wasn't making sound, no bleeping lights, etc) or lightning.  by the way, this house is very far from an airport.\r\n\r\ni'm a serious person and have a good job, i don't talk about it a lot...\r\n\r\nit might be a coincidence but we had an eartquake on the morning of the first of january 2000 but like i said, i'm not sure of the date i saw the orb, it might be a different year but i'm sure it was either 1999 or 2000 christmas time.\r\n\r\ni'm aware it might not be an extraordinary testimony but you never know, it might be the piece that may complete a puzzle...  who knows? \r\n\r\nanyway, it felt nice to tell the story to some people who will take

observed a shooting star from the south to the north overhead on the rooftop of my building in downtown toronto.\r\n\r\n12:08am - for a distance that i would say is no more than 6-inches across the sky, tracking in a linear direction of a west to east direction but in the sky north of avenue and davenport rd rooftop location, we noticed a round, thick white light turning on and off to a rhythm of òonó for a count of 1 and 2 and, òoffó 3 and 4 and, òonó 5 and 6 and 7 and off 8 and 9 and for a total of 5 òonó lights all together. what is totally strange for me is that at 3 òonós  i flashed on my green starlight lazar and when i flashed it through the dark from 3 black 4 black and 5 it turned off but seemed to move faster for a moment and out of sight. the size of the light was bigger than a commercial jetõs frontal high beam light coming towards someone, yet was lit from underneath, not in the forward direction. also the light beneath it was somewhat subdued and not as bright as the planes in the distance flashing as they moved off in all directions. that it seemingly immediately reacted to my lazar when i flashed at it was outstanding.\r\n\r\n12:24am - travelling from nw towards the moon in a se direction (north of avenue and davenport again) was a cylinder shaped object tumbling or spinning in a clock-wise direction in almost a slow motion-like momentum, much like one would expect to see in space, yet close enough for us to see it with our naked eyes even though it was night, traveling within a halo of very soft, subtle and subdued light. the object seemed to be illumined with a subdued, washed-out amber and green light. it looked like the cylinder was a 4:1 ratio of length to width. in the sky it measured approximately 5mm and with the halo closer to 7mm in diameter. it was lower than the clouds but higher than the jets flying east, taking off from the airport. i pointed my green laser and could see the object get hit from the beam a number of times, much like i could see the lazar hit the side of a building in the distance with a focused dot. the cylinderõs surface seemed like it was a reflective surface judging by the green lazarõs clear visibility. the cylinder disappeared from view as it got closer to the full moonõs brightness. \r\n\r\nwe noticed both objects roughly in the same area of the sky, initially, though they traveled in different directions. \r\n\r\nit was a very electric energy that awakened and excited us. this is my 3rd unknown flying object sighting in a week and each time they were witnessed with the same friend. i wonder if she is the reason why because i have never had a sighting before this, except once, caught on camera in joshua tree ca in june and last summer in a ufo group meeting where some bright light seemed to descend towards the group and then take off quickly in another direction. the lights leave me curious but the cylinder shape tumbling and spinning is very exciting and highly strange. \r\n\r\ni am attaching some images i saw online to give an example of the cylinder proportion as well as the green subdued color from another online image. i didn't have a camera or phone with me, again!

(or lines).  this is the second time i've seen this type of object from my backyard during the early hours.
