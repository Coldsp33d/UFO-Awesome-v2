it was as long as at least 5 detached houses on their respective plots(across and not front to back). i half expect it was the length of half a football (soccer) field.\r\n\r\ni was shocked, and remember being completely spell bound, i wanted to get the neighbours attention, but remember i could not scream loud enough to be heard above the noise the craft was emitting. \r\n\r\ni remember trying to knock on peoples doors (who were right below the object), and think i did knock on one or two, but received no answer. i remember wondering and panicking as to why no one else was coming out to find out what was making the noise or causing everything to vibrate, and i remember thinking why no one else was in the streets just in pure shock, and i remember being worried that if i went any further to get peoples attention, it would be gone on return. \r\n\r\ni cannot seem to remember to well as to what i did after a few minutes of just staring up at it in disbelief, nothing seemed to be coming out of my mouth when i tried to shout for attention, i believe i ran to get my dad who was in a property not too far away, but it had gone by the time i got there, and do not know how it disapeared, as based on the size of the object i saw, you would see it from a mile away. this was not what your members have called orbs, but 5x larger than a b52 bomber. \r\n\r\ni knew i would question myself over the event one day, and therefore from the second i laid eyes on it, and told myself immediately after to simply always tell myself that \"i really did see this object in the sky just above these houses, and one day i would question if i really did see this craft - and in this case, this speech would be my proof\".\r\n\r\nit is now approximately 20 years on, and i am still telling myself this, but my memory has faded and i therefore want to record it while i can.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Insignia, Louvres, Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":89110,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.6441546,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-12262017-0006","longitude":-0.793403,"occurred":865170060000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1514281181000,"summary":"As long as entire road, deafening noise emitted, incredibly slow moving which defied gravity, close to homes beneath it.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":1514342451083,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"HP124YH","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7512,"locationName":"High Wycombe, England","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:4697"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"London","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was about 11:30 and i took my dog out into my backyard and i noticed something different about the stars. whenever i take my dog out i just about always look up to find the north star and the dippers. i noticed to the left in the sky there was a brighter star then the north star. the first 10 seconds i thought it was a satalite. i quickly realized that it wasn't a satalite because it stayed stationary like a star,was much too bright. it had a very slight pulse to it and the lights seemed to make a design similar to the shape of a decorative snowflake. after focusing on it i thought i saw 3 separate orbs in a triangular formation. i looked at it for about 10 minutes straight without diverting and it didn't move or change or do anything. it was cold so i went back inside.

walk from tipp city ohio to troy ohio. i took off walking on the train tracks with a couple of beers. i waited till i got far enough on the train tracks before i would open a beer as i was listening to music with my bluetooth head phones. this was appx. around late 7 early 8pm so it was cold dark and quiet night. as i walked about 15 to 20 min my cell died that i was listening to music off youtube bluetoothed to my headset. so at this time i was a little mad, had a long walk to troy with no music but i said oh well its okay i will just listen to the world which it was very quiet and cold. so i kept on walking occasionally looking behind me to make sure no trains was heading my way as i did while wearing my headset. so about 10 min after my cell died i see a bright white light just turn on in the sky to my upper left of me and then a seconed and a third bright white light appeared. the 3 lights all became one as they bonded together for about 5 seconds and went back out to how they first was. it stuck out to me cause it was dark and whatever it was was very close. i stopped walking and lit up a cigarette just looking up and observing these lights when all of a sudden i feel like im being almost stretched towards these lights in kinda like pictures being takin of me like flashes of bright white lights hitting me in face about every 3 seconds id say, and soon as that happened i was back on the train tracks. im still in same position looking at these lights then about 10 seconds they disappeared and next comes the very weird part i look back ahead to train tracks and started walking when all of a sudden im getting swooped from train tracks to my real body in a ditch. i wake up numb no feelings no pain just my face in gravel blood dripping from my face i look over to my right and i see my hand and im thinking whats going on. so i pass out and wake back up to people yelling and i say as loud as i can im over here with all my strength which was not loud at all, then i hear someone say i found him hes over here then a bunch of people pick me up and put me on a stretcher and wheeled me away to a very loud helicopter, well i passed out again for short amount of time and i awake to a guy next to me in the  care flight helicopter and i asked him what happened to me he said you was hit by a train and at the time i could not believe it and i still felt no pain but my arm felt weird. so i pass out again this time i am in the dayton hospital on critical injuries. the next day before i even had surgery i started to remember the lights and everything so i start telling the nurses and doctors what i remembered and they thought i tried to commit suicide. they must of been surprised to check my blood and had no drugs in my system or that much alcohol in me because i only had a slight buzz. i was in the hospital for 4 days ended up with broken arm in two or 3 places broken color bone punctured lung and fractures on c6 and c7 of my spine. i did not lose no limbs or anything crazy i was able to sign myself out and walk out by myself after 4 days but nonetheless i was feeling the pain everywhere but as of right now im basically back to normal. my last day in hospital bout the last hour or so im in the room by myself and the food tray card moves about 5 or 6 inches by its self and few seconds after that i heard an evil growl in the room with me. so this nurse guy comes in and im a lil scared at this point so i asked him if he could get me salt so he does and asks me what it was for and i asked him if he could sprinkle salt in each corner of my room and he did it without any questions and then i sprinkled some on my head and asked the lord to please protect me. its dec. 26 2017 now and im in better health and strength to write this crazy story that is 100 percent truth. i believe in the paranormal. iv seen 10 ufos in my life now but this story tops everything i have went through this is why i have to share it with everyone. i will no longer ever walk train tracks again or ever walk alone at night anymore. on a dark quiet train track away from anyone left myself vulnerable. they are watching and they are waiting. not sure what they did to me but i dont believe its my first abduction.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:25:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":89106,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.9583892,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12262017-0003","longitude":-84.17216379999999,"occurred":1512604800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

tunnels at the gaviota state park area when i said to my friend ( who i was speaking on the phone for the last 40 minutes) \"what is that!\".   i realized that there were very bright lights up in the sky moving around,( i told my friend, \"you don't believe what i just saw, something different in the sky).  i continued for another 20 seconds and then, i had to stop on the south part of the tunnels just after the curve, i stopped at the cliff and i realized that my radio ( satellite radio) stopped transmitting, so my call with my friend got disconnected ) \r\n\r\ni tried to take a picture and the light was so bright that was blinding me and i felt a little disoriented. \r\n\r\ni continued to watch these two objects:  there were both of undetermined shape to me, because by then, the sunset already has settled, so the only part that was visible was the front of the vehicles, like a rounded shape, the light emitted by these vehicles was very bright ( color was white platinum, grayish) it illuminated the pacific ocean underneath.The light hurt my brain, one of these objects was a bit smaller than the other. \r\nthey positioned themselves in various directions and they flew in figure eights up and down and other directions like \"interacting with each other\", in the interim, i observed  other flying objets around them but much, much, smaller like rods and tiny compare to the size of the other two (with respect of the smaller rod shaped objects, some were platinum silver color and the other ones orange).  no, going back to the two larger object emanating lights, at one point the larger ship positioned itself hovering \r\n( no noise) on top of the smaller one, \r\nthey were both separated with considerable distance, but hovering with no noise, then from the bottom of the smaller vessel there was a line of plasma or steam in a straight line that went all the way to the pacific ocean surface, ( like a column of water? steam? something!) and from the top of the small vessel there was another line of steam or \"energy\" with a bright light emaneting from it connecting directly to the bottom of the larger object. they stayed like this for a while.  \r\n\r\nafter that, they moved from this position and they interacted in different flying patterns until they disappeared in the horizon moving further west toward the direction of the  channel islands. ( not catalina,anacapa nor santa cruz islands, but the ones less known up north from those.\r\n\r\n40 minutes later, i arrived to my home in ventura county and i told my sons what had happened. \r\nlater that evening we heard all kinds of news about the well known vandenberg air force falcon4 spacex launched that evening. \r\n\r\nthis is what i don't understand:  i want to clarify that i  moved to the coast of ventura county in 2002, i am very familiar with the skys and the ocean in the area. i know about vandenberg and i have witnessed  the launch  of their products many times through the years.  what i saw on december 22 is not the same as other launches.\r\n\r\ntwo objects interacting with variable  patterns i just described is so different.  \r\n\r\ni also saw pics of the trajectory from phoenix az the local news channels posted on their broadcasts. \r\nnothing looked like my observation and pics. \r\n\r\ni would like to know what is your professional opinion.  in fact, these objects were interacting in figure eights and vertically, exchanging some type of energy or material, or water drawn form the ocean. \r\nthese objects were totally silent.  actually everything was crisp and strangely quiet.  \r\n\r\nwhen i arrived home, i had this headache and this mild very minimal disorientation, my son, watched the pictures i have taken on my cell phone, and that's when he realized that one of the pictures was a \"live\" pic on my iphone when i played it, we saw the millisecond video and how  basically i saw these events.  it did not capture everything, but enough to realize that nobody in the media showed these pictures.  i just don't know what happened to me, i remember searching for a good view angle, looking through the eye of the camera in my cell phone, but suddenly i feel that it's gotten darker alltogether and i did not recall having taking the picture that i discovered when i arrived at home. \r\ni remember that the light was so intense that was disorienting. again, i don't think i lost track of time, but still had a 'weird\" feeling about it. \r\n i remember that i was having problems with my iphone camera.It wouldn't focus or take the picture. \r\ni wish i could send you the \"live\" sequence, it's short but worth while seeing it. \r\n\r\nnote: please be aware that i have lived in the ventura and s. barbara counties throughout the last 17 of my life and i know the ins and outs of these counties. i am a connoisseur of the area., so things don't impress me as this event that i am trying to explain how could i have seen something so different than what the media is showing. \r\nthanks \r\nbest\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

 apparently not.  i was told to sit still.  i thought this strange, since it felt like my body weighed 5 times as much already.\r\n\r\nthe green glow disappeared, but i was directed to look in the rear view mirror.  i saw cars coming, but they all were turning down a side street, and it appeared like their headlights were dimming.  everything outside of a narrow circle in the center of field was black.  \r\n\r\nnext, all returned to normal.  i noticed a bright light about 1500 feet off to my right and about 300 feet high.  i was followed by the object at about 1000 feet off my right side even as the roads twisted.  i pulled off at the top of a hill and got out of the car.  the craft then went ahead of me and hovered about 2000 feet away adn 400 feet high over a drainage pond.  we stared at each other for a few minutes.  it then got a very bright white and immediately rose straight up, appearing as a tiny white dot against the star field.  \r\n\r\ni wanted to help them as long as they didn't hurt me.  i don't know if they read my thoughts, but indicated i would see them again, but not here.  i wasn't sure what that meant.\r\n\r\ni got home at 11:05 pm.  my parents were still up and asked me what was wrong, since i was white as a ghost.  i apologized for getting home late, but they weren't concerned, as they could trust me.  my dad asked for some help packing our planes for the next day.  he asked me what happened.  he suggested we call the airport (bradley field, now bradley international airport).  the first person i talked to at the control tower told me they had seen a fast-moving object on radar at that time and in my location.  he wanted to know if i had any additional information.  i told him i did.  another call came in, so he put me on hold.  a few moments later, another person picked up and said the first person was in error.  i asked to speak with the first person, but was told he just left, since his shift was over. (in the middle of my phone call?) i called the next day and was told the same story - the airport radar operator i spoke with originally was unavailable.  i was reminded that he saw nothing and was asked not to bother them anymore.  i decided they would be of no help.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":89087,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.9488878,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12252017-0009","longitude":-72.56063999999999,"occurred":132617700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1514205476000,"summary":"Telepathic communication, close contact with vehicle, green glow inside car","tags":["lights","contact"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1514340952646,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":9,"maxtempi":48,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":2,"meantempi":36,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":-5,"mintempi":23,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":9,"maxtempi":48,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":2,"meantempi":36,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":-5,"mintempi":23,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"06082","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":15990,"locationName":"Enfield, Connecticut","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:4717"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Brooklyn","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On my way to work and noticed heavy chemtrail in the morning about 9 am took a few quick shots of the trails , it wasn’t till later on when i was going threw the pics when i noticed the orb like light , does not look like glare nor does it look like artifacts .

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was working second shift as a field engineer at the shipyard and would get home between 11:30 and midnight.  i would listen to the richmond rock station at 102.1 mhz to relax (better music than the local stations) and sometimes a challenge to receive, since it was 80 miles away.  this night reception was excellent and it was 1:30 am before i knew it.  i told myself i would listen to one more song before going to bed.  about a minute later, i heard some static that is characteristic of weak signal fading on fm.  ok, so i would go to bed now.  i turned the stereo off and went down the hall to the master bedroom.  \r\n\r\nbefore i could turn on the room light, i noticed an orange glow, like a sodium vapor light, and some blue-green flashing lights out my back window.  i had window shades on all windows, since i needed near-dark to sleep during the day when i was on 3rd shift.  i approached the window to open the shade and get a better look.  my backyard adjoined a soybean field operated by the baptist retirement home that was on the next street over.  i knew they weren't out harvesting soybeans at 1:30 am.  a voice in the back of my head warned me not to open the shade.  i started to anyway, but was warned again.  the shades i bought had the edges curled in the 2 years since i had bought them, so i was able to see out a narrow slit.  in the orange glow, i saw a figure about 4 feet high.  it turned back towards the lights and disappeared out of my field of view.  i tried to move the shade, but my fingers and arm wouldn't respond.  \r\n\r\nthe lights got much fainter and disappeared, all within a few seconds.  then, i was able to open the shade.  i saw nothing.  suddenly i remembered the previous events of my life (enfield, ct 1966 and 1974).  again i asked them what was happening.  i asked if it really was them.  the answer i got was 'you will know soon'.\r\n\r\nthe following morning i immediately went to my backyard and looked for any indication of the previous evening's activity.  i saw nothing.  i was very disappointed, for at last i thought i had real evidence.\r\n\r\na few days later, i looked out the window and saw 3 rings touching each other.  they appeared to be perfect circles about 12 feet in diameter and from 4-6 inches in thickness and made of a grey-black powder.  \r\n\r\nmy next door neighbor, a retired air force officer was gardening out back.  i brought him a grass blade from the area.  he immediately identified the material as a fungus common to the area due to the high humidity.  he said the fungus typically starts as a small patch, then grows in random shapes outward, sometimes forming rings up to 2-3 feet over a period of several weeks.  i showed him the 3 perfect 12 foot circles that appeared overnight.  he had never seen anything like that.  \r\n\r\nhe then showed me several places where some of his azaleas were missing.  the dirt was still fresh, like they were pulled out by the roots.  there was a footprint about 5 or 6 inches long near the plants.  it looked like someone was wearing swimming fins with no obvious toe or heel marks.  he thought some kids stole the flowers at night.  he had several variety of azaleas, and it appeared that at least one of each color was missing.  \r\n\r\ni figured it would be little point in telling him what i saw a couple of days earlier, but i gave him a condensed version.  i said \"maybe aliens came from space, spread fungus spores in perfect rings in my backyard, then stole some of your azaleas, just for fun.\"  a look of shock came over his face, like i just revealed a state secret.  he was not amused by my whimsical explanation.  instead, he asked me to tell him if i ever saw any little kids messing around his backyard.  \"sure\" i said, \"i'll let you know.\"\r\n\r\nthe rings remained for weeks through several mowings.  this was my last encounter with the aliens.

and this was nothing like it. \r\n\r\nit's motion was very smooth and fluid like and changed from gold/yellowish light to a bright red and then moved straight down in a perfect line almost like it was

wondering where all the stars that used to be in the sky when i was little.  i glanced toward a star over my home and i saw two stars.  one was brighter than the other. i thought to myself why would the stars be that close to each other.  after saying that the one star was not as bright as the other suddenly started to move.  i watched as it moved from west to east over my head until it reached another star and became brighter.  once it became brighter it was over my neighbor's tree top in my neighbor's yard.  slowly it started to descend. the craft made no sound.  the only thing visible was the gleaming light.  the star as it descended looked so beautiful.  then it hovered over the tree.  i was about 30 ft away from the tree as it hovered above. i noticed the gleaming light was in front.  i stepped to the left to get a better look as to what was behind the light but all i saw was something dark.  i could not make out an actual shape  i was not afraid as a matter of fact i told the star craft it looked beautiful.  i felt like we were connected. i felt love emitting from it and from me.  i know this sounds a bit odd, but that was how i felt.  the craft was just hovering as if it was observing me as well as i was observing it.  i repeated again how beautiful it looked then the star craft started moving towards me.  i started to back up because i did not want to get under the craft.  it was not as big as i thought it was.  as i was backing up i thought i could go inside to get my camcorder to video tape it since it was moving slow.  as i backed up till i got closer to my side door i ran inside and ran back out in less than 30 seconds and it was gone.  i felt disappointed it was gone. i want to know why did i feel connected? why was it hovering over my house and why did it descend?
