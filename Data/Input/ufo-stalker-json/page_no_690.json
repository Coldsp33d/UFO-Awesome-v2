ago at same location with my son. but another appeared following the first then one after another . i moved to my left so i could start counting the number of them and see better to the ne,stopped counting at 15 thought it was over but then more poped up out of nowhere moving in the same ne direction. it looked like one of the last few was trying to catch up to one farther ahead. when it did it remained behind and to the left of it.All objects moved from the sw to nw at the same speed,like a privet jet.\r\n   all objects where red haze but could see little points of light within the haze. not one of them made any noise of any kind.Lost sight of them as they moved to the ne behind the trees.\r\n   thought it was an invasion and they where on a bombing run. they flu in no apparent formation but offset from one another side to side and behind one another.  \r\n   like i said i've seen the same objects 7-26,27-2015 an 0ne other that night that was directly over my head. it was a circle bright white light; thought it was space station but way to bright like a street lamp. as it moved straight up an away it got smaller and smaller til it disappeared. those red objects you could see 4 lights threw the red haze and they moved in a straight line accept the first one did a 90 degree move to its right twice as it was coming in my direction then stopped and hovered a minute and took off and up to its right over lake michigan an disappeared.The second followed the same path but when it took off i could follow the flight south over the lake,barely see it. it stopped at a very high altitude and started moving back towards land then i lost sight of it.My son has video on camera but poor quality.\r\n   still can't believe my eyes to see this many at one time moving across the

even with the telescope's finder. it was either very small or very far away. it was a round shaped object. the center was completely dark and the edges were visible too. around the object there were lights the formed a ring and around that ring there was another set of lights that formed another ring, however it was incomplete. only a half ring could be observed. at first i thought it was the reflection from the light of neighboring houses, but then one of my companions saw it too with his telescope. he described the lights as forming a three-point star outline rather than two rings. the object was moving very slow giving me enough time to change from one lens to another, something that is very hard to do when watching ordinary stars and planets. it was not moving in the direction of

and or taking off from hobby airport which is maybe 7 miles or so to the north east point to point i think.. \r\nalso worked at an aviation maintenance school for 15 years  (northrop rice aviation, westwood aviation institute, and aviation institute of maintenance, and am used to working around planes and seeing them up close and far away, what they sound like etc etc.. \r\nseeing the light,in the west moving east, i first thought it was a plane on a glide slope coming in for landing.. but it was moving very slow, maybe less than 100mph..\r\nhard to say for sure not being able to see any structure or able to make out altitude or distance.. i could just tell it was pretty high up.. and maybe at its closest within 5 miles as it passed by.. i heard no engine noise of any kind.. reciprocating or turboprop or jet.. \r\nthe color of the light was whitish yellowish.. sort of like a slightly dimmed halogen bulb.. but it was pretty bright still while it was coming towards me from the east it was fairly dim.. i was trying to determine if it was a plane or satellite as i did not see any marker lights.. after about a minute it began to brighten quite a bit, by maybe a magnitude or two, to about the brightness of venus.. had never seen a plane do this. because there was still no marker lights i began to believe this was a satellite as this was pretty typical for a satellite.. for the most part.. about two minutes into its eastward track it made a gradual northeasterly turn and then another turn to the north when it was almost to the northwest of our house.. it continued for a minute or so and then began to make another east north east turn gradually.. never appeared to change altitude at all. by this time it was probably in the vicinity of hobby airport (over it) and began to dim considerably.. it continued on this trek until i could no longer see it.. \r\nwhile i can probably rule out a satellite, i am not so sure i can rule out a plane or helicopter.. was just strange to not see them using marker lights in that airspace, plus not hearing any engine or air sounds.. \r\n\r\ni am used to seeing lights and sometimes get excited if i see something i cannot

because there was no point of reference and the event only lasted aprox. 15 seconds so it wasnt enough time to observe distance and size. nevertheless, 15 seconds is long enough to know what it is and what it isnt. the event ended by the object taking off in a flash and disappearing. i know it was an object and not just a light because once it took off its light went out and i had a partial glimpse of an object before disappearing upwards. i didnt recall hearing any sound though my fiancee says she heard something. it was a clear warm evening. the dynamics of this object not a natural phenomena and not of this world. 3 days later (the time it took me to process this in my head)  i decided to do a google search for ovni st. jérôme and it took me to a french website similar to this one and someone actually reported the same event only with more détails and even a video. this witness was a little farther away than me and more west therefore his viewing angle was different. the video shows a perfect circle whereas we viewed a distorted circle - though this person saw 3 separate appirations and only filmed one of them. we only saw 1 appiration - probably the final

license is not currently active. i stepped outside my front door at 11:30pm to have a cigarette. my vision is better than 20/20. my hearing is excellent. the sky was clear and it was very quiet with no discernible wind. i was facing north. within a minute of being outside i noticed what i first thought was a plane coming in my direction. by the time the object was directly over me i noticed that the bottom of the object was round shaped. the illuminated color was a solid orange-yellow. my estimate of it's altitude was 6-8000 feet. my estimate of it's speed was 3-400 kts. it was certainly moving faster than the 250 kt. speed restriction on planes flying below 10,000 ft. msl. as it passed over me i became acutely aware of trying to listen for any noise from the object, thinking it might be a jet. it emitted no noise. it continued in a straight path flying to the south. i lost sight of it through tall trees behind me. i turned back facing north and within 15 seconds of losing sight of the first object, i noticed another similar object following the first object's same flight path, at approximately the same altitude, speed, same size and same illuminated solid orange-yellow. again there was no noise. i lost sight of the second object the same way as i lost sight of the first one. neither object had any strobe lights which is a faa requirement for flying at night. their color was solid and bright. i've spent my life interested in aviation. i'm very familiar with all types of aircraft. the two objects i saw flying were unidentifiable. the propulsion system they used to fly at that speed did not emit any noise whatsoever.

lived about 20 to 30 feet near the ocean in arecibo, puerto rico in a wooden house. it was me, my brother, two sisters and my mother. the events occurred roughly around 1977 to 1978, don't recall the exact day or month, but it occurred during the night. i would experience this ball of light that would get smaller as it came closer to me, and i felt as if i couldn't breath and it used to paralyzed me, and  i couldn't even talk or move. i thought that it was just a recuring nightmare, and never said a word to anyone. fastforward to about 4 years ago, and we were telling family stories in my mothers home, when my mother started telling her story about the ball of light that used to come at night and as it came closer to her, she would experience the same thing that i did. then my siter said that it used to happen to her too. we found out that it happened to all of us, all five of us. then i knew that it couldn't had been nightmares that i used have, because 5 people can not have the same nightmares at the same time and place. my older sister then said that she witnessed shadow people standing by her bed, and that they used touch her in sick ways and used to laugh at her. my mother also said she had seen an uso come out the ocean at night, when she was looking out to the ocean around 2 to 3 am. i also keep waking up at 3:27am for some reason, it always happens. i am sensetive to light and like to always have the lights off. i was just a child back then, around 4 years old, but i have never forgotten that. after we moved from that house in 1980, none of my family ever expirience that again, but i have expiriced it, the last time was about 4 months ago. i did not see the ball of light, but expirimce sleep paralysis. my son was sleeping next to me and i could not move or talk, i kept trying to tell my son to help me, but couldn't speak or move, it was a scary experience, as is always has been. i want to know if mufon ever had cases like this one?  i would
