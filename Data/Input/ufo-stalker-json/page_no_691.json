yelling to another group of friends that where in a tent but they just laughed and shrugged it off. when my attention turned back to the craft, it seemed so high up in the sky. then instantly it was directly above me and 2 others, shinning a beam of light down directly at us. it couldn't have been more then 50'ft above us. we were mezmerized by the light, then all of a sudden it shut off. once the light shut off the craft took off, straight up, really high, and then slowly made it's way south untill it dissappear ed from sight. the funny thing was right after the light went out there was a short bald man standing right beside us. my eyes went wide as i looked at my friends in disbelief. he came out of no where. he asked us if we had any smoked salmon in a russian accent. turned out he was with another group camped there. it was all just so random though.  we thought he was beamed down or something, none of us saw him walk up, we were so transfixed with the light above us. anyway, i

unusual meteor event (about six objects traveling parallel). it was also the full moon, so we were observing the sky. noticed the object hovering. it seemed very bright, as if close and at a low altitude compared to aircraft frequently observed approaching lakefront airport (knew, i tried to call them). i a familiar with navigational lights as a frequent passenger in a former employer/pilots aircraft, and from general observation living near lakefront airport, and being on the north approach to fargo airport for 10 years. there were red lights port and starboard (wrong), a variable white/green light at top, and a white strobe. we sighted it twice above the tree line between 0 and 8 degrees north of our position, first at an angle of about 45 degrees, then at a lower angle just above the tree line. craft accelerated very rapidly from stationary hover in a northward direction. it returned above the tree line, hovered, then again proceeded north. on this second sighting, i observed it make a very abrupt 90 degree course change first left/west, then right/north, inconsistent with any aircraft i have observed.  based on the luminosity of the lights, i would have expected it to be closer than it probably was, close though to emit some engine noise, but neither my girlfriend or i heard anything although there was no interfering noise that would prevent us from hearing it. i am reporting this based on the atypical presentation of its lights, its sudden accelerations and stops, and particularly the abrupt change of course exhibited at the end of the sighting. this object would have been within the immediate airspace of lakefront airport, and visibility of the tower without doubt. i actually tried to call the listed number of the after-hours airport manager, but got voicemail with a full mailbox. there were two of us present who observed all of this except the abrupt course change, which the trees obscured from my girlfriends sight just as i lost sight of it.

circulo por trás de uma nuvpor trás de uma nuvem, perguntei para meu avô se existia mais de uma lua foi quando outros objetos apareceram e eram muitos uns 30 eu diria ficaram parados e depois de uns 20 minutos partiram em uma velocidade espantosa em formação um do lado do outro e outros atrás e dos lados.\r\ncaso 2\r\neu estava sozinho já era por volta de 17:00pm e meu avô tinha ido pra cidade que ficava a uns 10 km da fazenda, eu estava sentado em uma cadeira na varanda e foi quando passou por cima da casa da fazenda um objeto prateado voando baixo e só fazia um pequeno zumbido, posou a cerca de uns 200 metros em nossas terras fiquei muito curioso e fui ate ele para ver o que era tal objeto e quando cheguei no ponto onde ele desceu não havia nada lá.Procurei por cerca de 10 minutos verifiquei nas arvores e não o encontrei, voltei para o ponto inicial mas sempre olhando para trás a cada passo, senteime na cadeira da varanda sem tirar os olhos do local e foi quando ele surgiu novamente subiu até a altura de uma montanha e arrancou em uma velocidade fora dos padrões daqui da terra.\r\ncaso 3\r\nera dezembro e como era costume nos finais de anos os meus tios e tias viajavam de são paulo brasil para vizitar os meus avós e vieram em grupos primeiro minha tia magnolia, minha tia marliete 2 primos e 3 primas. durante a noite fomos convidados pra jantar na casa de um vizinho durante o percurso pelo caminho vi algo que parecia ser uma estrela muito brilhante e parei pra olhar foi quando em um movimento ela desceu era bem enorme e ficou perto de nossas cabeças, corremos pra casa do vizinho e lá já estavam todos chorando e orando dizendo que era um sinal do fim dos tempos. aquilo era enorme e mudava de cor pude ver que havia contornos como se fosse janelas ficou por cerca de 40 minutos ou mais até desaparecer.\r\ncaso 4\r\neu já estava morando aqui em são paulo era meados de 1997 e cursava teatro em uma tarde logo após chegar do trabalho tomei um banho deitei no sofá e decorava o texto de uma peca teatral,havia visita na sala onde eu estava no sofá e era muito converseiro tava difícil decorar o texto. de repente senti algo tocando meu abdômen e aquilo provocava um serto ardor olhei e vi uma criatura pequena com cerca de 1,20metros com as maos em meu abdômen fiquei paralisado queria gritar e não podia e a ardência aumentara a ponto de ficar insuportável vi que tinha olhos grandes contornos do nariz e boca parecia nevoa e ele me encarou saiu se movimentando rapidamente passou por entre as visitas e foi em direção a cozinha e sumiu, levantei me e perguntei pras visitas vocês viram?Deram uma gargalhada como se eu estivesse louco. deitei novamente no sofá e fiquei pensando e novamente senti aquela mesma sensação se repetiu tudo novamente e dessa vez ele foi em direção a cozinha passou por todos e entrou na parede pude ver pq dessa vez fui atrás e ele estava parado próximo da parede me encarou e entrou nela.\r\ncoloco me a inteira disposição para

nicaragua. on the last (4th) day we went to the volcano at masaya in nicaragua. volcano masaya is considered by the locals as one of the 7 doors to hell. there are 3 calderas, one active and 2 inactive. my son and i walked to the rim of one of the inactive calderas. he was taking pictures the whole time we were there. the camera he has is a nikon coolpix aw110. the camera is a hd camera with gps capabilities. the gps feature was turned on when the pictures were taken. the picture i'm submitting is a panoramic picture. he started from the right, pushed the start button and panned left to produce the picture. in the right 3rd of the picture, you can see the object. we (he) did not see the object until i started reviewing the pictures on the way back to costa rica. from the time the picture was taken till the time i spotted the object on the camera, the whole group never broke up. when i viewed the picture, i looked at my son and kiddingly said he took a picture of a ufo. he laughed till he saw the picture. we passed the camera around and everyone including the bus driver (11 people total) viewed the picture. since we stayed together as a group, everyone can verify the authenticity of the situation. when we arrived back to our place in costa rica, we viewed the picture on a non hd tv with a rca jack connection. we determined it was a bug or something uneventful because of the fuzziness of the picture. it was not till i returned home and hooked the camera up with a hd connection to a hd tv did i change my mind about it being a bug or something explainable. the object looks like one of the lifting body aircraft from 30 years ago but without the vertical rudders. i am a respected 58 year old department manager at a new car dealership and my son is a 19 year old eagle scout. i wish we had noticed the object while there, but my son's hand would have been in the way when he started taking the picture and i was 30 feet away from him looking in a different direction. the first picture is a picture of the tv screen with a close up of the object. the second picture is the actual panoramic picture and the third one is a panoramic picture of the whole area including the active caldera. i hope you can determine what the object is by these pictures and will be waiting to hear back from your group. \r\nthanks

with a possible test flight of an unknown type of air craft with the most likely point of origin being edwards air force base.\r\n\r\non july 31, 2015, two \"con-trails\" were observed to originate from the area of edwards air force base and return to that area. simply put, they did a \"u\" turn over the city of placentia, ca and returned in the direction of edwards air force base. \"to the north\".\r\n\r\nan important point is that civilian air craft, flying at cruising altitude, were consistently observed not to produce \"con-trails\" during the time frame before, during and after this event. in 40+ years of observing this air space, i have never seen one con trail come from the north, make a \"u\" turn and return to the north. the fact that two such \"con-trails\" occurred in a time frame that allowed both to be caught on video and still pictures in full and plain sight of incoming traffic to lax may be of some importance.\r\n\r\ni believe this to be more of a military test than anything else. this  maybe the precursor to a public announcement of a significant announcement of flight capability than anything else, but i also believe that this is what mufon was created to investigate.\r\n\r\ni must admit that i have seen some tv programs that speculate on the existence of the aurora program. please understand that a \"chain of pearls\" pattern was observed in the \"con trail\" only when the observed wind aloft was perpendicular (or approximated) to the travel of the craft. the prevailing high altitude winds were clearly flowing from south to north. the chain of pearls effect was witnessed when the craft was traveling west to east. to me this means that the effect could be produced by wind shear. on the other hand it could be produced by the propulsion system and that traveling directly into or away from the wind \"masks\" the nature of the propulsion system.    \r\n\r\ni do have some video on my cell phone and some still's. see some of the attached, the quality is not great. you have access to my phone if you want it.

started to fall like a leaf.  it would stop after falling and go back to bobbing in the sky.  after it had fallen, from my perspective like 2 inches.. it then hovered for a minute and then disappeared...  no flashing when it did dissappear, no trial showing the direction. it's like it went invisible cause it didn't reappear anywhere else in the sky.  while my viewing of the object

at approx 35,000 feet going 521 mph (ground speed). i was looking at our flight path on my phone and watching the terrain below. i have never in my life seen an alien or a ufo that i know of. they appeared to have light coming off them from every side and angle that they turned and moved- the color of gold as though the sun were reflecting off them. it was the middle of a very sunny day just over arizona maybe a couple hundred miles past sedona. me, the woman next to me and the little boy in front of me saw it... no one else said a thing. it was baffling, frightening in it's newness to my mind and incredibly beautiful. at first it appeared that they were traveling towards us and would possibly cross our path at an incredibly close angle (as in they were below us and appeared to be moving upward and then would cross our path in a t). i almost thought i was seeing missiles. they may have actually just been holding position... honestly until they turned and started moving in the opposite direction i couldn't tell if they were traveling or stationary. at that point there were three in a triangle formation and they held that position for several minutes and then began moving away from us. as they moved away they danced across the sky for over 10 minutes going in and out of formations and even at times disappearing down to 3-5 in number until at the last minute 8 of them appeared and spread out over approx a 1-4 mile radius in a straight line across the horizon. i think they were 5,000 to 10,000 feet below us. all but two disappeared and held a steady formation in the sky until i couldn't see them any more. that lasted at least 60 seconds to 120 seconds.\r\ni took a photo to document the area and the last two lights that were visible to my eyes but they are not visible in the cell phone picture from what i can tell upon trying to zoom in and see them. i'm including a photo of where we crossed over sedona, az so you can see region and then the desert picture was where i was seeing the ufos. i think the ufos were near the mojave. in that photo they were to the far right just where the mountains and horizon meet.","distance":"Over One

direction. some interacted with other star like objects flying around, some moved in between other star like objects as they went.. they would stop in a dime in mid flight after moving so fast. so we go back the following night just to make sure we saw what we saw and there it goes again happening already. so last night at 1 am we go out there but this time i brought my green laser and try to
