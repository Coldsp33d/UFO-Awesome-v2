outside for about a half hour, stargazing while my daughter swam, i saw a bright (and i mean bright) orange, pulsing light north-east of our home. i looked around at the other stars again and realized that this thing is not like the others. i thought maybe it was a nearby planet that came into view, tonight (july 31st, 2015) being a blue moon and all. i kept a close eye on it, the entire event lasted about 15 minutes. i noticed a plane in the sky flying over us, headed in the opposite direction of where this bright orange unidentified object was hovering. the plane looked as normal, red and blue flashing lights on the bottom with sound traveling just a few seconds behind it. i didn't hear anything from the ufo. i told my daughter to look, she saw it too. her first words were, \"mommy, that's not a plane, what is it?\" and of course i told her i thought it might be a planet because i didn't want to jump to conclusions. i lost sight momentarily when i looked at my daughter in the pool. when i looked back up it was no longer there. i asked her if she saw it move and she said she didn't. i continued to frantically try to find this object in the sky and i spotted it again about a minute later, slowly hovering toward the nw. there were no clouds last night that would have given this object any cover, the stars were bright, the sky was clear, and like i said, we'd been preparing for the blue moon that will occur tonight. i couldn't tell you exactly how far it went before disappearing as i was about a mile away (i assume) but after slowly heading nw, it picked up great speed very quickly and then vanished. i took my daughter into the house as soon as it disappeared and as we were walking through the backyard (which is fairly large, we live in a rural area) we heard what must have been every dog in the area barking. that's what really set it in stone for me that this had to have been an alien ufo encounter! my daughter felt scared at first but when she realized how excited i was about this possible encounter, she also became excited. i didn't notice anything after this, the time when we entered the house had to have been around 12 midnight.","distance":"501 Feet

over our heads just to the left of my vehicle.  i didn't know what it was.  i had never seen anything like it. the object was the shape of a \"remote control\" for a television.  it was gigantic.  along the rim of the object there were white and yellow/orange lights that alternated.  the object was appearing to come from within a dark cloud that had opened up like a doughnut.  i call it a cloud but it was much too dark to be any cloud i have ever seen.  it was if the object was coming through a worm hole.  i could only see half of the object but judging from the half i could see, i knew it's

in the passenger seat did not look towards the sky, he was busy fighting to keep the car on road by steering the wheel which i was ignoring (but pressing the gas firmly)  my other friend in the back

a large, heavy lift helicopter capable of carrying a small house.  in fact, i had the opportunity not long after the sighting to see one land on the quad at my college.  before i even knew it was there, i heard it fly over the building i was in.  the powerful engines and rotors shook the building so hard i thought the windows would break.  i went out front to watch the thing land about 100 yards from the entrance to the building.  i realized at that time that the craft i had seen near the interstate could not possibly have been a skycrane, because a skycrane has a definite, deafening sound, whereas the craft i had seen was completely silent.","distance":"501 Feet -

seats (in size) approaching from the north.  airplanes very rarely approach from that direction.  it was traveling due south.  the day was cloudless at the time. while observing the aircraft it made a very steep, hard 90 degree turn left (to the east).  it traveled east for a very short period of time then disappeared (vanished). additionally the sound of the engines ended at the same time.  there was no further sight or sound from the twin engine aircraft.  no other objects were visible at the time.  after this incident, there were no other aircraft visible as prior to the event.\r\n\r\nas a pilot myself, this strikes me as an evasive maneuver. the above check boxes pertain to the aircraft itself.\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

hollywood. it was in the evening. we arrived at approximately 6:00 pm and stayed until about 8:00 p.M. while walking home, as we both lived in the same general area, we were walking south on hollywood approaching poplar ave. i looked up and to my right just above the light poles saw, just across the street, this ufo. it took a moment for it to sink into my consciousness. during this interval my friend mike looked up and also saw it. we were extremely excited and continued viewing it as we walked toward poplar ave. the middle of the craft appeared as if it were made of a transparent glass like material and this area was a bright light which also had slanted black lines which moved in a counter clock wise direction inside the craft  and was visible. at times the lines would go slow and at other times they would speed up and become invisible. still at other times the lines would become viewable and vibrate, then the process would begin again. the craft was close enough that either of us could have picked up a rock and hit it. it moved slowly and without noise. there was no emission of fumes from the craft. it continued to approach the intersection of poplar ave. and hollywood until it came within approximately 130 ft and then it stopped in the air and maintained this position for about 5 minutes. then the vehicle accelerated towards overton park at a startling speed. it moved almost quicker than the eye could see or one could follow it. it appeared to be descending as it moved in this direction. we walked to the intersection and saw a memphis police car parked outside of a restaurant. we saw a middle aged officer leave the restaurant and approached him and told our tale. in a very excited manner, of course. at the end of our tale he asked to smell our breaths. he did smell our breaths and then told us to go home. when i returned to my house my parents were very upset as it was late and i told my parents and a brother and sister about the experience. of course, they thought we were crazy. as i was a young teenager i also thought it was my civic duty to report this event to the \"authorities\" which i did. i called the memphis airport and spoke with someone and was told there had been no unusual sightings. i am older now but have never forgotten this event. i am also retired from the memphis police department.","distance":"21-100

walking (and have tripped many a time as a result). i like to look at the stars and hope to see a satellite because they're so different from stars and planes. i definitely know the difference between stars, planes and satellites.\r\n\r\ni was walking the dog as usual this evening and saw a satellite. i hadn't seen one for several days so stopped to watch it. then i saw another. and another. and another. i started scanning the sky and kept seeing more and more. some were clearly closer than others with the furthest away not much larger than pinpricks. i was torn between running to tell my husband and wanting to see them before they disappeared. when i realized that they were continuing to come, all in the same trajectory from east to west, i decided to get my husband because he has an interest in such things. i ran to the house, threw the dog in, and told my husband and friend who was visiting to hurry up and come outside.\r\n\r\ntwo unrelated neighbors outside heard my cries and asked what was going on.  i told them and they followed me down the street to the open area where we could see between the trees. my husband and friend were also with me. it took my husband and friend

can't really say if they were in formation but they were definitely in lines and were in various sizes. i imagine the small ones were higher up. if satellites travelled in packs of 50 at a variety of elevations, i'd say that's what they were.\r\n\r\nmy feelings? awe and astonishment. i was a bit wrought up because my husband suggested a few times that i \"take it easy.\" i wasn't scared; just

did carry my dpms ar15 flat top with scope and 62gr m855 ammo for about a year in the back of my toyota 4 runner after seeing the craft/ship.\r\ni was coming home from houma, la, it was the last day of my 14 day hitch and about an 11 hour drive home. i usually try to leave around noon when leaving the houma yard to get home around midnight, stopping for a meal along the way.\r\ni remember being cut off by a driver while getting on to 287 from i-35 after exiting i-20 in fort worth, having to hit the brakes hard and swerve sending all my stuff in the passenger seat (phones, notebooks, bottled water) into the floorboard with all the empty wrappers and other trash from the drive. i have a blue tooth device on my visor so i didn’t need to retrieve my phone and didn’t think anyone would be calling on my work phone that late on the start of my days off so i left them in the floorboard.\r\ni got to springtown texas about 11:45 pm. no cars on the road and while stopped at the red light next to the 2 gas stations. the red light seemed like it was broken as it lasted a long time. there was a car at the station across the intersection and one to my left, no people outside. the usual several cars at the old station on the right.  i was thinking about running the light and was looking for the “cop” all the while thinking about what my wife was going to do to me that i hadn’t had done for 14 days. i had the windows down as it was a very nice night out. clear sky with a full moon, light breeze and in the lower 70’s. while at the light i noticed what appeared to be an airplane at my 10 o’clock way up in the sky over the gas station across the intersection. it turned to its left, got my attention as the lights shone brightly as it turned back towards the north east at a 45 degree angle or so it looked with me not paying that much attention to it but it looked like it accelerated. i didn’t know of any airports it could be going to as i assumed it to be a jet heading towards the dfw area before it turned around. that’s when i started noticing that maybe it hadn’t went back to the north east but down from its position in the sky as it was a light to the left of the road, i thought it could just be heading away from me but the light to the left of the road got brighter. the stop light had turned green and i was minding the speed limit but by the time i had gotten to the auto parts store i started thinking i was seeing a drug interdiction as the way it was moving “looked like” a helicopter hovering. i was expecting a search light to come on at anytime and as i got closer to the red light at the high school the light was stationary but my position to it was changing so the lights from what i assumed was a helicopter was above the street lamp and tree branch and was now below the lamp and even with the tree branch on the left hand side of the road. the moon was bright and you could start seeing an outline but there was no tail boom and the large lights down the sides and i was thinking it was a chinook rather that a huey or jet ranger. had to be a helicopter as it was hovering in the same spot for several minutes as the red light had caught me at the high school too. \r\n{i had been a correctional officer, a c.E.R.T member, a boy scout, rig operator in the oil field for years when the t-38’s from sheppard would buzz the pulling unit we had worked on in the 80’s, worked offshore and rode helicopters, worked as a management system auditor and rode in airplanes (747, airbus 300 and others). i can identify and tell the difference between alot of military aircraft from ww2 to present}\r\nas the light turned green and i moved forward getting closer i could see the craft to the left of the road at about 100 foot off the ground didn’t fit any aircraft i knew of. my brain was freaking out trying to fit this craft into a logical fit. i slowed down and pulled over, turned out my headlights and killed the car at the big old dead tree over the hill from the last light coming out of springtown heading toward jacksboro on 199. the full moon was high at my direct left and this craft was over the left side of the road at an angle. it was a little further than the house on the right side of the road next to the rental yard. seeing the outline from an angle underneath it had a y configuration to it. not wings at the rear but “winglet’s” is the best description i can give.  the craft was as big as an airbus 300 to its wings with the “fuselage” being cylinder like. i say that because it was not a round cylinder, it had a slight ridge running down the length of it. like when you cut a cylinder down the middle and put it back together, no longer perfectly round but close and having a ridge. the nose was hard to see well due to the light from the 4 large “windows” on the front but it was more rounded and blunt than an airbus. the rear tapered to a cone with the winglet’s running down the rear cone forming a y. the craft was about 150ft long and 35’ in diameter and making a low noise that rose and fell in rhythm.  there were 6 to 8 large “windows” down the right hand side of the “fuselage” that were the size of a door on an airbus, not the small windows. i tried to look into the “windows” but they had very bright light coming from it, you just could not see into the craft and i tried. i watched the shadow of the craft cross the road as it started moving slowly and go across the house and the field to the right. i watched it thru my sunroof to be able to estimate its size and the width of the shadow on the ground from the moon. the time showed 11:55 pm on my clock in my toyota which is usually 10 minutes fast. i couldn’t take my eyes off the craft while shouting “what is that!??!” as i was feeling around for my phone in the floor. then i remembered my .40 cal behind the seat. the craft was moving away from me slowly, crossing over the field and heading in the direction of the stadium behind me to my right passed the trees and back over the hill. i could hit it from where i was at but if i missed or it ricocheted it could hit a house or livestock. if i shot it i’d find out what it was one way or another but knew i couldn’t bring it down i’d have to wait for the news to report that an experimental aircraft or blimp had been shot or the completely other outcome, they return fire. \r\nthere were no rotors, no pylon motors no means to push or pull this craft thru the air that could be seen. it could have been some kind of blimp but it had no vertical stabilizers just the horizontal winglets at the rear of the fuselage and was running at night out in the country. it did had a red light on what looked like a pole coming up from the rear of the “cone” and what looked like structural “ribs” on the cone end of the fuselage. blimps have motors on pylons or pods giving it power, this had nothing and the full moon was shining on it real good. i thought about turning around and trying to cut it off on the road back from the red light towards the stadium. then the thought of my shell casings with my finger prints near a school…. not a good scenario, even if i had called the police. gun fire in the middle of the night, getting people to wake up and look. i do not know what it was that i saw but i can describe what i saw and know i saw it.  - a large aircraft “fuselage” with winglettes making a y configuration, hovering like a helicopter or blimp with no visible rotors or engines and of a design i had never seen before or since (as of 7/30/2015). \r\ni missed my opportunity because i was surprised by it. i waited and listened and read but i haven’t seen any word of any ufo in the area at the time. i gave a written report to one of those ufo web sites but no one contacted me or told me what i saw. i feel i was a coward at the time, scared when i saw something i’d never seen before. scared of the possibilities that could happen and no one knowing what might have happen to me. that cowardice subsided a few days after i got home and i loaded up my ar 15 with scope and green laser with several mags full of 62 gr m855 ammo. i carried this with me for the next year in the event i saw it again. next time i’ll find out what it is. i may not get to tell about it, but i will find out what it is or is not. if its military it deserves to get shot at because they should not be flying something like that close to populated areas where it could scare people and cause a wreck and if it’s a hoaxer flying a blimp at night designed to look like that to scare people……. what did they expect would happen sooner or later here in texas. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Appendage(s), Wings,
