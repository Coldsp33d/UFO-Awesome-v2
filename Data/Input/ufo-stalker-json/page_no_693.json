by its size and speed against the night sky. it moved at a relatively modest and consistent rate of speed from the south-southeast in a generally northerly direction until it disappeared from our view due to the tree line. the event lasted approximately one to two minutes. we also noted there was a strong electrical storm further southwest in the fayetteville, nc, area.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

even when i am in a dead sleep, they'll wake me up. last monday morning at 2:40am it was no exception waking up because the weather outside was changing along with being really noisy. i sat up on the edge of my bed for a minute with a pounding headache thinking about going to the kitchen to get an excedrin migraine pill. as i sat there looking out of my bedroom window before getting up, i noticed how weird and alive the sky was above as i looked out seeing continuous, and i mean continuous lightening flashes and thunder within one cloud above as i was watching. i was mesmerized by how it seemed to continue with the same intensity, one lightening flash after another, for almost 10 minutes without the cloud moving in any direction. the lightening never ceased or slowed which i thought was weird considering all the thunder storms i have seen all my life. i have never seen intensity as that was ever. i was about to get up when i noticed some flashes of lightening that appeared to be in front of and behind the corner of a triangle silhouette with in the cloud. it was very brief, maybe for 3 to 4 seconds, but the edge of what i saw was very hard and solidly defined about half ways into the object with the rest just fading into the cloud. i had no way to judge how high or big it was considering the continuing of the lightening flashes--maybe 5000 feet up--i don't know...  startled by what i saw i forgot about getting a pill for my pounding head but got up and went out onto my deck. i stood and watched the same cloud for the next half hour. it wasn't raining but there was a ton of energy in the night air. i thought about getting my camera but didn't think i could capture what was going on with the continuous lightening strikes in the cloud and maybe over exposing the picture. the only time i ever saw the silhouette image was when i was sitting on the edge of my bed looking thru the bedroom window. there is nothing inside the bedroom or even outside that would have given me this as being a false illusion. i considered that all the next day and saw nothing obvious that would twist or reflect what i saw thru the window earlier that morning. i thought about waking my wife so she could see this weird one cloud lightening within itself, but didn't realizing she had to get up in 2 hours to go to work. what was more weird after the half hour i stood on my deck watching this cloud, the lightening totally stopped and the cloud remained motionless with other clouds in the moon lit sky, like someone turned off a power switch.... after that i went back to bed not realizing my headache was gone till the next morning. i could draw a sketch of what i saw if needed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":68779,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.50645314592255,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07302015-0039","longitude":-96.77588062443056,"occurred":1437964800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"South

highly unusual. iõd be curious to know if anyone else has written in to you about this as well, confirming the highly strange characteristics of this sighting. \r\n\r\nbelow are 3 pictures attached to better illustrate the sighting:\r\n\r\n1. google maps image of the rooftop location where my friend and i were sitting, in yorkville area of toronto, very much in the center of the city, corner of avenue rd and davenport, facing the east initially, where we first noticed the unidentified aerial phenomenon. \r\n2. iphone 5s image of the direction the uap was first noticed. unfortunately, i did not have my phone with me at the initial moment of the sighting but went down to get it. once i returned it had already disappeared into an easterly direction, the same from where we first noticed it. \r\n3. image of an airplane passing overhead as a contrast-reference point. i am facing west in this photo and the plane is flying east. one can clearly see, even on the wide-angle lens of the iphone 5s, the flashing lights of the plane as well as the planeõs outline. i want to contrast the flashing red light brightness, color, and size of the planeõs lights to the lights we witnessed. \r\n\r\n1.\r\n2. \r\n3.\r\n \r\nat approximately 10:15pm sunday evening, july 26th my friend and i came up to my rooftop to have desert and watch the sky. as i sat down at the table placing the fruit bowl down, my friend was looking east and brought to my attention an unusually bright, red light. flying from the eastern sky from my rooftop in a northerly direction were 2 objects with very large red lights. what was different about these two objects were the lights, initially. there was only one color and one light on the flying object unlike the airplanes passing overhead, which at that time the sky was very busy with air traffic compared to most evenings.  \r\n\r\nthe red light was a much deeper, denser, fuller red than the airplanes passing by. it did not have a flash-like quality as iõd normally describe the airplane light flashing on and off, but was more like a slower turn-on, turn off characteristic to it, like a fade-up and down, rather than an abrupt flash on and off. \r\n\r\nat the distance from me the larger size red light was bigger than the largest star (jupiter), perhaps 4 to 6 times bigger than the plane lights overhead. the smaller red light was around the size of a planeõs flashing light but at that distance i would guess it is larger, but only slightly. i could not determine if it was attached to a solid object or if it was just light. my guess was that it may be attached to something but i could not see it at night, though the airplanes above the city can be seen unless they are extremely high. i also should comment that there was a lot of energy in the air, as if there was a lot going on energetically in the city at that time whereas when the lights disappeared into the eastern sky, the buzz and activity overhead quieted down to a normal sunday night feeling for 10:30pm. \r\n\r\nas seen in photo 3, i took a shot of a passing plane with red light flashing on its left wing. iõd describe this as a flash on and flash off, and very bright. bright because it seems like a white light beneath a red casing, like on a police car. the red of the 2 unknown lights didnõt have that quality. they were a much deeper, saturated red without white in the brightness of it. the plane in the photo overhead is low enough to see its wings as well, as it flies in an easterly direction over my rooftop, ascending as it flies east. my guess is that this plane is 2000 feet high.\r\n\r\nby contrast, the uap was first noticed in the eastern sky flying north. there were two of them. one was either smaller, just in front of the larger red light, or it was moving parallel to the larger red light but farther away in the distance, thus appearing smaller. the small red light on the first craft, which initially made me think it was a lot farther away, had a red light slightly larger than the one on the plane flying over my rooftop even though iõd guess it was flying 5000 feet high and many kilometers away. the larger red light, which flew slightly behind the first one, was perhaps the size of the 4 or more lights on the plane. maybe four or more lights together in size if we use the plane as a cross reference. the red color was slightly deeper, darker in color to the red arrow i have drawn on the photo. it was a red that was rich, deep, and somehow different to light on a plane, which always seem to have white as the base, no matter if red, blue, or green. no other flashing or pulsing color was visible, like on an airplane. one light, deep red, and with a slow on and off quality, not like the flashing quality of the airplanes. there were also a few moments where the on-off quality of the red light was irregular, as if disappearing altogether and then appearing on the same path in the sky but farther ahead. in the darkness of the evening and the distance from where i observed the lights, i could not determine if the lights were attached to a solid craft or not. \r\n\r\nas the two objects flew north, it looked like the smaller one continued north and the larger one turned left sharply towards the west. the curve in my arrow in picture 2 is close to where the object banked a strong left turn. the smaller red light in front seemed to continue north for a few seconds but it then disappeared from our vision. as the larger red light made its sharp turn, it sort of did a zig-zag move, or an òsó shape turn before continuing north of the city but in a westerly direction. also within seconds of that òsó shaped turn, i noticed a very bright white-blue flash in the sky in the north, not much more than 1/2 inch distance in the sky from the red light. it resembled a jet coming in for a landing with bright headlight on, but additionally, this bright flash seemed to me to be larger in an up/down size than wide, resembling a slit of some sort but it was extremely fast in its flash with no lingering quality. \r\n\r\nas the larger red light continued towards the west in the sky north of the city approximately under the big dipper now, we noticed that the little red light was there again, just slightly in front. we commented on how it could have reached and caught up to the large red light since they seemed to veer off in different directions at the point in photo 2 where the large red light made its turn from the northeast towards the west. the little red light just appeared. this time it was moving ever so slightly in front of the larger red light as they were now heading south but in the western sky from my rooftop vantage point, which for people from toronto would be in the direction of the international airport now. they were moving at a speed faster than the jets flying overhead, perhaps twice the speed as the jets were coming in and taking off from pearson international airport to the west of the city from my location. \r\n\r\nas the 2 red lights continued south they again banked left or towards the east, as if doing a large circle around the city perimeter. as we looked to the south sky as the small and large red lights made their way east, the angle or distance between the 2 red lights gave the appearance as if they were almost touching, with no space between them. at that point i ran downstairs for my iphone but when i came back up, they disappeared into the eastern sky where we first noticed them. i looked at my watch and it was 10:27pm. perhaps 5 to 7 minutes later than when we first saw them. \r\n\r\ni go up to my rooftop almost every evening to observe the sky, sometimes with my star chart to see where the different planets are or even the satellites passing overhead, which i have photographed on my iphone. in all the years i have been living here and observing the plane routes and stars overhead, i have never seen red lights of that kind on a craft before, ever. thus this report and the curiosity to know if other sightings from toronto were reported about 2 deep red lights circling the city from a 5 to 10 km radius of the center of the city where i was located. \r\n\r\nassuming toronto is roughly 25 miles in diameter the distance traveled would be a circle of the city = 157 miles.\r\nif 15 min. it would be 628 miles per hour.  \r\nif 10 min it would be 924 mph., which would have given off a sonic boom if it was a conventional aircraft.\r\nas it was closer to a 5 ð 7 minute sighting, that would make it between 1386 and 1617mph. i donõt believe it was that fast. perhaps the circle circumference was a tighter diameter.\r\n\r\nassuming a tighter diameter (20 miles) for the circle circumference = 125 miles a 15 min trip = 500 mph  \r\n10 min = 750 mph which is right around the speed of sound but still under.\r\nat 6 min and 20 mile diameter speed = 1250 mph\r\ni guessed the speed to be twice or more times the speed of the jets flying in all directions overhead. that said, judging distances at night by a light alone is a challenge. it could well have been much closer, like a 3 to 5 miles. very difficult to determine. \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

& sea, licensed faa aircraft mechanic, former faa air traffic controller tower trainee, did some aviation accident investigation for a worldwide insurer airclaims in hawaii and alaska, and have a bachelors degree in aviation administration from embry riddle aeronautical university-which included a course in flight physiology) and have been an avid amateur astronomer since childhood (having built and owned various telescopes, and taken several formal college level courses in the subject-including astro-photography).  \r\n\r\ni have most recently worked the last 23 years as an acute inpatient psychiatric rn at a major hospital in honolulu after getting my nursing degree.  i have also completed some graduate level education in nursing.\r\n\r\ni believe that i am somewhat familiar with aerial/astronomy objects and have been able to be clinical/objective in my appraisal of anything unusual that i might have seen, but this episode was different and unexplained.\r\n\r\non 7-29-15 at approximately 2020 i was walking towards my apartment on the 16th floor of my high rise condo and noted that the sky was partly cloud with cumulus clouds, the almost full moon was out, and a few stars visible. i then noted with my peripheral vision another bright object in the northern sky at about 70 degrees elevation. i assumed it was jupiter, being a yellow-white in color and bright, but this object being actually somewhere between jupiter and venus in magnitude.  then i realized that jupiter/venus had been in conjunction in the western sky lately and could not be the object. i am also familiar with the appearance of stars and other planets.\r\n\r\nthis was different, in that the object appeared as a steady light/orb and to my surprise was moving in a mostly linear/ballistic northerly direction with relation to the building overhang.  i cannot rule out that there might have been some slight wobble, but being familiar with autokinesis, i could not rule out this as the cause. i looked to see if the object had any lesser peripheral lighting such as aircraft position or anti-collision lights, but none were apparent. i thought it strange that if this was the landing light of an airplane that it is usually not visible at that angle when moving away. i could not tell the altitude of the object but it seemed as high as an aircraft might traverse or maybe even higher.  strangely no noise was noted, which would be usually heard from an aircraft/airliner.  it was visible while moving for perhaps 20 seconds before disappearing behind a cloud and not re-emerging on either side.  \r\n\r\ni also gave thought to maybe it was a weather balloon being illuminated at high altitude where the sun was still striking it since it was only 2020 and the sun sets later in summer, so i cannot rule this out. i do not know what the prevailing high altitude winds were at the time.  however, i do recall such objects and even satellites that i have seen in the past and they tend to oscillate in brightness as they move due to their changing irregular surfaces.\r\n\r\nthis is the first time that i have experienced something like this and believe that if others in the east oahu area of hawaii kai (city & county of honolulu) were looking in the same direction at the same time, they would have easily seen it.  i plan on calling the honolulu advertiser local newspaper in the am to see if others reported this.\r\n\r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

little higher than the car i was looking over at it and i was more mesmerised than anything else and i kept having to tell myself take a picture take a picture take a picture and it hovered about head high for a while and made a air hissing sound. it was football shaped actually but you could still see through it, it had kind of a pinkish aura around it.I kept wondering if it was a balloon or a ufo,i kept finding myself not taking pictures and just watching it and kept having to say take a picture and it eventually started to rise up and as it was rising in kind of a straight line heading towards sun which was showing through the clouds i tried to move a little closer and i dropped my phone and by the time i picked up my phone it was gone.Only the hissing sound could be heard and then it faded away and i just stood there kind of mesmerized wondering if i saw what i thought i saw, i finally sat down at home for about an hourand i decided i should report this so i started looking for someone to report it to not feeling anything just wishing i got more pictures of it or wish i had a movie camera but you get what you can get i just wanted to report it. thank you. i do have the pictures. the 1st pic shows nothing. the 2nd shows the light through my neighbors tinted car window. the 3rd shows the object above the roof.The 4th shows it rising away.","distance":"21-100

i saw it lower than the power line and higher than the telephone line in the pole in my back yard. so i estimate the elevation to be around 20 degrees at most. the speed was similar to the speed of a satellite. the elevation stayed the same all the time because i always saw it between the two wires. the trajectory was a strait line. it didn't make any sound. i stopped looking at it when it was too far away behind me. at the time of the sighting i thought the trajectory, elevation and brightness to be unusual for a satellite. i thought it coud not be a plane as the light was a single light and not blinking and there was no sound and by the size of the object, if it was a plane, it would have been near enough for me to hear it. it was a very warm night with no wind, no clouds. this sighting
