returning to the exact same spot . it repeated this move 3 times.\r\n\r\nafter the last trip, it flew over my house , then upward at an angle \r\n\r\nand just poof ,,it was just gone. my feelings?

hovering over my building, around 500 feet above my apartment to be exact. i emidiatly checked to make sure there was no reflection of anything in my car that would cause what i'm looking at. after a minute of not moving at all i was fixed on it. i stared it down hard to make sure it wasn't a balloon or chinese lamp or anything that would give me a movement of blowing in the wind. it stayed absolutely still and to my surprise the blue plasma looking ball shot north at a snap of a finger. i mean it went from stationary to faster than a bullet in a blink.....That's how fast. i seen the direction it went but it was so so fast it could not have been made by human intelligence. i looked and couldn't find if anyone else reported something similar but from what i seen, they probably left it alone but i have to say something as it has changed my life. what i saw was impossible. that object could have left la and reached new york in seconds maybe even a single minute. it was beautiful

and was trying to focus on it, wiped my eyes, to make sure they were clear, trying to make sense of it, even looked back at my house to see if something was shining though the doorway or window, and it just kind of disappeared, not all at once, but like how a vapor cloud de-materializes/evaporates. from time i first took notice of it, to time it was completely gone, was approx 5 full seconds. \r\ni stood there staring at the space that i had just walked through, thinking what the hell was that? \r\nthen i started to really look and break it down:\r\nit was in the middle of the yard. no trees, no furniture, no anything, just open space. \r\nthere are power lines along the back property line, 30 ft beyond where i saw this beam, for lack of better way to describe it - i dont want to call it a light, as it didn't  light up the space around it. \r\nit was not raining, so it couldnt have been a glare, \r\nthere are no lights on the back side of my house, nor do any lights from any of my neighbors reflect into my yard. \r\nalthough i had lights on inside my house, my windows have a brown tint to them and blinds were down & closed (horizontal), and the brightness does not reach that far into the yard. my back yard is very dark.  when i was trying to determine what it was i look across the lot behind me (apprx 120-'average size lot, a street, and across the property  on the other side. there was a street light visible there i focused on that i would use later to check myself. \r\n\r\nfeelings- no fear, just confusion as i tried to make sense of what i was looking at. very aware of my surroundings.\r\ni did not notice it as i returned to the house, but i wonder if maybe i did because i looked back so quickly, maybe something caught my eye? but for now i am just going to say no. \r\nmy dog was at the back door, she did not alert to anything. \r\n\r\nweather- overcast, no storm or lightening of any kind. \r\n\r\nmonday (following night) i checked my yard multiple times, looking for light sources etc. the neighbors were outside, and their lighting on their lanai did not reach much farther past the property line, due to trees/ shrubs, and their screened lania  the lighting on their patio is the normal white lighting. \r\n\r\ntuesday night i went out again, once around 930, and it appeared too light out yet, my yard was not as dark as it was sunday night. so i went back out at 1030 -11pm and my yard was now full dark, i could not see past 15 ft. same as sunday night. i stepped outside and looked around. i checked for the street light, same spot, no difference there,  i looked at my house, nothing reflective, same lights on inside, checked to make sure there was nothing that could cause a reflection on backside of lanai knee wall. i retraced my path that i had walked sunday night. i would have walked right to the right of what i had seen. repeated the same actions i took, looking back over my shoulder at the same spot...  there was nothing that could have created what i saw. . \r\nwhen sharing with a friend, she asked me if there was anything in the sky? how far up the light went, i did not look up into the sky, i was focused on the area right in front of me, its location. \r\n\r\nover a week has passed, and every night i go outside and look around. i reviewed the ground where i saw the beam, nothing different. i have walked out past my property line into the empty lot behind my house, and observed my house for lighting etc, nothing reflects against my house, i have no yard lights. i have researched this, i have emailed the state director, as well as other mufon field investigators. i am also a member of mufon.\r\ni am attaching a picture that i found online that closely resembles the shape, consistency,color, & fading of what i saw.  \r\nthe blue was darker, much denser- i could not see through it. \r\nafter 3 full seconds it appeared to just evaporate, losing its straight edges. what i saw was vertical, straight up and down. \r\n\r\ni do not know what i saw. i am reporting this should someone else have a similar experience. i tired to include as many details as i could.

three points of light which were white and steady existed at all three corners like a perfect pyramid facing south. the craft made no sound at all. it was much higher that conventional aircraft which make noise, have blinking aerial lights and move generally in an arc across the sky. this was steady and moved very fast. we noticed it when it was directly overhead at about a 90 degree angle. we followed it down to about 30 degrees above the horizon when it was lost in the trees from our point of view. it was not a satellite as it was not high enough for that, nor was it a conventional aircraft as it had none of the regular lights. it was very high above the ground and it was moving extremely fast to be covering great distances at the speed it was traveling. given its speed, and height i also must conclude that it was quite large (over 100 feet in diameter) to be a visible as it was.\r\n\r\nthere was very little directly south of our location in st. tammany parish. only the

clear starry sky over melbourne florida, the next city to my north. it is very common to see air traffic at all altitudes and in all directions. when the sky is clear as it was that night, i often also see satellites and meteors. i also want to preface my story with the fact that i have been in and around aircraft all my life and while i'm not a pilot i have been a student pilot and flown in many different types. i'm very familiar with most civilian and military aircraft characteristics as well as aerodynamics and even (to an extent) physics. \r\n\r\nover the city in front of me i saw a flash. the duration of the flash could probably be measured in milliseconds; it was very brief. for a moment i thought i'd seen a meteor because i wasn't looking directly at it. but then it flashed again in a different location roughly ten seconds later and got a better look. it seemed to have a diffuse glow around it, unlike the pinpoint collision lighting of typical aircraft in the area. this repeated a few more times and each time was in a different spot. i was unable to see it move from place to place between flashes and i found myself really wishing i had ir equipment. the flashing lasted about eight minutes. at no time was there any sound from it. \r\n\r\nthe following night at virtually the same time, i actually saw what appeared to be the same object come into the area and it was a spectacular arrival. it  would be difficult to estimate the speed except to say that it could easily have been over the gulf just a couple seconds earlier. it literally streaked in like a meteor. i want to be clear that i would not have seen it arrive except that it blinked as it did so, leaving a horizontal streak of perhaps 30 degrees (for a flash of such short duration to cover that much sky the speed would be phenomenal). then similar behavior from the previous night was repeated, i.E. a strobe in various locations, this time for about five minutes. \r\n\r\non a personal level, watching this thing was eerie. frankly it made the hair stand up on my arms and neck because i knew this was something extraordinary and apparently technological. \r\n ","distance":"Over One

 pelicans?? no, can't be. birds don't fly at night.\"\r\ni moved to the center of the field where it was darker to try for a better view, away from the streetlights that lined the edge of the block. i was standing in the field holding my forearm up in front of my eyes to block the glare from the streetlights so i could see the darker sky above my arm- i would do this when stargazing to see the stars closer to the horizon and removing the streetlights from my view. as these dark ovals moved in formation, like birds do, i realized the formation they were in was not the typical 'v' that large birds use. there were no large flapping wings on either side of these ovals and no head bobbing as pelicans do when they fly, and still too large to be canadian geese. again, i reassured myself that birds don't fly at night, and beside that, canadian geese are noisy, calling to each other as they fly. what i was seeing was now close enough to be heard, but all was very still and very silent. i didn't realize that the crickets and frogs had fallen silent til later. these weren't birds, so what were they? i saw that on their current trajectory they would pass directly over my head, so just watched and waited, curious to figure out just what this was. it was not like anything i had seen before. these dark ovals blotted out the stars behind them and as they closed in they covered up the streetlights too.\r\n\r\nsure enough they passed right over my head, giving me an excellent unencumbered view. as if in military aircraft formation, the first straight line was five vehicles wide, and directly behind those were three more ( i may be wrong about the numbers, could've been 6 & 4, i was in shock), in two tiers and deftly remaining equidistant as they flew slowly overhead. flying very low and too slow for planes- their speed could best be described as fast as a slow moving helicopter, but they were not helicopters and totally silent. they weren't in any hurry. the only sound i heard as they passed over head was a very slight 'woosh' of the disturbed air as they passed through it. no engine noise at all. they were the color of flat, dull black with no reflective properties, not even from the nearby streetlights, almost as if they were textured in some way or absorbing any light hitting them. not just ovals, they were an odd lozenge shape with the front edge positioned lower than the higher back edge. passing over my head from ene to wsw, diagonally over the town, passing over our two storey townhouse with maybe 20-25 ft to spare. they passed over smoothly, without any hesitation or course change, as if they did not notice me at all. i remember whispering to myself, \"holy f---!\" also knowing from a previous encounter i didn't talk about, i was sure no one would believe me if i did talk about it. surely no one would believe i'd had two sightings now! i could never have made this up, and it wasn't an area of interest for me. \r\n\r\nas i lit my cigarette now my hands were trembling. looked around for anyone else who might have seen this, but didn't see anyone. \r\nthis is when i became aware that the crickets & frogs were now louder than ever, not realizing til now that they had stopped making noise while the formation flew over. i went home and wrote down the date & time in a notebook, it was now 11:50pm. i toyed with the idea of calling the police, but figured they would think i was crazy- then wondered if i would lose my school bus driving job. people don't generally let crazy people drive their children around unsupervised, i thought. then it came to me that if they stayed on their current path they would fly very near the lethbridge airport, slightly south of the city- but would they appear on radar flying so low? i remembered going to the lethbridge air show that there was a canadian air force detachment right next to the airport, and tried to find a phone number, but of course it was unlisted. i decided to let it drop and not worry about it and keep my job.\r\n\r\ni was to have more strange prophetic dreams after that, about things there was no way i could know; quantum physics, a secret program i was unaware of, earthquakes, the frequency of earth rising, and many other strange things that i had no interest in. i had a bachelor of fine arts, so mathematics & physics are really not my 'thing', but i would go to my computer and google what i had dreamt about, hoping to put it out of my head- but each dream turned out to be something real and factual, which in turn would leave me a little freaked out each time. i never get used to it, the hair on the back of my neck stands up every time. \r\n\r\nboth sightings, 1997 & 2011, would leave me 'super charged' psychically and having prophetic dreams and then slowly over time it would slowly taper off again. i still have the odd dream that really stands out, but i still meet complete strangers and know things about them. i still know when something bad is going to happen, like earthquakes, but it feels more like listening to my natural instincts. i can sense when a spirit is in the room-but figured that this was from my near-death experience when i was sixteen. i had never linked my psychic experiences to these sightings until yesterday when i filled out my first mufon report about my 1997 sighting, when i saw page two with all those psychic questions. but thinking on it all last night, there is a certain coincidence. these two sightings seemed to boost my \"natural ability\" to sense more things, bigger events, that 'supercharge'. only once during the first sighting did i hear a voice in my head. and only two times since, once after each sighting, have i ever experienced what seemed to be clareaudience, being able to hear a \"voice\" inside my head that is not a thought of my own. in 1997, on a sunny fall afternoon i had a realization that the n pole was shifting toward n russia, and i said out loud to myself, \"the pole is going to shift, that's right isn't it?\" as if saying it out loud would somehow make the thought go away, or perhaps a spirit of some kind would validate it for me, but i heard a voice as if it was right inside my right ear say very loudly, and clearly, \"wendy!\" that scared the livin daylights out of me. i never doubted my ability when i get a very strong feeling anymore, i trust it. after that afternoon i predicted the next five 6.0 or higher earthquakes, seeing a map in my mind's eye with the epicenter marked clearly-five out of five correctly, blowing my own mind! (northridge and kobe, japan among them) i would report my earthquake predictions to a girlfriend, we would mark them on the calendar, then we would talk again when it actually occurred, verifying my predictions and giving me some idea how far in advance i was getting the information (anywhere from 3 months to 2 weeks prior). after kobe, japan, i turned my ability off, depressed that 2000 people had died and i knew it was going to happen two weeks before, and no one to tell, no one other than my girlfriend & mother to believe me, nothing i could do to save them. it felt more like a curse than a gift. the next time i heard a \"voice\" was after the second sighting, later on that fall in 2011- i was sitting on my front step on a lovely fall afternoon contemplating all the burdens and financial woes in my life, wondering in my thoughts when would things ever get easier, when things would ever get better for me, thinking only of myself, staring off in the distant sky- then i heard as clear as day in my head, \"what makes you think this life is all about you?\" as i snapped out of what seemed like a daydream, my eyes seemed like i was staring into the sun, but i hadn't, i was looking to the north (on my left) and the sun was on my right. strange occurrence! it also turned my ability back \"on\", beyond my control. after that day i became very depressed at the thought that no great thing might ever happen just for me, resigned that i was only here to help others. nowadays that's what i put my energy into and i'm very ok with it, which is a long way from where my mind was back then. \r\n\r\ni know this whole thing sounds beyond belief, i am aware how it sounds. as with my first sighting, i never discussed either sighting with anyone except my mother- til this report. it does feel good, like i'm getting something off my chest. although part of me is expecting ridicule from somewhere, after i hit 'enter'.","distance":"21-100

listening to the radio while unpacking at night, my radio started to malfunction.  as i turned towards the radio, i noticed a glowing light outside (i had no window curtains yet installed on the windows).  i put on my glasses, and walked towards the window.  the window was almost completely floor to ceiling, with a large picture window in the centre, and two large casement windows on each side that i could open.\r\n\r\ni saw a silver-coloured oval object appearing to rest on the rooftop of the smaller apartment building across the street.  this apartment building was perhaps 3-storeys tall.  the object was oval with a dome on top. there appeared to be opaque windows in the centre that were spinning.\r\n\r\nwithin seconds of standing at the window looking down on the object, it started to rise up to my window level in height and then move towards my window and hover over the road right in front of me.  it had blue/red lights underneath i think because these colours were near its bottom.  \r\n\r\ni was in shock and at the same time fascinated by what i was seeing.  the object had a smooth metallic surface, no rivets, bolts, screws or anything holding the metal together was visible.  it was silver/grey in colour, not dull but not shiny either.  the \"windows\" i call the row of white lights in the middle, under the dome were spinning.  i looked at the windows carefully and then i looked away to see if my eyes would be affected similar to when you look at a light bulb.  no affect on my eyes.  i tried to see if anyone was inside, even opening my casement window and looking out.  the window was opaque.  the object made absolutely no noise.  it was about 12 feet from me and large enough to stand up inside - perhaps 7-10' in height and 30' long.  i remember saying out loud, you are a beautiful machine.  \r\n\r\nall of a sudden i became frightened thinking it would take me away.  i closed the window and was kneeling down and continued to look out the window.  it was in no rush to leave and continued hovering in front of my window.  i remember saying out loud, \"do not take me please.  if you do, my fiancé and family will not know what happened to me.  who are you and why are you here?\"\r\n\r\nit continued to hover for another few minutes and then slowly moved away from my window, over kingston road, and gently and gracefully moved east.  \r\n\r\ni re-opened my window again and said out loud, \"be careful of the street-car lines\".  the craft was very close to the streetcar electrical wires and i was worried it was going to crash into the lines.  it was gently maneuvering around the electrical lines to my amazement.  \r\n\r\nthe total time i was seeing the object was perhaps 10 minutes.  i immediately called and woke up my mother who lived just east of me.  she went outside but did not see anything.  i then called my fiancé who did not believe me.  my mother later told my siblings and i faced some ridicule, especially from my brother so i decided not to officially report the event.  it has haunted me all these years and i have felt very guilty for not reporting the event because i know it was real and perhaps it could of helped someone else who had also seen the object verify their account.  after all these years, i am now reporting the event but do not want my name to be used please.","distance":"20 Feet or

28th, 2015 beginning at 4:30am mst.  i live in ontario, oregon.  my name is sorte` aura. i'm a female.  i have been a psychic since childhood and have seen many ufo's, but never captured any  video or photos of ufo's.\r\n\r\ni captured an orb/et with wings and antennas on my webcam video early this morning, on july 28th, 2015, while it was still dark outside. my webcam is sitting in my dining room window ceil and i have a webcam in my living room window ceil.\r\n\r\ni was asleep when this orb was captured on video.  i live by myself and no noise was in my apartment. it is very quiet at night in this neighborhood.  you can hear a pencil dropped outside at night.   i hear a binaural beat in the background of all of the videos.  i never heard anything at night with the audio turned on my webcam, except for this morning. we don't have crickets around here.\r\n\r\ni saw an orb flying past my dining room window a week ago on the webcam screen of my computer, and the motion detector on my webcam security software did not capture it, and no screenshot or video was recorded. when i looked out of the dining room window i saw nothing.  i can only see these orbs on the webcam screen.  so i decided to turn on 24 hour video recording on my security software, and turn on audio and lights on my webcam in the dining room window at night while i sleep.  \r\n\r\n\r\nattached is 4 short video clips of a close up picture of an orb who spreads its wings and its antennas.  it has rainbow colors on the edges.  it changes shapes. on the back of the orb was a red tail that only appeared in one part of the video and was wagging at warp speed.  i noticed when it was flying across the top of my dining room window, it became longer and its legs were hanging.  when landing on my dining room window screen, it changed shape and was smaller and legs were pulled inside of it, like a plane would pull up wheels after take off.\r\n\r\nthis is startling video footage.  this is the real thing. i never saw anything like it. i watched the video as the orb flew back and forth and across my dining room window.  i was in shock at what i saw.  i felt excitement and was starring at the video.  i played the video recordings over and over again.  then i said to myself, i need to report this now to someone important.  i walked in circles thinking about what i have on video. amazing footage.\r\n\r\ni decided to include the video clip captured at 6:12 am which is me reaching under the curtains and turning off the lights on the webcam. everyone can see the dining room window and screen (with spots on it), is the same in the daylight as it was when the orb was flying in front of it in the dark.\r\n\r\nnext, the orb stopped and sat on my window screen and posed for the webcam, then it flew so fast it looks like it disappeared into thin air.  last, it appeared at the top of the dining room window, looking down right at my webcam, and then the recording just stopped on its own, or the et turned off the recorder. my recording did not start again till daylight at 6:12 am. what was really creepy is that on the 6:12am video clip i still hear the binaural beats in the background, which made me think, \"is it still here and i just can't see it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\ni included photos of orbs and a cigar shaped ufo that was outside in front of my apartment, and was captured on my webcam a week ago, from my living room window. i was awake that night and when i saw these orbs on my webcam screen which was streaming at the time.  i looked out my front window and saw nothing.  i looked at my webcam screen again and saw the orbs, looked out the window again and saw nothing.  the same thing happened when i saw the cigar shaped ufo in the street in front of my apartment on the webcam screen.  i looked out the window and saw nothing, looked at the webcam screen and saw the ufo.  i was wide awake. i can see them on my webcam screen, but not directly looking at them with my own eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nthese videos are date and time stamped. i included the screenshots from my webcam in the living room window of 2 orbs.  one on my front lawn and one on the sidewalk in front of my apartment. my apartment is one floor. also, there are 2 screenshots of the same cigar shaped ufo that increased in size and changed shapes.  the ufo was captured from my webcam in my living room window ceil, on july 23rd, 2015.  the screenshots of the orbs captured by my webcam in living room window were taken on july 20th and 21st, 2015.","distance":"20 Feet or
