(brighter that all other stars). it started ascending slowly in an erratic manner (moving side to side), with the brightness of the object changing as it went (bright white). (pulsating). a few seconds later (~15-20 seconds) another bright star like ufo appeared, from the same spot in the sky as the first. the second also started acting in a similar manner, ascending, erratic movement, pulsating brightness. not even ~5-10 seconds later a third bright star like ufo appeared, again from the same spot in the sky & started behaving like the other two. i witnessed all three star like ufo's ascend upwards in the manner described above, for a couple minutes (~2 min). then all three ufo's became stationary in the sky (at the same time), & stabilized their brightness. at this point all three looked like stars. (same brightness as the other stars). although the first ufo that appeared was notably brighter, than the other two that were stationary below it in the sky.        \r\n\r\n\r\n(i initially thought (for the first 5 seconds) when observing the first ufo appear in the sky, that it was a commercial plane (with head lights on) that had turned toward me in the sky. but quickly realized, after witnessing it erratic movements that i was incorrect. needless to say this was affirmed after observing the other two ufo's appear from nowhere & perform the same movement/ pulsating actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nafter all three ufo's became stationary in the southern sky i decided to pull out my phone & take a picture (10:08 pm). (i was in awe when this was happening & taking a picture or video didn't even cross my mind)! i snapped a photo & 30 second video (which i have) but both didn't turn out.. just black, no stars or anything). quickly realizing my attempts of documentation we're useless, i decided to signal to them...\r\n\r\ni flashed my phone (i phone 5) flashlight at these now stationary ufo's twice & watched. not even a minute later (~30-45 seconds), i observed a fourth ufo appear in the southern sky from the same spot as the others. this one displayed the same movements & pulsating characteristics as the others. but this one flew almost right over me (slightly to my right, in the south western sky) & the most amazing thing proceeded to happen... \r\n\r\nthis fourth star like (round) ufo was much closer than the other three (within 1km, although it is hard to estimate). when it got almost right over me changed into an oval shape & flashed the brightest white light at me twice!! then disappeared!!!! ... i have no words to describe ... \r\n\r\nmy feelings we're that of goose bumps, awe, humbleness, warmth, friendship & love.. very strange, i find it hard to describe in words.\r\n\r\ni was brought to tears, which i can tell you doesn't happen often..\r\n\r\nanyways, i sat & watched the three stationary ufo's for almost two hours (until 11:45 pm), did not observe any other movements in them / or change in color.  nothing else unusual was observed in that time so i got in my car & went home, because i had work in the morning. \r\n\r\n\r\ni would just like to note

was looking at and the only things that i could justify claiming that it was had to be either lightning, a shooting star or a firework since it was only a few weeks after july 4, but a split second after i discovered the object, it shot off in a straight line to the east leaving a trail of light that was changing colors as well.  though i could not tell the size or altitude, it was obvious that the object was traveling faster than any plane or aircraft i have even experienced,   it was apparent that the object was separated from the trail even though the colors changed in the trail it left.  almost immediately after this happened, the light and its trail of light disappeared.  i felt like the object knew that i had spotted it and therefore took off as quickly as it could.  i also considered that it was phasing in and out of high speed travel.  as mentioned before, it was hard to determine the altitude, but it was too high to be a firework and i feel that it's fair to say it wasn't lightning because of the nature of its beeline flight path.  this leaves the possibility of a shooting star, but it too large in my opinion and i was in an urban area that caused enough light pollution that you had a hard time making out the brightest stars. i have seen shooting stars before, but it didn't feel the same and the object did fly in a straight line, i have yet to see a shooting star that doesn't have some curve in it's flight path.  there wasn't any sound coming from the object or afterwards which helps to debunk the possibility of it being a firework or lightning   to my dismay, i discovered that i was the only one that saw the object at the party.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

light high in the sky moving in a north easterly direction. my initial thought maybe satelite, or possibly the international space station.\r\n\r\n  after a few moments the light brightened, i looked for aircraft navigation lights, there were none. the light seemed to fall from the sky, a moment later a huge pulsing pure white `not a reflective light`, it looked like a\r\n\"blob\" or a \"splat\" was above me i had felt a pressure change i remember taking an intake of breath, i was fixed to the spot trying to take in what i was witnessing,then a large orb slowly ejected from the object accended vertically above getting smaller to its zenith and started dancing about high in the sky. i noticed a very pale yellow haze around me, moments later the main object started to dim, until this moment i did not see a solid craft what i did see was, what i thought looked like the top of the eifel tower,a solid airial perhaps, definatley solid and looked metallic.\r\n the main object blinked out, the small orb was still high in the sky, i saw another light i believe was the main object connect to the the small orb then move off to the north east for a few seconds then blinked out.\r\n\r\n  the night of the 22/07/2015, was clear starlit, no cloud.\r\n\r\n  during the sighting i felt totally calm, even recall a smile on my face,i do recall being fixed to the spot my arms down by my side no fear totally calm however when sighting was over, i felt vunerable an fearfull, i looked at my watch it was 0210, i felt i had to get away i packed my gear and left.\r\n\r\n  i had been on the

 do you mate with each outher.  i replied we are not from here. we are hoping to find females. we come from ontario. we were taken somehow to an inspection area and placed on a table. there were lots of tables there with teens on them. we were examined by much taller 5 or 6 foot greys with almond shaped eyes and big heads.    the next thing i knew we were back in my car and the sun was comming up. it was saturday morning. rick asked what happened to us?

1999 and to the south i saw three black military looking helicopters flying north, just above the tree tops following the nearby highway 97. later that same afternoon, still working on my roof i saw one of the black helicopters return, flying low almost directly over my house, seeming to me at the time to be getting a better look at what i was doing on the roof, then after passing over my house the helicopter changed direction and flew off to the north. later that night at about 3-4 am i awoke to use the washroom. when i returned to my bedroom i saw a moving light out my bedroom window and it caught my attention. i went up to the window which faces almost due north and noticed other lights in a place in the sky i know were not stars. as i watched i noticed 2 stationary lights (i beleive to be helicopters) one at a lower altitude and the other in line at a higher altitude, and a third moving light/helicopter farther to the east. as i watched i realized that a fourth light, between the first two stationary lights and the moving light. doing the same maneuvers as the light that was moving further to the east was doing. i took note of this because the third and fourth lights never went higher(ascend) or lower (decend) than the first two stationary lights. as i watched i noticed that the fourth light was doing the same movements as the third light but at a way faster speed. i noticed that the third light moved as i know a helicopter would move, then when it finished moving the fourth light would do the same movement or pattern as the third light did but it moved unimaginably fast. the third light (which i believe to be a helicopter) would move in many different ways like ascending,descending, form a figure 8 or a z etc. never going higher or lower then the two stationary lights to the west at different altitudes. and the fourth light would mimic the movements of the moving light but it was moving at a speed and changing directions that no helicopter could ever do. i belive what i was watching was two stationary helicopters at different altitudes and a third, moving helicopter, and some kind of experimental or other worldly aircraft that was being tested. i watched these lights for 15-20 minutes and then returned to my bed to sleep. being that the event happened so long ago i do not remember the exact month or day but i'm sure it was 1999. i will remember this sighting for the rest of my life.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering
