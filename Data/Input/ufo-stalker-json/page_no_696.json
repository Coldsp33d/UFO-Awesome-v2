(it is a fairly busy route so pulling over quickly was dangerous yet i still felt the need to veer on to the side of the road).  i have witnessed these orbs 3 times in my life before this event and tired of everyone calling me crazy, i needed to get a photo or video for the non-believers.  as i darted out of my car i took my cell phone and proceeded to try and video the orbs.  my phone seemed to be stalling/loading for a period of time that is not normal.  i bought the phone 4 months ago and it has always ran very smoothly.  sure enough, the camera app opens and seconds before i am able to push the capture button, the two orbs went off.  off but no away.  while looking through my phones camera i was not able to see any objects because it was already pretty dark out.  as i looked up (normal vision, not through camera) i noticed i could still see two objects in the sky just sitting there.  i stared at these objects for a least another 2 minutes hoping they may light up again.  this did not happen.  i decided that i would leave because i was on the side of the highway and these objects were not making themselves visible again.  when i got to work i noticed my watch had randomly stopped as well right at 9:02pm.  battery completely dead.\r\nlike i said this is the third time this has happened to me in my life and i have been aggressively educating myself on all unexplained occurrences.\r\n\r\nthis is more or less too see if anyone else out there happened to see what i saw.  it will make me feel alot less crazy if i had some actual evidence to back up my claims.

oklahoma just off of highway 76 out in the country not many houses more land than anything my grandmother's house has a long driveway from a country road leading up to the house lots of trees and some big open areas in land anyways after eating talking playing etc it was approximately 9:45pm and me and my cousin decided to go outside and walk to the pond right before turning into the driveway we let everyone know what we were doing and walk out the back door walking toward the front to go to the pond we get to the place were we parked the cars approximately 100ft from back door and we both start to feel vibration in our body's but didn't think to much of it we walk maybe 15 more feet and we completely i guess go blind we both see nothing but black we back up and we can see normal again it was dark outside but not pitch black you could still see some we look at each other say that's weird and blow it off and keep walking 5 to 10 more feet it goes pitch black once more and we hear a super fast swoosh noise of something moving at super fast speeds after hearing that we can see again and there is a huge disc shaped craft it was black with like a chromed finish and i want to say windows around it with every color you could think of coming from inside the craft moving from north ne to the right of us we were walking east it hovered approximately 15 feet away tree higth for 30 seconds then descended to an open area of trees landing, at this point we are extremely terrified we couldn't move we felt locked in place and having our thoughts scanned a door opened up poping out from top and periodically turning inside itself until it touched the ground 3 beings with big heads huge eyes it looked like what most people call greys stepped out and walked up to me the next thing i know i'm inside the craft on a table with the 3 beings looking at me there was a human looking being standing to the right side not sure if it was human or not the walls looked metallic but also looked like if you touched them u would fall threw there wasn't much in the room besides a i want to say a bath tub looking thing with black goo looking stuff in it,while i'm lying on the table the 3 \"greys\" stare at me getting inches from my face and i black out the next thing i know i'm looking up at the sky at it hovering tree higth like i went back in time or something and was extremely scared and me and my cousin ran frantically back to the back door running in the house this took to what we thought 1 minute to a minute and a half as we ran in our family members were worried asking us were we have been saying they was looking for us for an hour and a half i had scars on me and was bleeding down my arm and my head my cousin had bruses and was bleeding on his knee,we never told them what we encountered. ive had several incounters after this experience the last one happed one day ago 7/26/15 witch was the most moving to me i guess you could say and i need some support or help this is really making me feel out of place here on earth. i would like to tell my other encounters but i need reassurance that this isn't going to cause me to lose my life.","distance":"20 Feet or

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"There is so much to tell, i still can't make any sense of any of it. i guess it first began with the ufo i saw, when i was staying on a property, sort of overlooking things as the land was being developed for track homes that were to be built. it was early spring in 2001, around 8:30 p.M. really not much to do, middle of no where, far from any stores or other houses, or people, really, just my ex boyfriend, myself and our kids, he was on his c.B. radio, kids were asleep, i was doing a property check, walking the property and the long driveway that lead up to the house we stayed in. after my check, i sat on the porch, it was warm, and the night was peaceful. it was then that i noticed a light coming from the end of the drive, i thought that it may have been head lights, but the lights were just something, seemed off,i watched for a while then i decided to walk down for a better look, just then it came closer and i could see that it was a circular object with lights just below the tree line and close enough to understand that it was hovering, it seemed like it, it saw me too, so i began to try to communicate with it, using very simple gestures, gestures like extending my arm and then bending it back  towards me , i did this for awhile then for some reason decided to flick a lighter, when i did this it came closer, and i would beckon it and wait and then second time i flicked my liter, it responded by making its lights brighter, and it went on like this for i dont know how long, then i guess it grew bored or tired of our game that it changed its path, and in no rush slowly went back the drive towards the street then entered the street and it was gone. want another one? okay months later maybe a year later, back living in glendora, my ex just left for work around 3:30 a.M. i got up to use the bathroom, and as i opened the door to go back to bed,at the same time, this, . . thing, creature, came out of my bedroom, the bathroom is directly across from my bed room door, we both froze locked eyes, now let me paint an mental image of this, this thing was the size of one of the small mexican ankle biters, those little dogs, chee-wa-wa , anyway, totally black, it had what looked like as i can discribe as,looked like ,ok you what our hair folicals look like, like that but big, all over if i could draw it for you you'd understand what it looked like better, but it had these red eyes, i mean led red eyes just glowing at me, we both froze, but when i moved to take a step it about faced and flew!!! in a hot second flew back into my room, i ran in right behind it, and i saw it fly into my closet, and as it went i noticed a green, lime green light glow filled the room and in it went and the green light went with it. okay, now this is the freaky part, i was a step or 2 behind it so when it trapped itself in there, i planted myself on my bed grabbed a baseball bat that was within reach and waited for it to show it self, but get this,it no longer had the same physic, as it just had a second ago, it was in my closet, i could see it was moving the clothes on the hangers, toppling over shoes boxes,i could hear it rustling thru the boxes, papers coats and whatever but i was only seeing a faint green glow bouncing in there knocking thing around,then i got a clear look, the green glow was a pin dot no bigger than the tip of my pinky! i sat there talking to it, or rather threating it and cursing at it, i was not scared, a lil freaked but over all pissed off!!! by the time this happened i was so tired of being harrassed by nightly vists of what i have nick named \"space stalkers\" \"cosmos creepers\" \"dancing smurfs\" or \"the 3 footers\" \"the watchers\" and of course it wouldnt be a party with out shadow people. it began as an amazement up on gmr and completely blew my mind up on mt. baldy. those beautiful silver hugh silent objects, at first events spaced apart as to just mess with my mind, but, it was a curiosity, but then the visits and events became  more frequent, and surreal. i can only do this for so long,(tell these experiences i've had) before it hurts my head and i start to feel sick, worn out. i will write again and tell of the other things that have happend, okay,one more a short one: a ball i call them probes, they're a lil bigger than a soft ball slight smaller than a soccer ball, silver, i know right? but had small round brightly colored lights on it,very bright ,they seemed to like bounced in the air as they traveled, with a slight rotation of the colors. long story short, 2 got locked in my laundry room, my ex and i argued who would be the one to open the door and let them out. we lived in a mobile home and the laundry room was just outside the dinning room window as it is atatched you can look right into the laundry room. i lost the coin toss, so i ran and swung open the door, the first one flew out \"whoosh\" it was gone the second one slowly cautiously, peered out the door and timidly took a short unsure bounce in the air and slowly,almost timid, bounce to he edge and the went up and gone!

watch a thunderstorm roll in. the storm was moving west to east, and there were two layers of cloud preceding the actual rain. clouds in both layers were turbulent and broken. lower layer was thin and covered about 50%. upper layer was heavy cumulus clouds, but not so thick as to be really dark. both layers seemed to be moving at about the same speed, meaning that the lower layer was traversing my field of view more quickly than the upper layer. a couple of minutes before the rain hit, i saw a cluster of about 8 dark spots moving in the same direction as the storm, but faster. they were at about 55 degrees up from the horizon, and in the southwest sky. my first thought was that it was a small flock of blackbirds outrunning the storm. as my attention was drawn to the cluster, i noted that the dark spots were blurry, and that there was no flapping of wings, or relative motion between the spots. they moved in unison from west to east as if they were one fixed object, always maintaining the same appearance, the same speed and same direction. they then passed behind some of the lower clouds. i got the impression that they were just at the height of the bottom of the upper clouds. this impression was probably due to their blurriness, which i surmised to have been caused by being barely within that cloud layer, and slightly obscured by thin cloud. however, when the cluster was not behind the lower cloud layer, its appearance was always the same illumination and blurriness. this leads me to believe that it was not just within the upper clouds, as that would surely have caused a variability of appearance. the cluster was traversing my field of view about 3 or 4 times faster than the lower cloud layer. that would have put them at 6 to 10 times faster than the storm speed. my guess is that they were at least 500 feet up, but no higher than 3000 ft. based on the height estimate, the cluster diameter would be 25 ft to 100 ft. there was no noise, and no apparent light emission. there did not appear to be any geometric pattern to the dark spots. when the cluster passed closest to me, directly to the south, it appeared about 65 degrees above the horizon. i lost sight of the cluster after about 25 seconds, when it was in the southeast at about 50 degrees elevation from the horizon. it became obscured behind clouds in the lower layer. based upon my estimates of 3000 ft elevation and 25 seconds, i would estimate its speed at 80 miles per hour. the grey color that was between and around the dark spots seemed to always match the sky color, supporting the premise that it was a cluster of separate objects.  however the constant appearance, speed and direction of the cluster gave it the feeling of one unified object, which might have been cloaked somehow.\r\ni had no emotional feelings during or after the sighting. the cloudburst shortly afterward was not extremely severe, but it was a good heavy rain for about 10 minutes. what struck me as most unusual was that while conventional aircraft avoid storm clouds, this craft seemed to be within a storm system by choice. the storms that day were patchy summer smaller storms that would have been easy to avoid. also, it would have been much safer to fly at lower altitude and avoid the possible turbulence at the lower edge of the heavy cloud. the speed of the cluster was apparently sufficient to be able to avoid being within the storm system. if the object had been on the same trajectory before i spotted it, it would have been within or very near to the rain squall.\r\ni did not get a photo, as i spent the entire time trying to characterize what i was seeing. its appearance was pretty subtle, so it might not have shown up very well in a photo anyhow.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
