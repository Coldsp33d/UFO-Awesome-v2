general area over quebec, canada near gatineau/aylmer.  it was 7:50pm on july 26, 2015, not dark yet and there was a fair amount of cloud cover stretching across the sky but more blue than cloud and the clouds were more white with only some darker areas.\r\n\r\ni was facing an open sky over quebec along the ottawa river and just got mesmerized by the cloud formations and all of a sudden my eyes were drawn to an odd shaped cloud - for the ones around it - it was pretty close to a perfect circle, very strange.  the circle was about the size of a cdn nickel in total and the round cloud was quite white and a little opaque.  i could have just looked away but something seemed to be in the centre of that circular cloud so i got out the binoculars.\r\n\r\ni was so stunned when i got the binoculars in focus to see what looked like 7 or 8 small bright white objects(size of a third of a pea and round) and 5 of them were in the shape of a chevron and those were stationary and then there were 3 around the chevron and those were moving around, a little quick.  i figured that the 5 lights/objects were attached to one larger thing as they didn't move at all but there was no definite outline of a bigger object.  i watched this odd formation for several minutes and then it all disappeared slowly so i am not sure if it faded on it's own or a cloud came across it all and hid it again.  never saw it again after that.\r\n\r\ni was really surprised to see this formation and wondered about stars but it was in no way stars as they were too close and in a definite pattern of a chevron and the other dots of light, like the ones making up the chevron, behaved differently in that they were moving around instead of staying still like the other 5 of the same size.\r\n\r\ni had the feeling, can't explain why, that this formation was hiding in the clouds and honestly if you were just looking up at the sky you wouldn't even notice this formation in that round circle of cloud.  the only reason i found it was because i do have a good view of the sky, up higher, and clouds are something i like to look like and i do that fairly often.  my eyes are often pulled to certain cloud formations that seem to stand out for whatever reason, odd shapes and things and this is the second time that something strange came out of one of those sightings of an odd shaped cloud.  the first time it was discounted by mufon but i still think it was a ufo and not a plane because of it's size and the way it moved.  i guess we will have to agree to disagree on that one. \r\n\r\ni am really starting to wonder if people looked at certain clouds for just that little longer they would see ufos hiding as well.  i saw a video on youtube once where someone had filmed what they called 'the formation of a cloud by a ufo' i am guessing they are suggesting something similar, that they are hiding behind clouds.  i am not saying this grouping of ufos i just saw awhile ago was a cloud formed by the ufos but they were definitely right in the middle of the round cloud and i did feel they were trying to stay unseen.  very strange experience.  i drew what i saw, i'm a terrible artist so hope you get the drift.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":68655,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.4294596,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07262015-0053","longitude":-75.69159309999999,"occurred":1437940380000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1437945654000,"summary":"Odd

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Orange orbs and phosphorus\r\n\r\non the evening of august 31, 2014 i had my first observation and video capture of an orange orb.  to call it orange is somewhat of a misnomer.  the attached image will bear that out as it appears orange.   however from my first observation of it, the light given off was really quite brilliant and more yellowish.  the rays which emanated from it also had a peculiar quality that normally i do not see with light.  there was definition to the rays, and they came to a point.  the camera phone which took the image just does no justice to the reality.\r\n\r\ni first became aware of more research into the orange orb phenomenon in the may 2015 issue of mufon’s ufo journal.  the article authored by robert spearing went into good detail of 110 sightings in new jersey between january 2009 and january 2015.  one of the commonalities is that they appear in areas which are rich in phosphorus such as certain coastal waters, and other waterways which have runoff from fertilizer.  other coincidences of high orb sightings occurs during the 4th of july celebrations, and new year’s eve due to the phosphorus in fireworks.\r\n\r\nanother mufon member besides myself who lives in the northeast independence, mo area has also seen many orange orbs.  i decided to investigate known phosphorus levels in the missouri river near to where she lives, and blue springs lake where i saw mine.  the attached charts show the content.\r\n\r\nthe two sampling sites bs-4 and bs-11 show that between july 14 and september 25, 2014, the levels of phosphorus increased to nearly double the average recommended ecoregion criteria.  this is mostly from runoff from neighborhoods and annual fertilization of yards.  \r\n\r\nwhen compared with the previous year, the period from august 15 and september 11, 2013 the site bs-3 also showed a spike above the recommended level.  however, clearly there was much more available in august and september 2014, the time period in which i observed the orb.   \r\n\r\nthe year 2012 saw a ufo flap in missouri in the blue springs-independence-lee’s summit area.  an interesting observation is that a huge spike of phosphorus occurred in blue springs lake.  after researching the mufon files, i noticed 27 filed reports of different types of craft.  most of my search parameters included “spheres”, “circles”, “fireball”, and “other”.  they did not all however resemble orange orbs.  some did, others were clearly larger craft.  yet there was a lot of activity for that two month period.  the following shows the 900% increase from the normal levels of phosphorus which occurred in august 2012.\r\n\r\noverall in the state of missouri, smithville lake, truman lake, and long branch lake are about the same in phosphorus content on an average basis as blue springs lake.  in kansas though, millford lake, and tuttle creek lake are about 7 times higher in phosphorus than the recommended ecoregion criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe missouri river basin\r\nthe flow of the missouri river from its headwaters in montana, through its flowing into the mississippi river north of st. louis, is shown in the attached map.\r\n\r\nthe entire missouri river from its source down through the state of missouri gathers phosphorus from surrounding farmlands through fertilizer catchments.  it happens that the area of sightings in northeast independence by the river corresponds to the area of highest density of phosphorus from incremental catchments, in the “bullseye” of the region.  that area has over 200 kilograms per square kilometer per year. this is the equivalent of over 440 pounds of phosphorus per .4 square miles.\r\n\r\nsummary\r\n1.\tit is now obvious that at least two areas of known phosphorus activity in bodies of water in the independence, blue springs, lee’s summit area are also areas of orange orb activity.\r\n2.\tboth areas are not restricted however to sightings of orange orbs.  many other types of craft happen to frequent the entire area.\r\n3.\tspearing’s article focused only on orange orb activity in those areas of phosphorus.  it is quite possible that other craft also find the areas to be of interest as well, whether for the phosphorus content, or for other reasons as yet to be discovered.\r\n4.\tthe lake of the ozarks area has seen reports of 31 sightings on the mufon site.  its phosphorus levels generally over the area are about twice the recommended ecoregion criteria levels, although not enough information was available to compare the sightings with the timing of the phosphorus measurements.  \r\n5.\tthe area of the james river basin south of springfield has many high phosphorus levels.  there have been over 50 sightings in the springfield area, although not enough information was available to compare the sightings with the timing of the phosphorus measurements.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

the weather of that evening: it was light, temperature was comfortable, perhaps 20°c. the streets were dry and the trees full of green leaves. in the sky the cloud cover was closed and i saw a flying

to see and listen. but i heard nothing but the highway no. 1 (2 km away). shape: it was a triangle. in the edges there were very intense white lights and in the middle i saw a small red light - i think it was blinking but am not sure. i could not see a light beam.\r\n\r\nthe velocity was constant. the path was straight. i have problems to guess the hight and speed and its size. but: we know s.

huber, ga. i was an oiler(helper) on a dragline. part of my job was to operate the machine. had a 2 man crew, 3 shifts, 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week. we were in a clearing surrounded by miles of forests. on the 11pm-7am shift, each person would would run the machine 4 hours and sleep 4 hours. one night about 2/3am i was operating the machine and saw a large light appear at the edge of my vision to the right, just over the tree tops. it moved slowly into view. when i saw the shape i was shaken. it was a \"flying saucer\", with an orange body and red dome. i watched it for 2-3 minutes, stopped the machine and ran to wake up the operator. (he was pretty sharp, kind of a redneck, had been around, so he knew about lots of things). we got to the operators booth(about 30 ft off the ground). the ufo was was about in the center of our vision. we watched it slowly move across the treetops untill it was out of sight to the left. we guessed it was about 80 ft. long with a 20 ft. in diameter dome. the operator looked at me and said \"don't you say anything about this to anybody\". so 2 people saw this for about 10 minutes and agreed it was a ufo. i never said anything untill years later when ufos would come up in conversation. \r\n\r\nafter watching some of your shows on discovery, another aspect came to me. i had almost forgotten about it. missing time.\r\n \r\nthe mine ran 24-7 365. we had a recording unit that kept a graph on a scroll.\r\nanother worker showed me how to turn the machine off and said if i wanted to take a little nap while the other guy slept, just turn it off. i did this one night and told the operator about it the next night. he came un-glued. he stopped the clock, pulled the scroll out and showed me how the managers could plainly see the \"short shift\". i promised him i would never do it again. about a month later i took a break from work and went up to the operator booth. the operator was very mad. he said \"you stopped the clock again\". he pulled the scroll out and there was 45 minutes missing on our last shift. i don't remember stopping that clock. i didn't put this together till i saw your show. \r\n\r\ni came home from the navy about 1982-83 era, went to the mine to see some old buddies and asked about my operator. they said right after i left the mine he found out he had cancer and was dead in a few months.\r\n\r\nafter moving around all those years, i now live about 5 miles from where we saw the ufo. never saw another one or been abducted, that i know of. \r\n\r\nso: ufo, missing time and your buddy died of cancer a few years after seeing the ufo.\r\n\r\nthere is so much we don't know about.\r\n\r\ng. t. gray jr.\r\n26jul15\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:12:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":68640,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.8441946,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07262015-0038","longitude":-83.62669220000001,"occurred":72155700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1437934989000,"summary":"2am-at work- forrested area with clearing-with witness-saw ufo treetop level appear right horizon to left horizon-saucer shaped-glowing orange with red dome","tags":["ufo","saucer"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":26,"meantempi":78,"meanvism":15,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":19,"mintempi":66,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":26,"meantempi":78,"meanvism":15,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":19,"mintempi":66,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"31217","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":15807,"locationName":"Macon, Georgia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:16748"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Shelburne","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Shelburne, nova scotia. \r\n9:45pm monday, june 14, 2014. \r\nchatting with, more listening to, co-workers. \r\nlooking up at the clear darkening sky above and at the sun setting and the appearing stars, every now and then. on one look-up, i saw three circular discs in a triangular formation;

crash site). it was around 11 pm . i was outside smoking and looking up at the stars as usual. i had my cell phone and was taking pictures of scenery when i noticed something blinking in the sky. i it kept getting brighter. it seemed like it was changing color but was hard to tell because of its place in the sky. i took out my cell phone and kept photographing it. went back inside to check the baby.I sat for a bit and was examining the photos. to ky suprise it was a disc shape object changing and morphing into small red, green, blue, white and silver orbs. which i have both video and photographic evidence. so after about an hour or two i went back outside to look and see if it was still there. i looked at the postion that it was in and it was gone.I then used the phone camera to see if i could see it somewhere else the sky. looking through the camera i panned the sky and turning to my right the trailer was in view.  omg i saw a craft hovering over the trailer about 20 feet above and a golden beam coming out from underneath it. ithen looked with the naked eye and it was gone. i looked through the phone again and it was still there. after several times of doing this i had come to the conclusion that i couldnt see it with the naked eye but through the camera alone. the beam coming out of it had multiple silver orbs either being emitted or retrieving them. the craft was dull silver but i could see that with the naked eye but not the beam. the timing was really weird.I dnt know how long i was examing what i was seeing but found out later that it had been about 2 more hours had gone past. it was hovering all thattime and just disappeared like nothing ....Like in a blink of an eye. i can describe it better in person. after this experience i posted it online to a friend....The pics and videos of both the orb changing colrs and the craft and beam. and after i did.... my life has beeen altered. i cant have an email...Every phone that i purchase will not work properly as if my calls and msgs are being diverted to another number, i havent had an email or phone since then. only a land line and it is affected as well.But need that for emergency. if someone gets in touch with me i have photos and video of both incidents. thanks for your time.... love and light\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkim muic   07/25 2015 \r\nto get in contact with me...The best is by

exited the rear east side of our home, into the completely dark back yard.  i was going next door, where my parents were visiting neighbors.  i took about two steps into the backyard when i realized there was a yellow self-luminous saucer shaped craft at my 11 o'clock at a height of 50-70 feet.  i immediately realized it was a ufo.  it was stationary, smooth, featureless, no seams, rivits, windows or markings.  it looked very much like the old moon hubcaps.  within 3-5 seconds it silently glided away southbound, rising at about 15 degrees. after 10 seconds it turned eastboard and ascended at another 20-30 degrees.  it remained flat, never banking to turn.  i would estimate its size at 4o feet.  it did not spin and was completely silent.  there was no down drafts, heat or visible means of propulsion.\r\n\r\nthe first thing i did upon seeing the ufo was to look for windows.  there were none.  the color, yellow, was a very middle of the road color.  what was interesting was that the entire craft was that color.  the color had depth to it, somewhat like looking at jello.  there definitely was not a glow or aura on the outside.  i could only see the bottom of the ufo at all times.  i got to observe it for at least 15 seconds as it slowly faded into the very starry night.  i remember thinking i could have easily hit it with my bow and arrow.\r\n\r\ngrowing up, i observed three atomic bomb tests.  i lived near area 51, without knowing it at the time.  i saw rockets and all kinds of aircrafts as my father's job took him to airforce bases working for the corps of engineers.  i was a police officer for 24 years and never observed a ufo again.","distance":"21-100

look at me! i couldn't focus on her and my eyes wandered around the sky. i felt as if i was looking at something but nothing was there. my vision was altered and i was no longer perceiving the earth for the reality i normally did. my girlfriend appeared foreign. i had seen her as if she was not human, through the eyes of something else. i had continued to break down and scream and cry frightfully until finally she stood me up and we began to pack. i could not walk normally, my steps were small and my eyes wandered and i turned my head looking all around me in confusion. with the help of my girlfriend we made it to the path that led back to my car and we saw one last orb. it flashed with green and red and eventually only white. it was the only one with these colors. the experience was over but my mind continued to break down for some time until we returned home and i was able to sleep. the following night my girlfriend laid awake and noticed what looked like a shooting star. followed by more and more until she thought it was a meteor shower. she realized that these were the same orbs we saw the night before and looked online and noticed there were no meteor showers that night in our area.

like sparks from the bottom of the object.  he immediately, ran around back to the garage where he explained to myself and my other two brothers what we had seen.  we immediately ran around to the back of the house where our younger brother pointed to where he had seen the object and it was no longer there. however to the right of where the cigar shaped object was. was now a bright pulsating round object hovering steadily above the treetops.  at this time my brother ran into the house and got my older sister and mother to come outside and look at this object with us.  when they arrived was it hovering in place making no noise and it emitted a reddish, yellow and orange glow.  it stayed stationary for a few minutes and then began to move slowly to the right approximately 500' before hovering again for another few minutes.  at this time my sister ran into the house to see if we had a camera to get a photo or binoculars to get an even better close up look at the object.  she returned a few minutes later with neither.  at this time it was still hovering  approximately 100 to 200' feet above the tree tops.  the object then began to move slowly away from us towards the mountains to the nw and did not change shape or color for the next 4 to 5 minutes.  it then seemed to change course to due north and then upward and sped off at great speed and disappeared from sight.  we were all stunned by this observation.  at the time this sighting occurred this area was very rural with very few neighbors as we wanted to call other and see if they had seen the objects.  my mother called what neighbors were around to enquire if they had seen anything without results.  my mother then called the nearest major city st. louis (90 miles north) tv station kmov channel 4 to see if they had received any reports of this sighting and the did not.  we had ample amount of time to see and study this object.  it was not an aircraft, ballon, cloud formation, smoke or a planet.  we were all amazing calm during this sighting and wanted to understand what this object was.  to this day we still discuss this sighting and its unusual charaecterists.
