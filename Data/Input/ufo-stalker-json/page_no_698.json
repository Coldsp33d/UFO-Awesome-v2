traveled south on lovers lane (approximately 5 mph), a row of trees blocked our view of the orbs. once passing the trees, we then observed only 3 orbs in a triangular formation with one orb leading and the two other orbs behind, where all 3 appeared equidistant. all three orbs remained in perfect formation, slowing traveling north at approximately 10 mph, unwavering, as if they were on a track. as the orbs traveled, the front orb slowly faded, as if on dimmer switch, until it completely disappeared, which was evident when stars showed where it once was.\r\nonce the two back orbs reached the

silencieux dans les alentours ,je suis persuadã© que j'observe un ovni,apres quelques, 4 a 5 minutes,je reparti la motoneige,pour m'avancer vers l'ovni,& ces a ce moment ,qu'il disparu en 1 fraction de secondes,cette journã©e la ,il avait neigã©,toute la journã©e,& que nous ã©tions seul sur le lac geoffrion qui compte 32 chalets,& que je connais cet endroit depuis 27 ans a l'ã©poque,je suis un astronome amatteur,depuis l'age de 7 ans,& cet endroit,est sans lumiere de villes ou, autres.Ces endroit idã©al pour observã© le ciel ã©toilã©.Apres cet observation, je me sius rendu a l'endroit ou j'avais vue l'ovni & au sol il n'y avait aucune trace quelconque dans la neige fraiche,a ce moment la,je n'avait plus de doutte,c'ã©tait bien un ovni!Ca ma rendu tres euphorique,au contaire de mon amie,qui elle avait peur.Ce que je ne savais pas ce soir la ,ces que j'aurai ,1 autre observation,que je ferai en 2009,en mauricie au quã©bec,dans le petit village de charette,1 soir d'hiver,j'observait les ã©toiles ,depuis prãªt de 1 heure a l'arriere de la maison de mes parents,il fait tres froid ce soir la - 35 degrã©s celcius,& je suis sur le point d' entrã©e pour me rã©chauffã©,que cet a ce moment que j'aperã§oit,un grosse boule lumineuse de couleur orangã©,elle se dã©place,en zigzag,un peu comme une bulle de savon qui flotte dans l'air,je regarde en direction nord-ouest,& la boule orangã© se dã©place vers le nord-est,elle se dã©place sur une distance de 2 kilometres,a une altitudes au dã©but de, 200 pieds ,avec une montã©e lente de 20 degrã©,rendu a 2 kilometres ,du point de dã©part,elle devient un point rouge ,plus petits & laisse une trainã©e pareil comme un laser,apres elle devient vert vif, encore plus petit en laissant une trainã© pareil a 1

didn't even think to get a camera i just watched, i had a dog at the time i found it strange that she didn't come out in the back garden as she normally does when i go out for a smoke i didn't report it at the time because i didn't know who to report it to i had no photo/video evidence it was very quiet out in the back at the time of the event like no one else was around i didn't want to start

whenever i blinked, there were flashes of light casted on the tops of the trees in front of me. i didn't list this, but i could've sworn i saw a projected beam but didn't list this as i'm not sure if that was my eyes playing tricks on me. when i stared at the object, i saw visions of the orb in the eyes of random animals. for instance, i would see very distant smoke/clouds in the shape of a shark,

directly observable and low in the sky. as i looked at it, directly to the right was what i assumed a twinkling reddish-orange light, perhaps venus. i soon noticed it was actually moving toward my location. planes and helicopters often flyover, so i wasn't surprised until i noticed that the twinkling lights were too numerous to be landing lights. there was neither variation in color, nor any blinking, and no engine noise that would be expected at low altitude. the speed of the object was consistent with a helicopter or small plane.\r\n\r\nas the object came closer, the lights began flickering out over 3/4 of the object until a single point of light remained, which also faded out completely. by this time the object was directly overhead and i could still discern the outline against the sky. it was black, opaque, and shaped like an isosceles triangle. i'm certain of the shape as i turned around to watch it go over the house i lost it for a moment, when i refocused, the object had changed location to the point where i determined its path was not a straight line. shortly thereafter i lost sight of the object over the trees.\r\n\r\nfrom the lighting behavior, it is possible this was some sort of meteorite, but that doesn't explain the angular shape nor its flight pattern. my wife proposed it was a b-2 stealth aircraft but that doesn't explain why it'd be lit inconsistently over civilian airspace... and while they're both triangular, this object was not shaped like a b-2.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

going home from the convenient store and normally i would ride home taking the street saddle south towards my houses street but instead i had a sudden feeling to turn left going east to take dublin street so i did and about half way on dublin just before it starts to curve north east i seen these 4-5 bright white orbs moving in the sky. all 4-5 orbs would emit a trail of sparks as it appeared, nothing like fire and i can't recall if when emitting sparks whether it made sound or not, also there was no particular order of emitting sparks/glowing/disappearing etc.\r\n\r\nwhen the orbs weren't emitting these sparks, sometimes they'd turn off the white glow and very faintly they would appear blue and about the size of the stars if looking at the night sky while still moving. then from being a blue light they'd start glowing white then sometimes emitting the sparks at random as it appeared to me. so in the video when they seem to disappear they were actually turning into the small blue orbs.\r\n\r\ni took a photo then took the video afterwards. at the time i was using my t-mobile samsung galaxy cell phone which had a 1.5 megapixel camera so i had to turn night mode on as well increase the brightness just so that these objects would appear on my screen. picking up the emitted sparks was a no go unfortunately.\r\n\r\nthey started to move more north-north east in the sky and while descending turning off and on the white glow to blue glow they no longer were emitting the sparks in this process. i faintly seen a light shooting off from the ground up into the sky north-north east towards these orbs direction and it seemed as though the orbs were descending downward within the area and one in the center of this long beam of light. once the last object was out of sight the beam of light vanished.\r\n\r\nthis is the end of my sighting.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

basement living with my parents . as i walked out of the pool area i opened the gate and at that moment i noticed strange lights hovering above the neighbors barn. i figured it was nothing so i kept walking to the end of the driveway about 30 feet from the house. i then was curious what the lights were so i looked up again. the craft was north east from my driveway hovering about as high as a grown oak tree as we have many on the property. i dropped the garbage bag and walked up to the object looking straight up the object was about 10 feet from the driveway.  as i walked up to the craft  i observed it as the orange red lights which were at the bottom of the triangle and the greenish light was at the tip of the craft. the craft was not moving at this point but it would rotate counter clock wise slowly. the lights on the craft were just bright enough to see a solid black frame which was the triangle itself with specs of white lights kind of polka doted on the craft. the main light that we're green,yellow,red did not look like they were connected to the craft. now as i stood there for about 1 minute approximately two black helicopters approached the craft on each side. these copters did not have any lights but were loud and could clearly see the shape of the copter. the two copters then tuned off and flew out  of sight. after these chain of events i ran to the front of the house and told my brother and my dad to come out i was scared as i did not know what was going on . as my brother and father stood on the front door step i had lost all sight of the craft so i convinced them to stay in case the craft came back as it was cold and they both thought i was nuts . after about two minutes of walking on the front yard the craft then moved from the same direction the farm was behind the house,it went over the house and turned south as the craft did not change altitude but seemed to sag to the left. the craft then slowly disappeared into the tree line. what was very interesting is it looked like the craft was just flying right through the trees as if they weren't even there before we lost sight of the object.Whenever the craft moved it moved very slowly in a sluggish motion.All of us were so focused on looking at the craft so no pictures or film was presented . thank you mufon i am happy that i could share my experience.","distance":"20 Feet or

be a new experimental fighter jet like the stealth bomber?  earlier that afternoon, a virginia state police helicopter was flying low, up and down the beach, several passes.  we all wondered what it

something else. being out in the county i figured i might get lucky. i seen 2 or 3 more shooting stars and then 2 airplanes and i even heard the first one. i knew they were planes.I started watching the stars again and it got pretty still. i was looking in the opposite direction of the big dipper and i seen a dot so small i thought it was a star. then i noticed it was moving. it was moving fast because it was so far away but it covered a lot of sky. it almost looked as if it was weaving through the stars like it was dodging them or something. i tracked the object fir about 30 to 45 seconds when i lost sight of it. i stayed an extra 10 15 minutes outside trying to find it but i had no luck. i could feel the hair on my neck stand up and my heart was beating pretty fast. if you have any questions, you can contact me through facebook. search keeg meister and you'll find me sticking up my middle finger. message me. its not a very big sighting or anything but i feel like it did it on purpose because once my friend went in the house, i i used my phone screen as like a signal to see if anything happened. i doubt they'd see that from that far away but i saw the object right after i put my phone up cause i started feeling stupid. again, it looked exactly like a star and it did nit move in a straight line. almost like it was weaving between the stars.

of the trailor park where i lived. i noticed lights coming across a small field directly towards me. my first thought as i turned into my driveway stepping out of my car was, that seems too low for an airplane and it's too quiet. as i stood watching, these lights came closer,slowly and eventually stopping directly overhead. this craft was barely 100 feet overhead, i could have hit it with a rock. this craft barely made a sound at first, much lower than a hum, difficult to describe. no downdraft at all and the trees directly below it weren't moving.As i stood there frozen, i remember thinking ,i have to remember everything about what i was seeing. the craft was sort of oval shape. i was looking directly above. the craft was very black, difficult to make out the exact edges. it was about 100 feet long and maybe 35 to 40 feet wide. bluefish white lights shining outward from each end and side. a solid small deep red light underneath and it appeared to be very slightly wobbling reminded me of how a magnet wobbles when you try to float it over a repelling magnet. as i stood there i realized that my knees were actually knocking together and i was shaking. as i looked around the park. i saw that no other homes had there lights on at this time of about 11:30 pm. i thought, what if this thing kills me or takes me, no one would know what happened. i ran up my driveway and hid down behind my car. this seemed almost funny to me later as i thought about it. as i continued to watch it, the craft slowly, quietly began to move at the same height along the park road towards the main road. i'm not sure where i got the courage but i couldn't believe what i was seeing. i got in my car and headed towards the main road. when i drove out of the woods into the open at the main road the craft was on the other side of the street hovering at tree top level. i shut off my engine and got out and stood on the hood looking at this now side view craft. it still appeared very dark but i could see that it had 3 small lights spaced quite a ways apart blinking in success, 1 red 1 blue and 1 green. it also had what looked like small dimly yellowish internally illuminateing lit windows running the lenght of the craft. it hovered there with me starring at it for what seemed like a minute or two then slowly starting moving off in a southerly direction following the main road back towards town. i got in my car and headed in the same direction. this thing was traveling just above the trees off to my right about 200 feet. it was matching my speed of 60 mph and followed alongside for about a mile and veered off out of sight. a couple miles further down the road i turned into the parking lot of a closed small town store where i could look out over a large valley type area. a few moments later i saw the same craft which was now about a quarter mile away do a big arc over the valley and fly out of sight. i started driving home, i was so wound up and excited that i just wanted to call someone and tell them what i had just experienced. as i was driving home, i saw the object in my review mirror about a half mile behind me. i stopped the car and got out. i watched it again veer off and fly out of sight. i drove the couple miles home and as i was turning into my yard, the craft flew over the far end of the park at a much faster speed than before and out of sight. i sat outside on the deck for quite a while that night but did not see it again. this entire experience lasted about 45 minutes. even though this sighting occurred 22 years ago, i still can remember vivid details and how i felt. even while writing this, it still seems impossible and difficult for me to accept.But it is absoulatel true and the strangest thing i have ever experienced.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Path then
