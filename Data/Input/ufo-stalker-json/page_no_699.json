it was very bright and i could not make out the shape of the object making the light.  it was flashing irregularly, but not fast. i pulled over to watch it.  it seemed to just hover over the tree line at the top of the ridge, then systematically move down hill.  then it would move back to the top of the ridge a little to the east and do it again.  as i watched, i flashed my headlights in an attempt to get their attention.  then, out of the corner of my eye, i saw what appeared to be a very large vessel very high up in the air.  it was mainly pink and kind of blimp shaped.  it had what appeared to be lights around the center, but i can't recall what color they were now.\r\n\r\ni was so excited, i got in my car and drove the few miles left to my house.  my plan was to wake my mother up to see

army personnel all around the fence surrounding the latrobe airport. then later that night as i was going home via the same route, there was something on the runway (out of view as it was down in a gully) that was flashing and lighting up the sky.  i don't recall seeing army personnel then.","distance":"Over One

summer of 1979, that left a strong impression with me that lasts to this day and has informed my world view as i have gotten older. i have never forgotten it, and my brief (less than a minute, probably more like 15-20 seconds) encounter is burned in my brain like a movie. i have talked about it my whole life to friends and family and other people that i felt would be mature about it, and my story has changed zero through retelling and the passage of time; my memory is crystal clear on this event in spite of my young age at the time of the event, and the experience was interesting enough that it doesn't need embellishment or creative additions or for me to try to speculate on it for it to be the most interesting thing i have seen with my own eyes before or since.\r\n\r\ni was 6 going on 7 and with my mother in a diner in albany, ga, sitting at a booth with wide windows that stretched the width of the restaurant and went floor-to-ceiling (typical diner layout where the walls are essentially windows all the way around), affording a clear view of outside including the sky. it was a clear night, and having recently become a young and frequent airplane traveler with my family, i was fascinated with airplanes and obsessively watched planes in the sky.\r\n\r\nthis night as i was watching planes slowly fly across the horizon through our table's window pane (albany has a small regional airport and a significant military presence, as i will expand on later, hence the airplanes), i saw something which i thought very unusual at the time, and i am still fascinated by it. i was young, but the experience is burned in my memory as though it was yesterday, and i feel that my memory is still very pure, and hasn't been complicated by the information on the ufo phenomenon that i have since come to be interested in.\r\n\r\ni was young and unfortunately did not know which directions (n,s,e,w) anything was at that point in my life. no idea which direction it flew. i noticed out of the corner of my eye a very intense green light in the sky through the far left side of the window pane at our booth. it was travelling left to right on a horizontal (to the ground) trajectory (straight horizontal line) much quicker than the obvious airplanes i was watching (there were several planes over the course of our visit to the diner). the green light phenomenon behaved differently from anything i had ever observed, and i loved to watch the sky for airplanes all the time. it moved from left to right at a seemingly quick clip. i locked eyes on it, and when it reached the middle of my vantage point it abruptly stopped (on a dime, instantly), pulsed (became visually bigger by about double), then just as quickly went back to it's original size and took off at about a 45% angle towards the sky. when it took off from this momentary stop, it went so fast that if i had blinked i would have thought it had simply disappeared. but i saw it leave, and it was gone in a fraction of a second. the first half of the flight path, prior to it pulsing, took probably 15-20 seconds, long enough for me to lock eyes on it, get excited and try to get my mom and other adults' attention. but when it left it was gone in the blink of an eye. no one else saw it, but my obvious excitement caused a great deal of others to get excited in the restaurant. everyone felt i was sincere and too young to have just made it up, that i had definitely seen something strange. being so young i don't think i even knew about the ufo phenomena and was just excited over this unusual light and i wanted an adult to see it and tell me what it was, i didn't have the vocabulary or knowledge of the subject to call it a ufo or to speculate that it was alien. i figured an adult would know what it was. i just recognized it was unusual compared to planes which i knew something about (and was obsessed with), and was extraordinarily fast. there was talk among those at the diner about calling the paper, they really took me to be sincere in that i at least believed that i saw what i saw. my mom decided to not allow the paper to be called because she is not the type to want the hassle and complication in her and my life, and she didn't want me to be mocked over it or get a reputation as a weirdo in such a conservative area of the country. star wars was all the rage with my age group and it would have been easy to chalk it all up to an active imagination from a star wars-obsessed boy, which i admittedly was, along with every other kid in my age in the 70s. but that was a movie and i never made an association between that light in the southwest georgia sky and movie science fiction. i just didn't have \"ufo\" in my vocabulary or as a point of reference.\r\n\r\none thing that i swear happened, or that i felt strongly (and still do) had happened, was that the phenomenon seemed to be aware that i had seen it and had locked eyes on it. i feel that when it stopped and pulsed before shooting off, that that was a communication to me, like \"hello, we know you see us, and we see you and are saying hello\". i can't explain why, but i truly felt right there at the time that i had exchanged some sort of simple greeting with the phenomenon, or that it had specifically acknowledged me, and that the interaction was friendly and as real as if someone physically in my presence were to talk to me. i can't explain in words why i felt/feel that way, it was just as though a message or feeling entered my head, i'll use the word \"telepathically\" now (although i knew nothing of telepathy or anomalous phenomena at the time of the event to have used that word or concept) and it was a real phenomenon that i didn't have the capacity, imagination, or environmental influence to invent at that age.\r\n\r\nthe phenomenon itself was a very intense green light, roughly the size or a small but easily visible star. like a pinprick way up in the sky. when it pulsed it became roughly double in size. the green light was very pure, very bright, very sharp, not fuzzy at all around the edges. small but very defined. the color of green was purer that any green light i have seen before or since, just pure, deep, and beautiful, unwavering, not flickering, and very deep and intense (though small) in a way that is difficult to put into words but not like a typical light in the sky. it was a very, for lack of better vocabulary, unearthly in it's perfection and depth and brilliance. it did not change color at all. just the most amazing brilliant green i have ever seen, something no light i have ever known quite reaches in terms of brilliance and depth, and also focus (no halo, so blurred edges, just very tight and compressed if you will).\r\n\r\nas i mentioned, i didn't have any knowledge or background in ufo lore or the phenomenon or flying saucers or whatever at all at that age. i didn't have the information to speculate it was alien or to call it a ufo. those concepts just weren't something i knew about yet. i did not try to classify it at the time or act like i had a theory on what it was, i wouldn't have known where to start, i was just very excited and my excitement excited those around me. everyone believed that i saw something that had genuinely aroused me, i didn't invent it, nobody thought i did, and my main concern after the event was to ask the adults present to explain to me what it was. i tried like crazy to get an adult's attention in the short time i was observing it, just so a grownup could explain to me what it was. i assumed that adults present would know and that it would be some mundane thing that i got all excited about but that adults would explain as common. but it was the adults that brought the idea of a ufo into the conversation and some advocated calling the media. unfortunately, by the time i made enough of a scene to get peoples' attention, the phenomenon was gone. i was the only direct witness, but many people witnessed my reaction and listened to my description. my mother and i still talk about it. she says that i was fully taken at my word, that i could not have faked the excitement, and that the consensus was that, at best i had seen something very strange, and at worst i had seen nothing especially strange but that i was truthful in my belief that i had.\r\n\r\ni will repeat that i did not have the knowledge of the very real ufo phenomena to have applied a ufo hypothesis to what i saw. i didn't have the basic knowledge at that age to say ufo, flying saucer, alien, or anything like that, i simply wasn't aware that those were things or debates that were in society's culture. totally ignorant of the phenomenon. i was in first or second grade.\r\n\r\nfull disclosure, and this is something i have come to know as time passed: there was and still is an active marine corps logistic base in the area and i believe that a now defunct navy base was still operational in albany at the time as well. i am fully acknowledging that i may have seen a military craft doing something that to me was unknown exotic technology and seemed un-airplane like, but certainly could have been military technology. that's the simplest explanation, really, and i'm not claiming it was an et craft by any means. it'd be cool if it was for sure, but i will not pretend to know something that i don't know, or ignore the real and likely possibility that i indeed saw something of this earth. maybe it was military or even something else. but i have never seen anything before or since that was anything like it. the indescribably strange nature or the green light, the ability to stop/pause on a dime, and then to take off from a complete stop at an inestimable but incredible rate of speed at a 45% angle from it prior path...It was an awesome display of aeronautics if nothing else.\r\n\r\na few things i must freely own up to: i have no idea now big in size the object/light was, how far away it was, how fast it actually moved, the direction of travel or it's elevation. i was simply too young to be thinking about those things or have any perspective. i doubt anyone could have figured it out actually, it was a pin-prick of light very high on the horizon, above the airplanes that i saw by quite a bit, with nothing that i recall to provide a scale comparison. no mountains. there is no photo obviously to try to make measurements. i do know absolutely that from my vantage point it was the size of a small but clearly discernible star (except when it briefly pulsed and seemed to temporarily double in size.) was it huge and far away? was it smaller and closer? i don't know. before speeding off, if it had simply maintained it's original speed and direction it would have crossed the width of my view considerably faster than the airplanes i was watching. it took planes two minutes or more to cross the horizon from my vantage point and you could easily trace their path slowly and see their normal airplane lights and beacon lights (i knew about identifying common airplanes because i had recently become an air traveler and planes were basically my #1 fascination at that time). this was definitely not just a garden-variety airplane. maybe a black-project development from our military, but nothing normal as far as i knew or know now, and i am an avid sky watcher.\r\n\r\ni don't know what i saw, but it has been quite meaningful to me and is frequently in my thoughts even 30+ years later, and the experience has always stayed with me, become a part of who i am, and has shaped me in some strange ways. i felt i was communicated with by the phenomenon, that we had the equivalent of a real-world \"head nod\", like a non-verbal communication, something like \"hey what's up, i see you seeing me, so hello! and now we are gone\". i felt like that message imprinted in me and it was real. i still feel as though i had a brief, non-threatening contact of sorts. whether i saw something otherworldly or not, i am different for having seen it, because i feel fairly sure that i know something that the rest of the world doesn't truly know, saw something few ever see, and they argue and speculate about it, but i know that anomalous stuff is in the sky definitely and it's special knowledge that many argue about but few possess. i may be wrong, but my gut says i saw something very special and had some form of casual contact with the phenomenon. i knew it was there and it knew i knew it was there, and it just sort of said \"hi\". this may be the active imagination of a kid, and i will freely acknowledge that this could be something mundane and that i had a curious nature and an active imagination as a kid. and star wars had all us kids thinking about space ships and whatnot. but i just didn't know about ufos at all and wasn't creating a ufo experience simply because i didn't have any knowledge of the ufo phenomenon and thus could not have associated my experience at that time with something that i didn't have any perspective or knowledge of. i was just amazed by an amazing sight in the sky, and had the unshakable feeling (still do) that whatever it was acknowledged me in a friendly way via \"psychic\" (for lack of a better word) communication.\r\n\r\nas i got older i became more fascinated by the ufo phenomenon, and now i consider myself as knowledgeable about the subject as many experts and far more than the \"man on the street\". this experience fed that lifelong fascination. i continue to watch the skies every night from my back yard in the country, and i have seen other spectacular lights and seemingly anomalous movements semi-regularly. i don't pretend to know what any of them are, and i don't claim that they are alien, many are probably satellites, exotic military craft, drones, you name it. none have been so clear as to seem like a sure-fire classic ufo case. once i was even faked out by venus. my wife was once faked out by fireflies out of season. i'll be the first to admit that strange things in the sky can and often are mundane, and they can appear anomalous due to any number or factors including human error.\r\n\r\nthat said, this 30+ year old experience and, whatever i saw, it strongly impacted me. i am a different person with different beliefs and a different way of looking at life than if this hadn't happened. i've never been normal since, not in a bad way, i just feel like more is out there than general society wants to acknowledge, and i can't ignore what i at least think i know about the nature of our world and universe, and the (to me) fact that stuff happens in our skies that we can't easily explain. most people are willfully ignorant to this and just think you are weird if you show enthusiasm for ufos and whatnot. those that believe, it's preaching to the choir. i have zero evidence, and nothing i say here will change anyone's opinion, and it probably isn't an important thing to have written as far as contributing to the greater conversation. \r\n\r\nbut i wanted to write it down for myself if nothing else. i have been telling the story to select people for my whole life, and my mother and i still talk about it frequently, but i have never documented it. now i have decided to. it feels great to have written this down and shared it, a bit of catharsis, and now i feel like i can think about the meaning of this experience less and use my mind on stuff that is future and present-related, not live in the past so much. it's a strange thing when your world view is so profoundly shaped by a <1 minute experience from 35 years ago that no one else witnessed. not a bad thing, i just hope that now that i've put everything in writing and explained the story as well as i can given the limitations of my vocabulary and published it in a forum, it can take it's place as a cool memory but not something i have to dwell on in middle-age. i kind of need to move on. \r\n\r\ni hope somebody with the time, patience, and interest to read this long convoluted story will enjoy it and maybe it will help someone make sense of their own experience. if this benefits nobody, that's unfortunate but really this is mostly something i (selfishly) need to do for myself in documenting this experience which has so profoundly impacted me, and maybe now it will require less mental energy from me going forward.\r\n\r\na final note that may be neither here nor there...I was born during the ufo flap of 1973. sightings were being reported all over the place in georgia. 1979 was active too, and as i delve through archives i find that i was not the only person observing strange things in the sky. jimmy carter had his sighting in georgia within a few years of mine, and many others (a disproportionate number) were reported and witnessed in georgia around that time. also, i have always felt and at times have manifested some psychic abilities, although i can't control them or use them in any practical way. it's not up to me, but sometimes i find myself just simply knowing something that there is no way i should know. occasionally i have found that i seem to have some control/influence over certain people i meet, that they trust and follow me blindly, without me encouraging it, and i have no explanation for it, just the observation that i seem to be able to control and exert influence on certain (not even close to all) people, it's not something i try to do or can control, i just seem to occasionally induce certain people to behave in a way that suits me without really trying, like in whats seems to me a primitive telepathic way, some people i can tune into sometimes, but not with a great deal of control, it just happens. hard to explain and maybe a whole different rabbit trail. i can't say for sure, but i feel like this very low-level bit of psychic ability and awareness of things seems to have begun when i had what i believe was communication from the phenomenon during the event.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

was odd, i took out my phone to record the event, but it was too dark for it to record anything.  after i put my phone away and looked back up at the object, it had changed.  now it appeared, not as a cloud, but as a white light the magnitude of a relatively bright star surrounded by a whitish mist or aura.  i went inside to retrieve a pair of bionaculars. when i stepped back outside, the object had changed once again.  now it appeared as a cloud. through bionoculars, it appeared as a bright smug on the sky. the closest analog to its appearance would be a search light reflected off a cloud. the elapsed time from initially spotting the cloud until it disappeared over the horizon was approximately five minutes. the cloud-object was traveling in a straight line at what seemed to be the speed of a jetliner at cruising altitude; although, i don't know the height or distance away of the object so this assumption is

(not unlike a shooting star going in the wrong direction…up!) video 1:17 long shows what i saw pretty clearly. the encounter was so bizarre that it even completely changed my voice…as i had expressed utter disbelief. note: this is not my first encounter. i have seen ufo's before, up close and too personal--this is just my first time reporting my encounter because i caught the alien shenanigans on tape this time!\r\n\r\nas i continued to stare at the moon in shock i kept noticing a saturn orb-like light that just hovered beneath the moon at approx the 5:00 o'clock position in relation to the moons surface. it continued to move slowly about at will so it was not a planet, a big bright star or an aircraft. the video that is 1:07 seconds long, shows this object move from that position (5:00) to the 1:00 o'clock position in the last 2 seconds.

some are short. soon two orbs of light came out of the ship, one blue,one red,the orbs circled the craft,went back in, then a beam of light camefrom out of the craft and focused on our vehicle and filled inside of car with light,when the light hit us were paralyzed and unable move.Then there were entities surrounding vehicle at this point,only fout in total.Two on each side of the car,at the doors. we were taken aboard the ship, we each had implants inserted in our arms,in me on my right elbow,on my father,his hand. next i know we are back in the car,and the ship is still in front of us,a white misty fog is being produced by the ship. it then disappears into thin air,no high speed zoom away. it just simply vanished before my eyes. this happened approx 26years ago i still have the

lights surrounding this thing that i could not see very well. we stepped into the street to get a better look. adam started looking around the sky and we saw two more, kind of flickering and pulsating red, blue, green & white. he told me, \"john, people are going to think we're crazy.\" i said, yes they will. \r\nthen i asked adam if he wanted to see another one. he looked at me with a weird look. so i took him out front. there, we saw another star like object that is there every night. tonight it was pulsating between light blue, light green & white. no red on this one that night.\r\nso, my brother went home, got my mom to go outside to check it out. she also saw 5 small red lights around the color changing, pulsating, flickering star. since then, they have been checking out the night sky and have seen these objects do more strange thing. they we're watching a couple nights ago and saw it change colors and saw a light beaming out of it, i guess, and rotate around it to one side. my brother also saw a star turn into 2 smaller lights and fly off in two different directions. just like i did a couple months ago. they don't know what to think, but i do. i told them all they have to do is really look. otherwise at a glance, you will think these are stars. ufo's are over huthinson\r\ndisguised as stars. there is no other explanation for the activity that i have seen around here fairly steadily since last year.\r\ni really think you guys should come down here with a telescope hooked to a lap top and spend a couple nights checking this crazy stuff out.\r\ni'm sorry i don't

southbound on edmonds ln between sh3040 and sh121. i was ultimately headed toward grapevine, texas to sing karaoke at a local venue.  i really wish that i could have taken a pic of the event, but it happened rather quickly, and i was riding my harley at the time.\r\n\r\nplease understand that i reside in the flight-path for dfw airport, and am quite familiar with landing aircraft at dfw.  the light i saw was bright white, and too large to be a commercial airliner.  additionally, wind current at dfw is typically from the south as it was on that evening, and the typical aircraft approach to dfw is from the north.  the bright light i saw reminded me of a \"shooting star\" in speed, but it certainly was not that either. it was going entirely too fast to be a commercial airliner.\r\n\r\nwhat truly surprised me the most, was that during that \"moment\", i noticed that an arriving aircraft was in the \"pattern\" for dfw airport. that arriving flight was forced to take an \"evasive action\" on approach for dfw airport to avoid collision with the flying object (moving east to west). i noticed the approaching flight make a swift adjustment to it's right while lifting it's right wing abruptly to avoid collision.\r\n\r\nthen i noticed the \"unknown to me object\" continue traveling to the west over the horizon. the one thing i noticed about the assumed ufo is that it was mostly a very fast white light that seemed to arc over the western horizon.  the light was so intense, and the speed of the object was so fast that it appeared to have a \"light trail\".  i know for fact that it was not \"space junk\" re-entering our atmosphere, and it was not the right color to be a meteor.\r\n\r\nas i continued my travels onto sh121 heading west toward grapevine, i kept looking to my west looking for some kind of \"crash event\". possibly like an explosion or police activity. but, i didn't see anything further to indicate that something had gone wrong.\r\n\r\nit was just weird! i cannot say that it was an \"orb\", or that it had any particular shape to it.  however, if it had been a \"falling object\" from our skies, i still believe that there would have been some type of fire or explosion event that would have been noticeable in my travels to the west. that is what leaves me with the impression that it was some \"type\" of controlled flying object.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

vegas and out route put us on route 375. we were completely unaware of the significants of this road at the time. as were driving in the distance beyond the ridge line we began to see flashes of light, similar to a transformer blowing up. however the flashes were emitting a light much brighter than a blown transformer and the flashes were coming from different parts of the ridge rather then one select area. i thought i might have been heat lighting, but there were not clouds or heat to justify such a conclusion. plus the light was grounded rather than airborne. we exited the car to try to see what was going on. i looked to my left and in the corner ridge maybe a mile away i saw a red beam of light head directly towards the grown at a rapid speed and then begin to expand as it got closer to the ground. then it disappeared as fast it appeared. i thought nothing of it at the time because i am not going to jump and say something is not of this world when it was close enough or seen long enough to scare me into believing it was something of significants. then my friend tapped me on the shoulder and pointed at a bright white beam of light heading towards the ground then curve south east. the light was maybe 300 yards away and as it got closer to the ground it began to expand just like the red beam. but then a blue circular mass appeared. i can't say it was a ball of light or a gas because thought it was not clearly defined in sense of having sharp edges but it had blurred definition but the light was contained in a shape without a doubt. then within the blue light what looked like small bolts of lighting began to appear but were contained without the light it self. then as it got closer to the ground a solid dark object appeared at the based of the light with 10 to 12 red lights at the based of the object. the mass was maybe 300 years away.  all masses began to slow down. we could feel the pressure of the object and we had the sense the air was electrified but there was no noise what so ever. we quickly got into the car and drove to where we were staying. i did research the next day and quickly realized we were right next to groom lake and wondered if what we saw was what i dared not mention. i have lived many places. including next to the air force base in burlington vt. i have seen war games done by the government and i have seen flares and black hawks fly in odd formations during simulations. i have lived next to the submarine base and coast guard academy, i know what military lights on aircrafts and vehicles look like and how they can be mistaken for something they are not.  this was nothing i have seen, there was zero explanation. if i had to say what it was. i would say it was an object deciding out of a highly active particle mass.
