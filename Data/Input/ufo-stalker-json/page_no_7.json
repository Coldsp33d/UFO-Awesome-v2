the wife , child and her parents all took off to play in montana , while i was left doing the farm work. only my wife's grandmother and myself where on the farm that evening.My cat , dog and myself where alone in our home , old grandma was 500' away in her home,...With her dog .I must have fell asleep on the couch at around 10:30 p.M., cat and dog laying on the living room floor next to me. tv was on...Of course and suddenly i felt my name being called and a strong urge to head out the back door . i cleary remember turning to look at my pets , who were eating at their feeding station , next to the front door.Now the backdoor was only a few feet past the living , so outside i went , took about 6 steps ,...No porch , just lawn.And felt the lightest warmth of stalled air , i have ever known.There to my surprise , lay my neighbors breeding dogs , whom were ever and always locked in their kennel,...They were not free roaming farm-dogs .Than i heard and felt the hum,....Very quiet.I looked up and directly above me half the cloudless sky seemed to be enveloped in a pulsing , mist-like , translucent mist , but the stars were still visible through it,...Barely now knowing the length , distance and exact dimensions of our valley , i was in awe when it struck me how big this mist , vaporous area above my head was . now it was than i could clearly see this thing had straight lines in fact this thing , mist was \" translucent \". here are the dimensions of this , what i could cleary see was a giant triangle ,...I mean giant craft best estimates well over a half-mile in length on equal sides. in the center a darker mass was blocking out the stars and on the three tips each having a dim oranges pulsing dome , yet the stars could still be seen or perhaps it was meant to appear that way,......Wish i had that camo for hunting.Now i know aircraft quite well and my first thought was \" wow , i'm here ,,...Me , i'm looking at that aurora project.Oh hell no....This thing is way !%#@&**!! bigger .\" is this for real ?, why am i seeing this ?Why are my neighbors dogs in my yard ? and that's when i saw my dog sitting about 35' away next to the wood-shed . my dog is black and friendly , but she was just sitting there not with my neighbor dogs.Here's the weird thing , all the dogs were lying with their heads to the north , they were a foot apart and their legs were lying directly west....How's that for sleeping placement.Suddenly all the dogs looked up at me or tried , but were having problems moving .I was still in awe staring at this craft above me when i felt the temp in the air drop about 30 degrees and this massive craft began moving up and heading west . i watched it go away at about 3 mph ....No hurry than it was over the next hill.I heard a crash and spun to see my dog running off and as i tried heading towards her i felt sick , like i was spinning .I made it to the backdoor and dove for the couch.I opened my eyes the clock was at 1:38 a.M. and my dog & cat were sitting by the front door whinning to go out.I let them out than went to the back door opened it and now my dog was playing with the neighbors dogs , who all seemed to be having fun.These are the basics of that event to be blunt oh i might add grandma said she couldn't sleep that night and her old dog was bouncing all over the house.I went back to the couch and woke up feeling sick at 6:00 a.M. and for 3 days after , everything tasted strange ,....Oh and liquids all tasted like grape soda . there is more that began to occur after this event , but i only wish to describe this first sighting .","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

different when you have an experience with these flying objects. i ruled out that it was a plane because it was so low, i should have heard it right? no sound. i also thought it could be the overhead room playing a trick with the window, but i moved around in every possible position trying to see this \"reflection\" again but it wasn't happening. it was also very fast and traveled in a straight line, no wavering to be seen. i have never seen such a fast, smooth, and silent aircraft, it simply couldn't have been that. i didn't see / can't recall the exact shape of the object, mainly because it is late at night here. i only saw the light that looked like a flat disk but with a concentration in the center. keep in mind this event lasted 2 or less seconds, as it entered my field of view to disappearing oner the mountains. just now a plane flew by, heading from e to w quite a ways away and i can hear its typical whir as it passes. it also has its flashing white and red lights to signify it as a plane. the object i saw didn't have those lights, and didn't make a sound. i am pretty spooked to tell you the

and each others company, we notice a grayish silver disk shape object in the sky small yet big enough to barely see it had windows all around the edge.  we thought it was a strange object we had never seen before.  the strangest thing about the object was every time i would jump from one side to the other goofing off as young people sometimes do the object would do the same in the sky.  awkward enough, we felt we were being watched so we went in our house.  forgetting about the incident we went to bed that evening just at dark and my sister and i slept in the same bed in the front bedroom.  we were talking when we suddenly heard horse hoofs running really fast and loud and stopped right at our bedroom windows and bright lights going around and around flashing through our heavy curtains.  we were so scared we covered our head up with our blanket and next thing i know some one was whispering my first name over and over until i peaked out from under my blanket and saw a gray flaky skin male with big grayish black eyes barely taller then my bed at least 3 to 4 ft tall saying my first name through telepathy sounded like a boys voice his head was big like an egg shape pin holes for a nose and mouth and no ears and no genitals or anything. i dont know where he took me, it seems like i saw some others but i dont know cant remember right now but i wish i could: early the next morning my sister asked me where was i all night but i was in a daze and i still not sure so we went on to school that morning while walking to school bus stop the army men was picking up purple bone throwing them in army truck and men in black suits and big fancy black car starred and frowned at me until i stopped watching them. i was in high school at the time so i put my head down and went to school.

a faster rate, and being the believers we are in ufos and e.T.S, my mother said to get into the house due to fear of being abducted or something. 3 mins later we returned outside to throw something away (this was out front, but we could still see the area it was sighted). we didn't see it after that point.

crew had spent the day gutting it; tossing everything into a large construction dumpster. \r\nwe had planned that when i got home from work at about 6:30, we were gonna go see what was in there. we walked around to the back talking about the history of the building. i was admiring the architecture of the building and we arrived at the dumpster. there was only one ladder leading up the side of the dumpster and my neighbor jumped on it. i complained and he said that i get to be the lookout.\r\nso i'm examining the building's original entrance, which was on the second floor when i noticed security cameras up in the eaves. \r\njust then a bird caught my eye. it was in mid turn, with its wings at a 45 degree angle against the horizon. strange that it wasn't righting itself like a bird would. i quickly calculated its distance at a quarter mile out and 350 feet up and realized that it would have to be a very large bird. \r\njust then it popped into a more compact shape and i yelled ufo! i yelled to my neighbor to get down here and check this out. as he started down the ladder i thought about running across the street and grabbing my new sony camera, but then realized that as fast as it was going that it would overtake me by the time i reached my front yard. \r\nso i thought oh well, i'll just use my cellphone's camera and i reached for it on my belt when my neighbor arrived to stand next to me and we watched. before i could pull it off my belt i had four distinct thoughts: this is all commonplace. there is nothing extraordinary happening here. everyone believes in ufos. soon this will be happening all the time. \r\nthen it was on top of us. about 30 feet above. i could see clearly the bottom of the craft. there were pipes running this way and that way. it was all a dull gray color and completely unaerodynamic as it flew. it was taller than it was wide and wider than it was long. picture a giant gray cigarette pack flying (very well) with the cigarettes perpendicular to the horizon. it was about 60 feet tall, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet long. there were no windows. it was completely silent. it left zero wake. as fast as it was coming at us and as close as it flew over us and as much air that it should have been pushing, we should have been knocked down, but nothing, not even a breeze. \r\nwe both turned around to watch it gain altitude and clear my house. when it had, something popped out of the lower right of the ship, like a rudder, which caused it to abruptly turn left. the opposite of how you would expect for a rudder to function. \r\nand then it was gone. i said wow, to my neighbor, that was amazing. can you believe it? i started reviewing the facts with him and he says that he wishes to someday see a ufo like what i have seen. what?!? dude, we have both just experienced one of the coolest daytime sightings ever. he said no, that was a helicopter. the kind with two rotors. so i ask him didn't he see how the thing was flying. if that was a chinook helicopter it would have had to be flying with it's nose almost on the ground and with its rotors facing forward, which would be impossible. he says he couldn't be sure as he didn't have his glasses on. i reminded him that it was only 30 feet away and completely silent too. he says well, you know they have these special rotor blades now. so i explained to him the difference between noise-dampened and silent. \r\ni went home confused. the next day at work i'm telling everyone \"yeah, so i saw one of them ufos again last night. blah blah blah. i still thought everyone believed in ufos. it took me a little over two days to realize that those were not my thoughts when i opened up a huffington post and read that only five % of the population believe in them. \r\ni've spent a lot of time analyzing what had happened only to just come up with the questions about it, no answers, only guesses. \r\nit was still daylight. why didn't they wait until dark? \r\ndidn't anybody else see it? \r\ndid it appear as a chinook to everyone else? \r\nit was already turning towards me when i had first seen it. what was its purpose for flying so low right above me? \r\nit being so blatant, why did it not want its picture taken?\r\nthis was not the first time i had been singled out by a ufo. the first time was on the other side of the continent, separated by many years, entailed multiple visits spanning several months, contained contact, and missing time of two hours, but completely different ships. \r\nconnected or coincidence?","distance":"21-100
