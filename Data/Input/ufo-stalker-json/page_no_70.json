driver) and i were traveling westbound on i-80 towards san fransisco on our way to work. while passing the area of vacaville i noticed an object hovering over a hilltop in the distance. the size of the object would be about the size of an aspirin if held at arms length. it was cylindrically shaped (oriented vertically) it appeared larger at the top. the object was dark gray-black. it was very pronounced against a clear sky background. i saw the object intermittently as my line of sight was disrupted by traffic in the lane next to mine and an overpass that we drove under. for me, the event lasted somewhere between 1-3 minutes. i say it that way because i didn't see the object \"arrive\" and i didn't see it leave. so i can't say for sure how long it was there. \r\n\r\nduring the periods that i had a direct line of sight to the object i could tell that while stationary it was either rotating around its y axis or changing shape. the larger part on top seemed to alternate between being on the left and right side of the object. \r\n\r\nthe weather conditions during this event were relatively clear with very little cloud coverage. i would describe it as a bright and sunny california winter morning. \r\n\r\ni'm not sure what made me first notice the object, but as soon as i did my mind classified it was \"odd.\" i drive that route several times a week and am very familiar with the aircraft in that area. travis air force base is only about 15 miles from where this event took place, so seeing military air craft as well as commercial aircraft is extremely common. along with airplanes and helicopters regularly seen in the area, its also quite common to see hot air balloons. in fact the first prosaic explanation that came to mind was a hot air balloon, but thats just not what i saw. first of all its out of season for for hot air balloons in that area. usually when you see them, theres always several hot air balloons together. hot air balloons are generally brightly colored, this was almost black, and it's shape wasn't correct to be a hot air ballon. the next explanation i came up with was one of those balloons that you would see above a car dealership or a new housing development. this however doesn't seem plausible because for one, that particular hilltop doesn't really have any buildings other then a few homes. for another, the size of the thing from the distance i saw it means it had to be much larger then an advertising balloon.  \r\n\r\nseeing this object was exciting for me. full disclosure, i'm a ufo enthusiast. i generally keep an eye to the sky in hopes of seeing something of high strangeness. until now i've never seen anything that couldn't immediately be explained. i tried my best to take photos and video with my phone but it just wasn't large enough for my phone to capture it. my coworker also saw the object and acknowledged that it was indeed strange. he too said that it didn't look like \"any hot aid balloon he had ever seen.\" \r\n\r\ni eventually lost sight of the object when we got close enough to the hills to block my view. i continued to look in the direction that i thought it may be the rest of the way to san fransisco. \r\n","distance":"Over One

december 22, 2017 was like the past couple night, cold, crisp and very clear skies. where i live in the northwest of british columbia is a very open sky with little natural lights on parts of the route we drive making for the starry skies to be very illuminecscent. i enjoy looking up when i can and always observe as much as i can as its truly a beautiful spectacle. last night the moon was about under half full, very clear skies. not a single could to be seen all evening. well coming back along the route where iheres no natural light for abit, i noticed a clouded orb like light off to right of the moon. now that’s just from the direction i was headed at the time. as i noticed this weird oddity, it then by perspective shot out a smoke ring.As the ring grew larger the clouded light got farther away. the smoke wasn’t heavy or thick in anyway. thin like. but as i continued down the road and the angle changed to where i lost sight of the lighted misty cloud like object i could see see the ring still. after passing by the trees everything was gone. this was over about a 4 minute  time period. now i’m a rational person, my thoughts were the ring was rested by propulsion. only thing is what was the clouded object that caused this? looking for some science, logic and rational reasoning here for a possible answer. thanks for listening/reading ","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

\r\nmy friends and i were sitting on their patio on the hotel late one night after their wedding. one friend happened to notice a small red light/object in the sky. as we looked, it started to grow bigger. appearing to look like lava starting to flow from a volcano (no volcanos near by, however). it grew bigger slowly before disappearing suddenly, then again reappearing suddenly and staying in a half moon type shape for at least 5 minutes. the picture at night that is included was taken off of my phone (iphone 6). it doesn’t capture the true color, which looked a lot more firey, but the shape is almost accurate. it wasn’t perfectly smooth, as mentioned before it looked like lava had begun pouring down the side of a volcano but stopped just at the top in a half moon like shape. i also added another photo i had taken earlier that day in the exact same spot as a reference. there were no buildings or ships that could’ve possibly caused that light to be there. it also shows it was quite high up. i am not sure the exact location, if it was north or south, but the moon that night was the opposite side of the sky to this object, so it would not have been the moon. \r\nafter about 5 minutes, the object suddenly disappeared again, but didnnot return this time and we never saw the object again. it caused us no feelings other than confusion and a bit of fear as we had, and still have, no idea what we saw that night.
