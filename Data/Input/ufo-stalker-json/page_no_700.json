at !0,000 feet and south of my position.\r\n2) i saw a perfectly round object move from left to right that looked like a shadow moving between the cloud and sun. i saw the second object because i was still trying to figure out what the first one was and where it went.\r\n3) at first, i thought it was a bird, but i couldn't figure out what bird would have a perfectly round shape and move/glide like that. then i thought it might be a plane but there was no sound. about 20 seconds later, i saw another object that looked and moved like the first one. in between sightings of the 2 objects i noticed a silver large passenger plane at 30,000 feet moving north to south far up to the right of the cloud in an area where there were no clouds.\r\n4) the object looked like a perfectly round shadow moving quickly from left(southeast) to right(southwest) between the cumulus cloud and the sun. it made no noise and vanished/ blended in with the sky after it exited the cloud. since the object puzzled me so, i continued looking at the sky and cloud and about 30 seconds later, i saw another object that had the same shape and moved in the same direction as the first one. when that object passed from behind the cloud it also became invisible/blended with the sky. both objects were not visible to my eye before entering the cloud as well. they moved at the same height and speed and in a straight path.\r\n5) after seeing the first object and expecting to see a bird or plane emerge from the cloud and not seeing anything, i was stunned. i kept saying \"what?\", \"what?\" out loud because i couldn't understand what i had seen. this is why i kept looking at the cloud. i didn't move from my chair. then after 20 seconds, the same object appeared again and i decided that i had try to comprehend what i was seeing. when nothing appeared again after the object left the cloud i stood up out of my chair and looked at the sky more closely it was totally invisible. i looked at my watch to make sure that i remembered the exact time it happened. i thought i just saw 2 ufos and didn't know what to do. i came inside and told my 22 year old son and my 20 year old daughter what i saw. i can't get the vision of those 2 objects moving behind the cloud out of my head! i thought of calling the faa, philadelphia international airport and even our local news but i was afraid of ridicule. i posted a question if any of my local friends on facebook might have been looking at that cloud at that time, but nobody did. i hope that someone else saw them to confirm what i saw.\r\n6) they

room watching a movie with my elderly father who had early stage dementia at the time.\r\n\r\nthe first time this happened, my father called me out to the top of the steps leading to our front door and asked me to look up in the sky.  this would usually happen around 8pm local time and last up to 15 minutes, so we would often go out around that time when most of the night sky was visible in our rural, outback queensland area to watch \"the spacecraft.\"\r\n\r\nthere appeared to be extraordinarly fast moving, glowing, star-like (but brighter) objects going across the sky.  they would sometimes move across the sky, with no known intereference or sound, and appeared to be well out of earth's orbit.  if i could put two fingers up and try to measure the comparative speed of the objects, to ordinary planes and jet fighters for example (not knowing exactly how large they were, or how far out they were) i estimated they moved across the sky (no light noise, everything possibly visible to the eye was visible) about half inch/sec.  they were way out, whatever they were.  and fast.\r\n\r\nmost of the time others would follow, half the time several would follow and appeared to be circling the local solar system.  sometimes they would appear from a very long distance away, in an arc around the entire solar system (or way out from earth), accelerate and then just disappear.\r\n\r\nthey were definitely not planes, helicopters, or anything i could identify.\r\n\r\nthere were no visible parts of the objects like windows or other identifiable characteristics, and in any case were bright white-like lights, star-like but not stars, and manouvered strangely on occasion.  there were often more than one, 9/10 times, followed each other, and would sometimes accelerate rapidly in an arc-like manner around what seemed to be the solar system (or just a significant distance from earth) and just disappear into the distance.\r\n\r\nwe did not feel anything strange.  we just watched, tried to identify what these things were, and talked about the high probability that advanced civilizations existed elsewhere in the universe.  nobody else around our little town seemed to notice.  while we had stills cameras and a small video camera, we didn't feel any urge to get evidence, and in fact i do not think the idea ever entered our minds.\r\n\r\nwe had the distinct feeling that this was it, 1) that we had the final proof we needed to make up our minds on whether spacecraft from elsewhere were visiting and observing, 2) that the universe probably contained innumerable other life-forms out there, and 3) a good enough proportion of them advanced technological civilizations, and given enough time to evolve and avoid destroying each other etc, would probably come across us on earth at some stage.\r\n\r\nwe would watch them eventually go out of sight, or simply accelerate and disappear, and go back inside.  it became an ordinary almost everyday experience for us.\r\n\r\nmost of the time we lost sight simply because they would accelerate and disappear (seemingly off into the galaxy or further away) or would travel across the sky and eventually out of sight.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

i know when they would come to use me or take me. then i felt relaxed and think i slept for about 20 minutes. then i was awakened again. i felt very groggy but aware. immediately i felt my right side and navel for pain and cuts. then i was aware i was being watched. i looked over to my bedroom doorway and saw a tall being standing there. i had seen him many times before. he's my handler and works with me. he told me telepathically that the procedure was over. they got what they came for- my egg. and then he thanked me for continuing to work with them. he also told me that they will let me know

a half moon. i was amazed and ran into the house and woke my wife up to tell her what i had just seen and showed her the video. it is not a great video, it's turned sideways and you can't see the

hand day after it happened re turned black at fingertips. i went to er, they did many hours of surgery but couldn't resolve blood flow and lost parts of my right hand and have had 5 surgeries.  my hand is still very deformed,i was then diagnosed with a very rare form of lupus it took over 6 months to come up with a diagnosis. i grew up on a farm,we had beefcake.  i saw something on tv about cattle mutations,we had several my grandfather was actually scared.  my grandpa was in the war shooting till his ears bled, he saw 2 of his brothers die,he was a very difficult man and had never seen him scared,he made me run into the house,which the amish own now,my grandparents are gone and i was young, 7 or 8.\r\nanyway i'm writing because when i had this connection with this light,i saw the cows and saw they were using organs to finish development of very small fetuses.\r\nalso there are enormous underground cities. there are human and alien species preparing these cities. it's not just tunnels where people can survive a month,they are large cities,with flat small dwellings. hundreds of thousands of dwellings for humans to live,as well as certain aliens.  there are groceries produced,travel from place to place by magnetic subways,theaters,zoos,sewage,it is a place planned for dwelling for over 20 years.  they are preparing for the planet above ground to be uninhabitable. it's soon,but i won't be there,my youngest son will.  there will be people that do all jobs from entertaining to scientists.  they are going to take the best people able to contribute.  many people that are scientology people are aware of much of this there are many masons aware and many fdl or whatever they are aware.  the people of government ,most rant aware and most won't go.  they are able to do this with alien technology working underground with humans,deep.  they are all over and in u.S. they are everywhere but where there are 4 places the u.S. will move underground. these places are all connected and they have different companies doing different things so no one is aware of the whole. they have air they make,water they make,much is stored,they have waste places,but mostly everything is biodegradable,and reusable. everything has a purpose.  this is when people will join a couple races of aliens.  when it's time to emerge,people's dna will be changed ,there will be no disease,animals will be reproduced,whatever caused the earth to be uninhabitable will be gone.  earth will be one at peace without disease over 1000 years. the people going there won't know until they are taken there and everyone has a purpose.\r\ni am anonymous in the beginning for fear of being deemed crazy,i am now anonymous for fear of being followed and harm coming to me.  i suffered a great deal of physical damage learning all the information i did,the only reason i can think i got this information is because i was to see my youngest son there,and make sure he learns what he needs to,but he is going to be very useful.  he's a very different child,very smart but introverted to an extreme. also they have many crafts but they travel using some sort of magnetism and electricity already in space from planets running into each other and dying.  old monoliths were put there so they would be aware of how,when,and where to travel based on when the stars going to die and they need that energy and passage.  i learned nothing growing up about these things,but experiences i've had helped me understand what i was being told. i apologize i can't be open publicly with this information,but it is impossible for many reasons.  i'm not sure if i'm supposed to be saying this at all,but the need is to great not to.  there is so much more,and so much people don't know,i'm sure there's much i don't know. the times i reported are not right but the time recollection is gone.  i can only go by my first operation on my hand that was under the light. there is no need to contact me,i'm currently going through very difficult times.  my husband was a police detective for 25 years. the highest decorated in our county.  but he woke up without his memory and doctors don't know why.  he couldn't remember a refrigerator or even his sister's.  he lost his job and since it isn't a work related incident,he's making no money,i make $700 a month from veteran disability.  we have had utilities shut off,no way to pay bills and don't know how to care for my son and husband of 23 years.  so right now, that obviously is consuming all my time. our house was foreclosed and i'm not allowed to work.  i must use all my energy trying to get through this.  two years ago we made $70,000 a year and had everything we needed.\r\ni hope this information helps someone,somehow.\r\nthank you for your

home.  clear night, bright stars in sky, bright crescent moon.  all were taking in the stars.  \r\nat 10:10pm an odd light appeared in sky, west of the moon, traveling north, about 55 degrees from horizon. at first i thought is was a shooting star, very bright and thick shooting star.  but the light looked like a 'line', as if 8 or 10 stars were connected vertically and never changed in length and did not have a trail and did not fade.  it was traveling at a steady pace, north in the sky, at the speed of a plane.  we considered whether it might be a plane, but the steady rocking of 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock of the line of light, combined with it changing from a solid line to a series of 5 dots of light in a row (like 5 stars were traveling in line together), back to a solid line, then to a shorter line with one dot of light at the back, then 5 lights, then a solid line, while continually rocking from 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock made us consider it was something else. we had a set of binoculars on the table from watching birds in the afternoon, and i continued to watch the event through the binoculars while my 3 friends watched with their naked eyes.  (we are two high level scientists and administrators at universities, plus an artist and myself).  \r\n\r\nwhen the light finally slowed and then settled as if a stationary star, another beam of light appeared along side it and then mimicked the same behavior (northward movement at the speed of an airplane, rocking from 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock, changed form from a solid line to a line of lights and back, with different combinations of the length of the line and the number of single lights).  this ended at 10:16pm.  this beam of light did not stop as a star but slowly faded, as if getting farther and farther from the earth's surface.  the other star (last scene movement of the first beam) remained in the sky and didn't move.\r\n\r\nwe were all discussing whether this was a set of ufos, and truly analyzed the sighting as it was happening: size, path, pattern, time of night.  we compared it to planes actually flying overhead (flashing light with one red and other white, flying horizontally in sky not vertically north) and looked carefully through the binoculars.  we agreed that in all our 57 years of life (we are all close to the same age) no one has ever scene a pattern of light like this in the sky.  we were convinced this wasn't a plane.

public record.  the following was copied from a public website. william i. mcneff) early in the morning of 24 october 1968, oscar-flight security controller staff sgt. william smith received a report from a camper team posted at the launch facility (lf) designated oscar-6 (o-6). according to smith, the team was providing aboveground security for a target alignment team working underground in the missile silo when they observed a large glowing object that \"went down by some trees not far away.\"[3] shortly after, at 2:30 a.M., a missile maintenance team of airman first class robert o'connor and a1c lloyd isley were en route to the november-7 (n-7) launch facility when they reported an unusual light in the east to base operations. the strange light appeared to be pacing their vehicle while growing brighter. by the time they arrived at n-7, the bright ufo had taken up a position circling to the south.[4]\r\nin response, the base operations dispatcher patched in the observers at n-7 with the ground controllers at radar approach control (rapcon), established an open-line for reporting, and kept a log of the ufo activity over the next two hours. soon, flight security controllers (fsc) — the officers responsible for the security requirements at the launch control facilities (lcf) — were also reporting sightings via their communications network linked to missile wing security control (wsc).\r\nin one instance, security personnel at three of the lcfs similarly described “the object separate in two parts and go in opposite directions and return and pass under each other.”[5] in another, a fsc reported that an “object which looked to him as the sun” came near the hardened antenna within the security fencing of his lcf. it then moved away and he dispatched his two-man security alert team (sat), who followed the object to within a half-mile of where it appeared to be landing. when the object reached the ground the light dimmed and extinguished. after this, they could see nothing.[6] independent reports mutually described a very large, brightly illuminated aerial object that would alternate colors from brilliant white to amber and green, with an ability to hover, accelerate rapidly and abruptly change direction.[7]\r\nb-52 air-radar observations\r\nat about 3:00 a.M., a b-52h stratofortress returned to minot afb from a routine 10-hour training mission. the pilots practiced high-altitude instrumented procedures and approaches to the runway, eventually requesting clearance to fly out to the tactical air navigation (tacan) initial approach fix (“wt fix”), 35 nautical miles northwest of the airbase. given clearance to flight level 200 (20,000 feet altitude), rapcon ground controllers then asked the crew to “look out toward your 1:00 [one o’clock] position for the next 15 or 16 miles and see if you see any orange glows out there. somebody is seeing flying saucers again.”[8]\r\nthe b-52 crew observed nothing out of the ordinary during the flight out. approaching the wt fix, they initiated a standard 180-degree turnaround that would eventually bring them back over the wt fix on a straight approach to the runway. at 3:52, as they started the wide turn, ground controllers informed the crew “the ufo is being picked up by the weathers [sic] radar also, should be your 1:00 position 3 miles now.”[9]\r\nthe b-52’s own radar detected the radar return (ufo) co-altitude at three miles away, sparking air safety concerns among the crew. however, as the b-52 banked around the roughly 6-mile diameter turn the ufo maintained a constant three-mile separation, moving to the northeast — outside of the turn radius and to the left of the b-52 as it finally rolled out.\r\nupon clearing the wt fix to begin the descent back to the runway, the radar return suddenly changed position. in one sweep of the radar — less than three seconds — the ufo appeared to close distance to one mile, while subsequent sweeps would indicate that the return was matching the forward velocity of the b-52. the seemingly phenomenal and instantaneous movement of the ufo startled b-52 navigator captain patrick mccaslin:\r\ni knew whatever it was that there was something there that i’d never seen on radar. i don’t know of anything that could go laterally in three seconds, two miles, and just stop. it was maintaining our descent rate, and then just laterally to one mile… perfect formation.[10]\r\nat the same instant as the return’s abrupt change of position, the b-52’s two uhf radios ceased transmission on all frequencies with rapcon. the ufo continued pacing the aircraft off the left wing for nearly 20 miles. near the end of the descent trajectory, the radarscope camera filmed the ufo as it appeared to spiral around behind the b-52, after which the radar return disappeared and radio communications returned to normal.[11]\r\nfollowing the inexplicable radar encounter, the b-52 pilots practiced a missed approach to the runway and were vectored back around to land. however, on final approach to the runway a general officer radioed a request not to land, but to continue around in order to fly over and photograph the object if possible.[12] accordingly, rapcon controllers vectored the b-52 once again onto the traffic pattern, to the location of a stationary ufo on or near the ground, roughly 16 miles north-northwest of the airbase. immediately after turning onto the downwind leg of the pattern, both pilots observed an illuminated object more than 10 miles ahead of the aircraft. the non-crew pilot major james partin compared the ufo to “a miniature sun placed on the ground below the aircraft.”[13]\r\npartial scan of minot afb investigating officer col. werlich’s overlay map showing the flight track of the b-52 around the first traffic pattern. werlich did not plot the second extended go-around when the pilots observed and overflew the ufo. he does nevertheless indicate the location of the b-52 during the pilot’s “first visual sighting,” following the turn onto the downwind leg of the pattern, and “probable area of aircrew ground sighting” in the rectangular box (werlich overlay map).\r\nupon reaching the object the b-52 flew alongside and executed a left turn over and around it. as the b-52 banked over the object, copilot capt. bradford runyon was able to observe the ufo through the pilot’s window as it passed beneath the aircraft. he described a huge egg-shaped object with a surface that appeared to give off a dull reddish color like molten steel. as they began the turn, he noticed a smooth metallic tubular section extending horizontally from the long-end of the elliptical object, connecting to the mid-point of a curved crescent-shaped protuberance, not unlike a bumper. this section encompassed the width of the body and emanated a greenish-yellow glow from its interior back, illuminating the tubular section and the front of the egg-shaped main body of the object. once again, their radios would not transmit during the very close approach.[14]\r\nthe b-52 turned left onto the base leg of the traffic pattern and lost sight of the ufo. they continued around to the runway at minot afb and came to a terminal landing at 4:40 a.M. at 4:49, both the outer and inner-zone security alarms sounded at the missile launch facility oscar-7, and ssgt. smith immediately dispatched his security alert team to investigate. the team discovered the front gate unpadlocked, and an access hatch on site standing open, but no other evidence of intruders. in the meantime, november security personnel continued reporting a ufo west of n-7, until the light gradually diminished around 5:30.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

next. this alternated as it strode infront of us.\r\n\r\nit smiled at us and appeared to be waveing. i wasn't prepared for this and seeing it froze me in fear. the entity was a bi-ped that stood taller than me at 5\"10. it was compleatly naked. though no genitalia could be seen. where human genitals should have been there appeared to be nothing there, as you would imagin a doll would look. its skin was a dark greyish color. it had very small black eyes which reflected the moonlight. it's ears were tight against its head, the ears came to a point.\r\nthe jaw was bigger than any humans. the jaw line went all the way up the sides of its head as if it's smile stared behind its ears almost. rows of sharp white teeth were visible as it smiled at us. it had slits for a nose that were slightly flared at the top. i can't remember how many fingers it had but it definitly had digits that it held up as it waved. the encounter lasted all but a few minutes. the instant i was able i twisted my wifes arm and i grabed hold of her wrist. i'm twice my wifes size with a very athletic build. i ran at top speed literaly draging her in the dirt through the leaves out of the grove up the grass hill through the soccer feild and into the street.\r\nas we reached the street i noticed my wife was yelling and screaming at me to stop, and go back, go back she said. as she badly wanted to make contact with the entity.\r\n\r\nbut my fear over powered me and i dragged us both into the house. from our door step we could see the grove of trees. i immediatly said don't say anything! as i didn't want our testomonials to become tainted with any kind of suggestion from one another. i seperated us into different rooms and had us write down our testamonials of what we saw. \r\n\r\nto no suprise we both described the same entity with the same features.\r\n\r\n this event has effected my life very negativly, as my family thinks my wife and i made it up or are just plain lieing to get attention or something. \r\nnot knowing what this entity was keeps me up many nights. i must have thought about every possibility pheasable. i though could it have been a spirit, a human in hollywood style movie make up, mabey a scoobydoo type hologram projecter, or even an alien. to this day not knowing eats at the back of my mind. \r\ni fully know aliens exist. with the vastness of space and the countless stars in the universe it becomes clear that we can not possibly be the only life.\r\n\r\neven know i can feel my heart raceing as i recall the event. did i miss out on a one in a billion chance to possibly communicate with another intelligent life form? i only have one regret in my life, and that regret is not going back to find out for sure what it was.\r\n\r\nif were ever going to communicate with beings like this (if indeed it was one) we need to have love at the center of our awarness, so we don't flee in fear for no reason.\r\n\r\nfor along time i never told anyone but my closest friends and my immediate family for fear that people would think we were crazy. but its come to a point that this itch in the back of my brain has gotten so bad i feel it nessecary to tell others of what we saw. i've become so obsessed with searching the web for possible information on the existance of alien life that i often spend hours of my time sifting through garbage on the internet just trying to find someone somewhere who has seen an entity like the one we saw.\r\n\r\ni'm currently attending a trade school for an hvacr program, and in less than one year i'm going to have my epa 3 certification so i can handle refrigerants. i am not crazy.","distance":"20 Feet or

was a dark, clear, a bit windy night, no clouds in the sky, just after 10pm, i was watching a show (included fire) outside, on the streets of the village, when i decided to look up. i could see the stars clearly and with them a bright orange ball, bigger than the stars and definitely not part of the fire/fireworks because i could see it was very bright and very high up (like the planes). it produced no noise, no one else noticed it (i think). it just stayed there and then produced a new ball (same colour, size) without changing it's own size in the process (unlike the cellular division). the new ball went a bit down and to the left of the first one. a couple of seconds later, they disappeared.\r\ni've seen similar stuff on other videos of ufo's. at first i thought it was a star, but it was too big. i know it wasn't a helicopter, because they look different, too. i was amazed and a bit scared, but only because i realised that i was seeing something very new.\r\ni usually wear glasses, and i was doing so at the time. i know it wasn't an optical illusion of the street lights or something because the balls were very bright! like the stars
