one friend and i saw two separate red pulsating objects in the sky, off to the east, we confirmed with each other we were not seeing fireworks or flare guns, we sat outside, watched these lights travel the sky east to west, ascend and descend, the two lights would be far apart in the sky, one off to the west and one to the east and then within seconds they were right back next to each other in the sky. it could best be described as playing a game or tag, there was obvious communication between the two objects due to their travel patterns. my friend and i walked to the gas station, talked about what we were seeing, firmly both agree they were in fact ufo's, i personally do not know of technology that would allow the travel patterns we witnessed, they could not have been fireworks, we were watching fireworks across the sky all night and comparing the fireworks to the crafts side by side in the sky. it appeared that time was manipulated, it appeared as though the crafts were able to travel from one side of us far in the sky to another side, appeared to be a very long distance in a very short amount of time. the size of the crafts appeared equal, both maybe a penny or between penny and quarter held up to the sky. they appeared closer or bigger than stars in the sky and would only stop moving for seconds, constant movement. i first noticed the objects because i was outside at a 4th of july party and staring into the sky watching fireworks but off to the left in my vision i kept seeing these red lights that were not acting the same as fireworks. i asked a friend present at the party if he would take a minute to see what i was seeing, we talked and observed the objects for what felt like hours. i would say the time frame was between 10 pm and 4 am. it was well after sunset pitch black sky but before the sunrise on the horizon. pacific timezone. i felt overwhelmed at first, among 10 or so people present only myself and 1 other will go on record saying what we say was 2 ufo's, the others present were too occupied with drinking, eating, conversing, playing outdoor games, overall celebrating the 4th of july. all i had to do was take 10 minutes, take a deep breathe and really absorb the information my brain was perceiving. there were no explanations for what i saw and every time i tell this story and someone discounts me saying, maybe it was fireworks, maybe it was a plane, maybe it was a flare, maybe, maybe maybe... they did not see what i saw and there is no way to convince people to perceive the information in the same way i did, without personal experiences some people will not be able or willing to understand what i am telling them/you. my fear disappeared after a few moments of reminding myself that only i am in control of my actions and if i am afraid communication will likely not happen. i have had very mind altering/ spiritual experiences since living in washington state from 2012 until present. this among other experiences have transformed the way i view the world, the universe and consciousness as a whole. i am learning to face my fears and joining this site/ sharing my story is helping me do that. i believe there is no reason to be afraid of something that has demonstrated no harm, irrational fears are all inventions of your mind. taking back control of my mind and freeing myself has allowed me to channel higher intellectual entities and i am on a path to share those experiences with the world. we are in need of unity, not division. we need to overcome or re-program the binary thought process most of our society uses to make decisions. this is not a matter of whether \"aliens\" or ufos exist... this is a much much larger picture than that, take 1,000 steps back and ask not only why are they here, but what can we learn, what do we need to learn, what are we/ have we been doing wrong, what has offset the universe, how do we restore balance, how do we create unity, community consciousness to global consciousness to universal consciousness. it all starts with you.

started looking for it till i saw it flying south east  towards these star shape objects in the distance i started  flashing my flash light in that direction as much as i could till i could not see them any more from the track .So by then i walked around to find my girlfriend so we can go so i started walking home when we got on the side walk right by sunnyside high school i started with my flash light agian positing it in south sw so as i was doing that i notice a star that started blinking at first it was so high in the air i thought it was a plane but wheni flashed my light at it it flashed its light blinking it in the same order i was doing it . i did it 3 time then it did it 3 times so i started doing the light in differnt settings in excitement i told my girlfriend that was walking with me to look up and watch this so she saw the light  blinking and traveling at the same time it was a lil bit cloudy last night but clear enough to see the objects shape it looked like a star but an out line of a plate i could see the the shade of  camouflage it ws using to cover it self in darkness id say like the movie predator used with the alien all you cold see was the star light blinking away and it was going way faster and smoother then a jet no noise and slike as could be with all them air craft around and the base right there on valencia . 3 days in a row i have witness ufos in my back yard now the question is .Is it a hot spot or could it be the middle program in our back yard either way i believe in what. seen . also there wear 3 vans parked with 1 women in the

because it was so high in the sky. we had also considered it was a drone but it was too high in the sky. also the object now seemed too large to have ever even considered it a bird. it appeared muted gray with white lights on the back side which was now all we could see as it left in a direct or deliberate pattern as opposed to the random overhead gliding. the entire event last approximately 5-7 minutes.  there was a sense of incredulity and interest. however there was this sense of disbelief as though our eyes were playing tricks on us, and we just couldn't figure out what it was no matter

the west. at first we thought they  were chicken farms. then we saw them climb above the mountain ridge were they hovered. we kept observing them while climbing our aircraft to 28000 feet. they kept getting closer and climbing with us, eventually they stopped looking like bright lights, because as they got closer to us they became very clear flying discs.\r\nall white with no contrails or wing forms.\r\nthey were six and they sort of hovered and flew alongside, maybe 5 to ten miles to our left. the captain and i discussed what they might be and the flight attendants came in to look at them as well.\r\nthey didn't fly in straight formation like jet fighters do,, they climbed with us and floated next to us for about five to ten minutes.\r\nthen i got on the radio with air traffic control from monterrey, i asked them if they had military traffic in the area... and they said no,, and asked what i had seen.\r\ni said i saw six bright round objects, and inmmediately  silence on the radio came. then, in a split second, they dissappeared. \r\nthey  vanished without leaving any trails or contrails.\r\nwe kept looking for them and soon saw them again over the same mountain ridge, hovering

did not approach us...\r\nthis area were they were first seen is called the area of silence and is off limits by the mexican military. rumor is that there is a certain mineral that changes the

2015-07-20 at approximately 09:05 hrs my family and i were at glengarry park in ne edmonton, ab.  my children were playing on the kids equipment and i was speaking with my wife while keeping a watchful eye on them.  the weather was mainly sunny/clear with a few clouds and approximately 20 degrees celsius.  \r\n\r\ni happened to look up in the sky, which was very bright from the sun.  something caught my eye and i focused in on what i can only describe as an object which appeared very high in the sky.  i watched as the object appeared to be still, bright white, and not moving.  i could not make out a shape but it appeared very bright and circular.  i quickly pointed and told my wife to look up, which she did.  she was able to focus in on the object quite quickly.  a moment later, we both noticed the object was not alone.  at first we both observed 2 more objects which between the 3, formed a triangle.  then i observed a fourth object to the left of the triangle, and then another to the right.  the objects began moving to the ne at varying speeds.  at this time, i noticed one of the objects appeared to go from a bright white to a bluish color, and another from white to a hint of orange.  \r\n\r\nthroughout the event, most of the objects appeared to go in and out of focus.  at times we had to look away and then back in order to find them again.  one object though (the first one i saw) was always easy to spot.  in fact, this was the only object that decreased altitude and came significantly lower than the others (this happened about 5 minutes after first spotted).  \r\n\r\nmy wife and i estimated approximately 7-9 objects were seen during the event which lasted approximately 25 minutes.  during the event my wife and i attempted multiple short video recordings on our iphone devices.  at the time, we did not think the camera was picking up the objects as we could not see them on the screen.  the glare from the sun and reflection on the screen made it impossible to see anything.  we did our best guesses in pointing though and upon review found some clear footage of one of the objects and a faint view of at least two more.  she was also able to zoom in on the clearest object but found it would not focus.  \r\n\r\nat one point during the event, while observing the object and preparing my camera to take another recording, i noticed a passenger jet travelling in the direction of the clearest object.  i was able to get a recording of the object and jet in close proximity to each other.  it appeared the plane was lower in altitude but it's difficult to say for sure.  in review of the footage, i also noticed the clearest object's shape is hard to make out but it does appear to have one when zoomed in.  \r\n\r\nboth my wife and i have never seen anything like this before.  the objects would change directions in an instant and appeared to go from very fast (faster than the jet) to not moving at all.  we also noticed the objects were making various triangle formations as the moved.  as well, at no time did we observe a jet stream or anything emitting from the objects.  the park where the event occurred is approximately 10 km sw of

sky. their distance appeared to be at some point north of sycamore; perhaps within a mile of the more northern crossing of peace and rt. 23. and more in line with airport rd.\r\ni watched them to see if movement was apparent. the sky was relatively clear and not much for markers to judge with. when they didn't seem to be moving, i considered they might be helicopters checking high tension lines, but there are none in that area and they were too high to be doing that. i couldn't identify any structure indicating a tail or wings either man made or natural. at the distance i was at (approx. 3-4 miles away) they looked to be little more than circles or balls. they didn't reflect the sunlight  and there was no flickering to indicate movement or lights.\r\nother possibilities that i dismissed were kites (being so early i highly doubt it), paragliders (again unlikely due to time of day and also lack of movement), and hawks (no movement as if they were riding the thermals)\r\nthe first object was perhaps 1000 ft up at most. the second was about equidistant between the first and the ground and was more east from the first at an angle of 30-45 degrees.\r\ni watched as long as i could and even took a more rural road over to airport rd. to maintain eye contact, but the trees eventually obscured them as i got closer. by the time i reached rt. 64, and have a relatively unobstructed view, they were gone. i even went out of town and searched the skies with nothing but open fields and still found nothing.\r\n\r\ni'm not willing to call these ufos but definitely an unknown. i hope

managed to photograph last night in switzerland (21st july 2015 at around 11pm)\r\n\r\nlast night sitting in my lounge i noticed a strange orange light, i thought it was at first a plane as we can often see the flight path heading to geneva from our balcony.\r\ni saw a single point of light similar to the headlight on a commercial aeroplane, it was orange.  next to it, i saw an orange streak, it was actually the streak which appeared quite quickly that caught my eye.  the point of light was about the size i would expect for a commercial plane, but the streak next to it i found odd.  it was higher up in the sky, around where i would expect a flight path to be for a commercial plane.\r\n\r\nafter probably 30 seconds, the orange streak went away and the single point of light persisted probably another minute and then also faded out. i thought perhaps it was one of those chinese lanterns burning up.  i was also wondering if i had just witnessed a plane on fire.\r\n\r\nseveral minutes later, sitting back on the couch, i notice the light again this time larger and more of a streak than a point of light.\r\ni called my wife to have a look, we both remarked it was strange and she commented it may be a chinese lantern also.\r\ni went to get my camera at this point and snapped one photo before it faded out - probably only 30seconds to 1 minute from sighting to fading away had passed.\r\n\r\na few minutes later again, and the glow was back and much, much larger.  it was also much lower in the sky, appearing over the small hills we can see from our balcony out towards jura, and le vallee du joux.  it was quite large, and stayed for several minutes.  after a few minutes it also simply faded away to nothing.\r\n\r\ni managed to take some photos of this anomoly, one photo when it was a streak as described the 2nd time, lastly when it was quite low and persisted for some time we took quite a few photos.\r\n\r\nthe problem i have is that i was using a low light setting with no tripod, and you can see the house lights on the hill are streaked from the long exposure time as i have moved slightly.\r\nsome photos are much better than others, 2 photos in particular are reasonably clear, and i was hoping you may be able to comment on what this anomoly may be?\r\ni am completely baffled as to what the thing is, i thought this may interest you.\r\n\r\ni am using a canon eos 650d with a 55 to 250mm lense.  it was taken in the direction of vallee du joux / jura from lausanne.  to give you an idea of scale, you can clearly see the lights from the houses on the hill below (which are some what smeared from the long exposure in the photos)\r\n\r\ndue to file size i have sent you only the 4 photos which i believe are the best quality with the least smearing.  i do have more photos if they would help you in a determination, i am happy to provide them to you.  the last photo is a photo of the hill taken from roughly the same position, with the exact same photo and lense settings to give you an idea of scale and position - perhaps it is possible to overlay the daytime photo with the night photo to get a good idea of spatial positioning.\r\n\r\nyou can see that it is definately not a plane.  in this final phase when i was able to take several photos, the size of it was just much too large, too strange to be a plane, and much much too low to ground.\r\n\r\nin one of the photos, if you zoom you can see some textures on the object, but it is quite hard to tell if that is because of the movement of the photo.\r\n\r\nif you have any idea what this anomoly might be, please offer any explanation you may have.\r\n\r\nall rights reserved.\r\nalthough i agree to submitting these photos for analysis and discussion, i grant

blinded me for a second and i couldn't see, so i didn't see it disappear but it must have because it was gone. i felt very strange afterward, usually when i see something unusual it doesn't affect me

dark, about 25 minutes after sundown (my video timestamp can verify this).  i was especially enjoying the moon getting brighter through the trees since it was really starting to get darker.  through the trees i noticed at first one object. at first, i just thought it was an aircraft.  then i noticed it had an interesting color to it.  i would call it orangish-red.  it seemed to be fairly close.  then i saw two other objects similar to it behind it.  they didn't seem to be in any particular formation.\r\n     realizing that these objects weren't anything ordinary to me, and i think i've seen a fair number of conventional aircraft as well as tracked the  international space station on occasion, i decided i should take a video. i had my cell phone with me and with some fiddling around to get the video going, i recorded footage of about 2 minutes.  part of that footage is me walking over away from the trees to get a clearer view.  although i could see one object for many more seconds the video only seemed able to show one craft for a few seconds before being lost in the lower light conditions and the fact that the object was now much smaller heading northwest.  in retrospect, it seems the objects may have been traveling faster than i first would have thought.  \r\n     a radio controlled clock we have in the kitchen showed 9:12pm after i had been inside a few minutes.  the video
