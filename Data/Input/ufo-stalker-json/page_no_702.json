varying colors hovered, danced and disappeared on very clear nights. i was out stargazing a few times over the last few years because i'd heard there would be meteor showers or eclipses. these were definitely not meteors. at first i thought they might be drones or satellites of some sort but they were very fast moving (when they finally moved) and were fairly bright, and i don't think the military would put running lights on drones. it was strange, when i became aware of these lights, they moved not long after i noticed them, kinda zoomed away or disappeared. i felt a little creeped out but mostly mystified. couldn't for the life of me figure out what i'd seen. i'd assumed they must be ufos of a military or supernatural nature. they couldn't have been phosphorescent gas balls because most of the times i've seen them were in late fall to midwinter and phosphorescent gases are produced in hot swampy conditions in the summer.\r\n\r\nmy friend told me about this site and told me to report these sightings. last year was not the first time i'd seen them. i've mostly seen them in the n-ne sky near my home. appeared to be pretty high up and far away, anywhere from 75* to 90* from the horizon. possibly high in the atmosphere, maybe they were really big and just looked small. i wish i had had a camera with a telephoto lens. sorry for the lateness of the report. i just learned about this site and had to share. i'd like to know if anybody else in my area saw them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

live on a busy street with a lot of airplanes and helicopters over head all the time. i felt compelled, in my mind and heart, to look into the sky for some reason. as i looked up i immediately noticed an unknown object in the sky. as i observed it i realized i could not identify it, and felt that i should take a video and photos of it. i have observed and experienced unknown things for a long time over the period of my life. while recording the unknown object it was apparent that the quality of the image was not good, and i could not make out any more detail that i was able to observe with the naked eye. having recently recorded and reported another unknown sighting, i thought to snap a photo of the date and time on my phone as well. upon finishing taking photos i had a sense that i was meant to observe this unknown object and document it's presence. this is not the first time i have experienced a seemingly telepathic experience from an unknown object, but it is the first time i have documented and reported it. \r\n\r\ni observed that the object seemed to be ascending in the sky. i thought to myself that it could possibly be a bunch of balloons, but felt uncertain. what i was certain of was the emotions i had associated with being compelled to look into the sky, and to record the object as best i could. once i recorded the object, date and time i did not feel it was necessary to watch the object any more so i went inside my home. when i got upstairs i looked out of the window which faces the same area to see if the object was still seen ascending in the same direction. i could no longer see the object, which was strange since it should have remained viewable if it traveled at the same rate and direction once i went inside. the sighting ended then, and i no longer had any feelings associated with it, accept to make sure to report it. \r\n\r\ni am having a hard time with uploading the images and video for some reason. but i will happily email them to you upon request.

city, ia where i was living with a friend to have a vacation for a few days. we drove to his parents' farm in the council bluffs, ia/omaha, ne area. specifically, we were right next to the loess hills a few miles from a tiny town called thurman.\r\n     my friend's high school classmate joined us, and we built a large fire where the mowed lawn and trees met the hills and pastures. once the fire was blazing, we mixed drinks (our first and only; we were completely sober through this experience) and took our seats around the fire. we hadn't been sitting for more than 30 seconds when we all seemed to get the feeling that something was watching us and looked up at the top of the treeline. all i remember is a still, dark mass behind the blinding light that was projected at us. as soon as i had looked up, i turned away due to the intensity of the light. i remember looking down at my feet, then at the bonfire in front of them. i distinctly remember the fire disappearing, as the beam of light was far brighter than the fire itself. we were engulfed in the whitest light i have seen for a moment, and i'm not sure what happened next exactly.\r\n     it was like waking from a dream; we were all disoriented and looking around. i rememer yelling \"look!\" at the guys as i looked to the sky and caught a glimpse of a light zipping up into the atmosphere and disappearing from view. the light had a greenish glow to it; it reminded me of some of the xenon green headlamp bulbs i had seen in friends' souped-up import cars. we stood up immediately, shaken and stumbling around the yard trying to find an explanation for our confusion. we walked around the trees where it seemed that the light had originated for a few minutes before my friend's classmate decided he was too shaken and drove home. we walked around the yard a bit more wondering why the dogs hadn't made a sound if some foreign object had been nearby.\r\n     we went in the house and sat in the basement, confused and trying to calm down. when we noticed the time, we became quite alarmed. it seemed that 2 hours had gone by with a series of events that should have taken less than 15 minutes. \"impossible,\" we thought. we returned to our bonfire to find low-burning coals. the huge fire we had just built looked like it had, indeed, been going for 2 hours. an eerie, terrified feeling descended on us for the rest of the night. we hid in the basement, and my friend huddled in the corner crying.\r\n     we finally got some sleep, and in the morning were surprised that his parents were not at all shocked by this. they had seen ufo's years before our experience hovering in a nearby field, which was followed by the discovery of crop circles in another part of iowa. i feel fortunate to have had others present during this encounter, as it seems almost like a dream to me now. i have been able to check in with my old friend over the years to make sure that it did happen.\r\n\r\n     i have been curious about what actually happened to me since the event; today i found that craig r lang, a hypnotherapist and member of mufon, is near where i am now living in minneapolis, mn. i called to inquire about hypnotic regression, and he directed me here. i am certainly willing to cooperate to see what my experience can add to ufo research, and would like to be involved in mufon myself. i had always been open to the idea of life outside earth, but this event made me infinitely curious.","distance":"21-100

from the tree lines. it was disc shaped but more rounded on top and flat at the bottom. there were no exterior lights but there were windows around the craft that seemed to show a dark bright yellow coming from inside. the craft itself was a light green. iv never been able to pin point the exact green colour but close enough to explain. the craft was rising slowly into the sky making no noise. it seemed it was being rising by a chube of cloud that met the sides of the craft and up into the sky as far a my eyes could see. i could make out the lines of the cloud tunnel very clearly. the craft kept rising until it was gone. from the distance that i saw this craft i could have a good guess by saying it was easy 100meters in length and around 50 meters in height. for me it hasn't ended there. i have seen strange objects ever since but never get a chance to take videos or photos. people don't believe until they see but i will get evidence. i also believe i was abducted in my sleep a few

night sky i discovered a large object with a bright white light at each end moving silently through the sky. i am unsure of the actual shape of the object since it was dark outside, but the bright white circular light did appear at each end as if there were one light following directly behind the other at the exact same speed. i live near a busy fight path for 2 major airports nearby, boeing field and seatac international. i am very familiar with what aircraft look like at night on approach to either airport since they pass directly overhead, and this object was not a aircraft and it made no sound. i called for my wife to come look, and she too could not figure out what the object was. just a moment or so after observing the object, a commercial aircraft flew overhead on approach to land. it was moving wnw, had all strobes flashing and the landing lights were also on. it seemed to be on a direct crossing path with the object, and that they could possibly intersect each other. the commercial aircraft did seem to descend and its engines sounded as if they were being drastically decreased, a unusual sound for its relative position to the actual airport. a couple minutes later at 10:02 p.M. a smaller jet aircraft approached directly from the south and made a sharp wnw arching turn directly over my house and flew towards the general area where the object and commercial aircraft would have intersected paths at. i am an avid armchair ufo watcher and believer. i have witnessed multiple ufo's during my life, and this object was most definitely very, very odd.","distance":"Over

go to the bathroom. at this point in time we were homeless and living in a tent city that was just north of ontario international airport. as we all were walking around outside of our little encampment we all seemed to turn our attention to the skyline in the south west.I don't know how to explain it other than it sounded as if something in the sky that wasn't there suddenly in a fraction of a second was.Like it popped into the sky.The day was normal clear sky no wind.All i could hearvwas the sound of something cutting through the air at an unbelievable speed.Kind of a whooshing sound it seemed to come north towards us then change direction back towards the airport,then back again towards us. just off to the left hand side of us where a couple of dead trees that had no leaves on them.The branches on these trees began to whip back and forth at almost 90' degree angles. the sky above us seemed to be distorted and wavey and you could feel the presence of this huge object you could feel it in your body if that makes any sense. mind you our location at that time was in an area that commonly has high winds at times up to 70mph on rare occasions. we never saw these trees do what they were doing that day.There was no feeling of wind no dust being kicked up it wasn't until the event was over i recalled noticing the powerlines above the railroad tracks not 100 feet from the trees weren't swaying.I'm pretty sure the area we were in was \"restricted airspace\" as we could watch the jet takeoff and land at the airport.You could feel that there was something enormous in the air above us but could see nothing except like waves coming off hot asphalt.This all happened pretty fast the object shot over our heads towards the north west.I remember there was an old man named ken in the camp next to us sitting in his lawn chair he looked at us with a funny look on his face and said \"what the hell  was that\".Now i consider myself to be a sane fairly smart man i understand the possibility of atmospheric anomalies and other wierd things that might be possible.However this event was special i know there was something there,we all expieriaced this...Thing that happened i wish so bad i new it was going to happen so i could've made other observations but those trees never moved like that again that sound that feeling in my body never happened \r\nagain nothing should have been in the air that day certainly not going back and forth changing direction.We know what happened that day was something not everyone will ever experience.Thanks for reading this i told everyone that would listen keep up the hard work.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":68484,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0693543,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07222015-0026","longitude":-117.6437976,"occurred":1212339600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

mostly clear last night with only a few clouds. it came from the south along i35, it veered northeast over my house and did not appear to bank. it flew past my house, maybe a quarter mile, on it's north east course, when it stopped and hovered. hard to tell. it might have been closer.  the lights were very bright. i had my binoculars with me. nothing special just an old bosch 40 x 20. the structure between the lights was blurry. i live next to randolph air force base. it is common for planes and helicopters to fly over at night.The lighting on these crafts make the outline of the objects show up through the binoculars. not on this. what i could make out was a series of what might have been struts holding it together, but the detail was blurred.The lights on it were dazzling. blue white to ruby red. it was hard to look past the lights to focus on the object. i thought i might be looking at a drone. the lights were flashing and appeared to be changing position on the platform like they were moving or the thing they were connected to was twisting or warping. my eyes were being overwhelmed by the flashes and i got a sense of vertigo from watching. when i lowered my binoculars the lights went out. i thought it disappeared but then out of the corner of my eye i saw another one. looking just like the first. it flew to where i thought the other one was. it two was flashing the same kind of blue white light with the one intense red one. i watched it through my binoculars but it was as blurry as the first. it flashed it's red light several times. the light was so intense it seemed to light up the inside of my binoculars. i got that feeling of vertigo again, and put my binoculars down, to rub my eyes. it was still flashing when i looked back, but then it started moving north east again. the first one i saw was back where i first saw it disappear with it's flashing lights on. it then started to follow the second one still heading to northeast, in the direction of seguin texas. they moved slowly, (like they were looking or scouting for something) beyond my field of vision, their lights blinking a dimmer version of the white blue light and they started strobing or pulsing pretty fast before completely fading out. i don't know if they turned them off or if they just disappeared, before living my field of view. i checked my watch it was 1118 pm. i saw them for a total of 8 minutes. but it only felt like 2 minutes for the whole thing to happen. that was kind of strange. after they were gone  every time i would close my eyes i would see that red light like it seared my retina, like when one glances at the sun or a welding arch. when i closed my eyes to go to sleep i could still see it. but this morning everything is fine.Only i'm kicking myself for not having my phone or camera on me. i wanted to run inside and grab them, but i could not take my eyes off of what i was seeing, and i did not want to loose them or miss anything. that's my story. the only other thing i want to add is as i was watching the second one, for a moment i had i feeling it was watching me, watching it.

the ride was broken into 2 segments with a break for chili and drinks in the middle. i was 16 at the time and did not like the taste of beer, tho my best friend loved it, so when the group was done eating but several wanted to have a couple of beers before going back out, a younger girl and i decided to ride the first part of the trail ahead of the group and wait for the others at the top of the ridge since neither of us wanted to drink. we sat on our horses looking out over the valley and chatting when we noticed a light with blinking lights to our ne moving slowly from se to nw. at first we were not concerned as there was a guard post that often flew helicopters in the region and we assumed that was what it was. it would travel a short distance, 100 yards or so, descend, be at ground level for about 20 seconds, rise back up to about 100', then repeat the process. our horses were also watching the light closely, which was why we paid attention to it...Heads up, ears & eyes locked on it, snorting a bit. it took several minutes before we noticed that it did not sound like a normal helicopter, there was only a loud hum not the chopping sound one would normally associate with a helicopter. at that point we began to not only watch it closely but comment on it and ask each other questions about it, like \"what the heck is that\" and \"what do you think it's doing\". i finally noticed that it seemed to be following the exact path of the high tension wires that cross the valley, just a few seconds before it went down again almost due north of our position. about 5 seconds after that descent the lights all across the valley went out, quite noticeable as the local saw mill worked 24/7 and always lit up the horizon so when their lights went out it was immediately obvious. the object rose up one more time, and now the horses were both trembling and very tense, snorting loudly and shifting about. the lights began to blink more rapidly, and the hum became almost a whine and rose in pitch an instant before the thing shot straight up and out of sight, gone in a matter of moments. that was it for the horses, they both bolted for home and we had our hands full just staying with them for the panicked gallop back to the barn. we told the others what we had seen to open scoffs and ridicule, so we did not talk about it except to each other the rest of that evening. perhaps 10 minutes after the object vanished and we had started back out for the last half of the ride, 4 helicopters flew over the area, criss-crossing the entire valley, flying for the better part of an hour. \r\nmy best friend and i had planned on camping at the stable since it would be 2am or later when the ride would be over and the horses all put up, and the next morning she listened to the events of the night before with less scepticism, and agreed to ride to the top of the high pasture where the power line towers crossed the property of the stable. when we reached the one closest to the fence line, the base of which was about 20' on the other side of the fence in a wheat field, we could clearly see from horseback that the wheat was flattened down in a circle, swirled in a perfect spiral just like what we would later hear about as crop circles, with three deep square indentations in a perfect triangle just inside the outer edge of the circle. at that point my friend became quite frightened and to this day has refused to discuss anything that she saw.\r\nbeing 16 at the time and having been ridiculed on the night of the event, it was many years before i was willing to discuss this with anyone. i realize now that had i spoken up there might have been physical evidence retrieved from the site.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1
