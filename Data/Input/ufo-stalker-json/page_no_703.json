looked out of place. i noticed all the other clouds were moving as they should across the sky but one in particular had a rectangular figure to it (the cloud) . i looked closer and noticed that there was a dark disk that embodied it. i myself am very interested in the thought of extra terrestrial life and have followed and watched hangar 1 and ancient aliens. have said that, i looked closer at the unusual pattern in the sky and saw what looked like a small vortex or more descriptive (little tornado)  that lead from the larger black disk to a smaller white disk. this all keep in mind was at sunrise so to the average onlooker they looked like clouds. at this point i needed a second point of view. so i ran down stairs and grabbed my 17 year old brother and had him look. at first he said those are just clouds. then i told him look closer. right away he was astonished at what i was trying to show him. together we watched the rectangular \"cloud\" with a dark disk inside feed what looked like smaller disk shaped white or silver ufos absorb a dark substance out of the larger disk shaped craft. i grabbed my phone, told him to do the same and took some pictures of what we saw. i have pictures of the dark disk shaped craft that i hope i can share with you. however the smaller ufos cannot be seen on the iphone photos i took. to make things weirder which made my brother a believer, because he did not believe what i was showing him in the sky, was the sudden and abrupt lift into the sky from one of the smaller disks which caused a glimmer or a blink as it took off into outer space. we looked at each other and i said i told you! now he's in the other room talking to his friends online (computer games) convincing them of what we saw. nevertheless i stood there watching this happen for a time span of about 20 to 35 minutes. the craziest part of everything, watching this all happen near the end was seeing 5-10 small white disks appear out of nowhere; almost as if in the avengers, the helicarrier cloaking device, come and cloak the large dark disk out of the air. this is as descriptive as i can be. not only me but my little brother both saw this crazy event happen. i hope this helps and furthers your investigation.  i cropped one of the photos. the others you have to zoom in.","distance":"Over One

looking out the window.  i was wide awake, so i was listening to a radio show.  the first sighting was what i thought to be a shooting star coming down through the cloud covered night sky.  it was very  bright and startled me at first but then figured it to be a shooting star.  i also thought how close it must have came down because of the low clouds that night.  about a minute later the same bright streak came back from the ground back up into the sky, and took about the same route.  i could see there was a small orb like bright light at the beginning of it.  at this time i am nervous and wonder what in the world was that?  then about another minute later it came back down out of the sky and streaked like a pinball in about 6 different directions in a very high rate of speed.  the hair all over my body stood up on end and i felt like i was being watched.  after the object did its 6 streaks and pinball like action it shot back into the clouds.  i sat up and took a deep breath, also took a drink of water for a couple minutes.  i laid back down to try to sleep, all the while looking out the window but never seen anything else.  my cousin was with me sleeping on another cot, i didn't wake him because i didn't think he would believe me.  it happened so fast i don't know if he would have been able to see it anyway.  i told him the next morning and he acted like i suspected, not interested.  i asked a couple guys at the local restaurant if they heard of any sightings and they said that they had not.  this was the first legit sighting that i believe i saw as a real ufo. it

laughed at me, they slept in the same room with me but now i wonder why i never thought to wake them up during the episode.I did go to the spot where i estimated the\"fireball\" might hit if it had touched earth and found abare spot but being young i didn't know what to look for. now i shiver when i think about the face and eyes in the window. funny though at the time,i felt no fear at all.I am willing to submit myself to a lie detecting machine or whatever it takes to show that it really happened.I've not talked about this for45 years because i wasn't sure if it really happened or if i dreamed it and also ridicule, but i remember both \"staring sessions very clearly.Once again i will submit to anything to show this actually happened.Thank you for listening..Had to get it off my chest finally.Thanks again!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

star like object that seemed to have a glowing tail. at first i thought i believed it to be a star, but then i noticed it was wobbling and appeared to be falling. it was glowing from red to blue, at which point i ran inside to get my mother and my nephew to make sure they saw the same thing i did. they came outside and confirmed what i was looking at. the star like object was wobbling back and forth while changing colors. then it appeared to throw tiny sparks out of the northern end. we concentrated on this object for a while trying to figure out what it was. our perception led us to believe it was taking place in outer space because the physics are not possible due to earth’s gravity and atmosphere. we knew it was not a star or a plane, we did not know what it was. we were bewildered by what we were looking at and we started looking around the night sky at other stars. then we saw something truly remarkable. a large black object which had 3 bright lights shaped as a triangle with a red light in the middle, and it was hovering for a couple minutes directly north of us. we started to point at it, and were shocked and were not sure what we were looking at, then it started to move, and it flew directly over us. this object made little to no sound, which did not make sense considering how big the lights were, at that point we knew we were seeing something unexplainable. this object flew right over us, picking up speed until it moved behind a tree and then it was gone. the triangular object moved much faster than normal planes and helicopters. this object was almost silent and we are not sure the distance to the ground because the lights were huge and very bright. once it passed the trees we lost track of the object. we focused our attention back to the original star like object. the star like object was still hovering and changing colors while the triangular shaped object was gone. about 1 minute later we saw what seemed to be a helicopter that made a circle around the area we saw the triangular object. the helicopter was loud and had normal looking lights thus we believed it to be a helicopter. also a few planes flew in that direction afterwards, again, they were loud and contained normal lighting, and the speed of the helicopter and planes were normal. the triangular object moved faster than both the helicopter and planes. the triangular object also was silent compared to the helicopter and planes that came next, (almost like they were tracking this object) we believed the helicopters and planes were tracking this object because they flew in the same direction and made a circle around the star like object in the distance. we must have sat outside for 45 minutes at least trying to figure out what we saw. the star like object in the distance was still hovering/and blinking which looked like it was falling. but did not actually fall, we watched the star like object grow dim until it to was gone. at this point the night sky was silent again, we decided to go back inside our house, and none of us were sure what exactly we saw. the craziest thing was how big the lights were on the triangular craft like object, and the red light directly in the middle, we are still not sure what we saw. we cannot explain it.  we all agree we have never seen anything like this before.","distance":"101-500

playing with wife and toddler son in a basketball field near our house in north jakarta, indonesia. first noticed the object when pointing out the hunting bats and swallows to my son. it was on my south and moving towards the north west direction. first impression of the object was that it was somewhat spherical and moving at a constant speed and constant altitude. altitude was from the best of my judgement around the 300-500m high, and moving slowly and constantly throughout the event at about 50m/minute.\r\nas it drew nearer to my location, the shape looked more like a slightly vertically squashed sphere, akin to a red blood cell. it had a metallic sheen because it clearly reflected the orange glow of the setting sun. upon longer inspection, the shape seemed to constantly slightly distorting and bobbling because the reflected sunlight was not consistent, although the object largely hold its original shape. judging from the distance and altitude, my best guess is the object is at least 5m in diameter.\r\nafter about a minute after noticing the object, i used my iphone 5s to video the object as best as i can (attached to report), although limited phone memory cut short the duration of the video. after finished recording, the object started to slowly make a very wide arc to the left, without changing speed or altitude, and changed direction southwesterly, which means moving away from my location. i then started to walk/jog and chased the object for about 1-2 minutes over 150 meters, then ceased because i didnt want to leave my wife and son behind in the basketball field. the object then slowly moved away and disappeared over the treeline after a couple more minutes.\r\nwhat drew me to the object in the first place was that i never saw anything like it before. during the sighting and afterwards, considering the things i saw my impression largely is that the object is probably man-made, maybe a stray weather balloon that drifted with the wind. the few things bugging me is the shape of the object which is like a red blood cell, the definite metallic sheen of the surface, and the changing of the direction of the object, albeit slowly. video is also not very supportive because of the maximum zoom, large distance to the object and me constantly moving around.\r\nwould really like to have somebody from mufon to contact via phone or email to exchange ideas on this.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This encounter happened when i was very young in the 1990s somewhere between 1992-1994, i don't quite remember exactly, but i was between 6-8 years old then when my ufo encounter happened, this may get lengthy but i am providing as many details as i can\r\n\r\nthe reason i am finally posting this is because i'd possibly like help locating the video evidence that i know exists from this night that was on the local news channels (wgrz and wivb 2 & 4 in my area) (yes i know there is a big gap in years to narrow it down, sorry)\r\n\r\nhere's what i remember from the night, it was a typical summer friday evening in western new york(wny) and my dad, my mom, my dalmatian and i were getting ready to head to our weekend home out in fillmore ny. we left on time approx 7-8 pm after dinner and if you look at one of the images i posted you can see our route that we took, we get to the 400 highway (which i circled on one of the images) on our trip to camp just fine, once we got on the 400 highway though we began seeing very odd red and green flashes in the distance pretty much at the horizon since we couldn't make out what was causing it, we didn't think too much of it except perhaps maybe it was some weird heat lightning as this was a muggy hot summer evening.\r\n\r\nfast forward a bit, we are still seeing the flashes around arcade but still can't figure out what is causing it, but we keep going, same through centerville going up and down the big hills of centerville road. we finally reach fillmore on time a little over a hour after leaving buffalo, the image that corresponds to the next part has the blue lines and red circle on it, the roads that we took are west main street/rt 4 to ballard road, make a right onto ballard road and then a left onto schunknecht road, normally we continue on to dutch hill annex but the encounter happened at the top of the hill around the bend (can see on the route image and the google earth image of the tree line),\r\n\r\nnow when we got to schunknecht road it's dark out...So we're driving up this back country road at night, we turn the bend and as we reach the top of the hill (in the image you see a house right at the tree line, this house did not exist when this happened), there is this giant glowing green cigar shaped object that was longer than the road is wide by about 20 feet on each side of the road, it's hovering above the tree line absolutely silently (we had the car windows open), my mom is absolutely panicking at the sight of this, i'm on the floor of the backseat crying, my dog is right there with me on the floor with it's hair standing straight up, my dad being in the military and working with nike missiles in the 50s wasn't afraid (he's told me stories of objects on radar flying at thousands of mph that just disappeared) of the object that is only about 200-300 feet away from us,my mom wants to go home at this point, but my dad backs the car up maybe another 20-30 feet and turns the high beams of the car on and points them directly at the object, as soon as this happens the glowing lights of the object immediately turned off and you could see the silhouette of the cigar shaped object against the moon/starlit sky and it starts floating over the tree line in complete silence and disappears.\r\n\r\nwe continued on with our trip and get to our place and go right over to my grandma and aunts mobile home (5 mobile homes sharing 35 acres of land) and tell them all about it while we are all shaking scared, now the reason i posted that hopefully someone else encountered this same event is because in the one image i circled the town of scio ny, we watched the 11pm news that night and sure enough there was a story about the object because it was seen not only by us in fillmore ny but by multiple people throughout arcade ny, fillmore, botsford hollow, short track,scio as the object went from town to town to town over the course of 2-3 hours and someone from scio recorded the object sitting over the tree line where we encountered the object up close and it was on the news broadcast and i really would like to see any footage of the object again if anyone can find anything about it.\r\n\r\nnote: i've had other encounters with other strange objects out in the same area in the years following this, but in 2004 we sold the property to stay in the city. i wish either of my parents were still alive so i could add their personal perspectives of what happened this night as well.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path

should go get my phone or camera cause my eyes didn't believe what i was seeing. not 5 seconds later, \"it\" shot up to exactly where it came from, hovered for a few seconds  then flew at a right

move. after being returned fully to my bed to took several minutes before i could move.  i was looking up at the craft and as the beam of light was returning to the craft the celling of my room began to materialize back into form.  i looked at the clock and it was approx. 3:30am.  the last thing i remember was just going to the bathroom and changing the channel on the tv around 11:45pm.  after several weeks i started to remember my experience in the craft.  i remember being in a very bright room on a table and surrounded 6-10 small beings what you would call greys. they were telling me to not struggle and they meant no harm. this i believe was to pacify me so i wouldn't struggle and would be an easier test subject.  i remember sever pain in my abdominal region and right hip.  i also saw a large insect like creature that seemed to be telling the greys what to do.  i don't have any memory until i was being returned to my bed by a beam of light.   i don't know if i have any marks on

on top of the hill i live on.  (the maple leaf neighborhood.)  i was getting vids of the sunset and then started counting the stars as they became visible.  after about fifteen stars had become visible i gave that up, and was about to leave, but then i saw something that made me grab my camera again.\r\n\r\n  it was a bright orange light that appeared in the north.  it was traveling south, towards me.  although the color dose not show up on my vid, tha fact that it shows up at all indicates that it had to be very bright!  because i had just heard about our government having silent helicopters, i chose to video it and see if it remained silent.  it sure did.  but i lost sight of it when it was directly overhead.  then about five minutes later it happened again!  this time i got my vid going quicker, but again i lost sight of it when it was directly overhead.  i can't say what it did because i was looking at my screen and i at first thought that i'd just moved the  camera off it by accident.  i was blessed with a third chance though!  about five minutes after the second orange light, a third one appeared.  it also came from the north and was heading south directly for me.  this time i was determined to keep my eyes on the thing!  i managed to keep it in the screen also.  again, very bright orange, like a pumpkin.  moving a little faster than a normal satalight, but slower then a plane.  maybe about the same as a military jet might move if it was up really high.  it came directly over me and started to shift it's course. it began curving off towards the east.  then after about two second of that it suddenly began moving directly south again.  i followed it with my eyes and my camera until it faded from view in the south.\r\n\r\n  the video is pretty dull i think, except for my talking.\r\n\r\n  i know this is pretty normal stuff for you folks, but i just thought i'd get the news out anyway.\r\n\r\n  feel free to call me if you want to talk.\r\n\r\n  also, years ago, i saw what looked like a fighter jet just huvering above the freeway.  as i drove under it, waving my arms around to say to all the other moterists \"hey look\", it actually tilted it's right side down towards me.  it seemed like the place where an occupant would sit was intentionally keeping me in sight.  i tried to report this, but i didn't know who to report it to.\r\n\r\n  again, thank you so much for your work!\r\n\r\n  it's good to have a place to share this, so there can be a public record of it.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

people starting to point and say things like what is that what is that! thats not a plane people were saying as it got closer and closer it was coming towards us in a line ,more than one,it appeared there were a few.I did not know what it was i asked my dad who was a police officer and he told me and my friend to hide .So we went under a chair on the front lawn but could still see the lights and hear the rumble and feel as thought it suddenly got stormy out.It was the scariest ive ever felt in my life and i still remember that fear today and i am almost 50.There were alot of other people there that night and i always wonderd if anyone else ever reported anything  from that night.I remember asking people about it later on and they would remember something strange  but would never come out and say what.I know it had to be a ufo because of the fear and reactions of the adults that were there that night.It scared me good.After it past it was hard to go on with the night as it was normal things just seemed different.Always wonderd if someone else talked about it.Like i said it was the late 70's  and i was a kid but i know what i saw and i know what i felt.Ofcourse the adults were all laughing afterwards saying we seen a ufo but no one was laughing when it was overhead and going by us.Anyway thats my sighting hope someone out there reports it to.It took me a long time but

looked up straight at the stars they did not twinkle. only through periferal vision could i notice the twinkling stars. the area of twinkling stars was large but only directly overhead. i then noticed dark blue lights moving from east to west. they moved slowly across the sky silently.\r\ni thought maybe heat was distorting the night sky as it does sometimes but only the stars overhead were twinkling not throughout night sky. after event no stars twinkled at all. i have never in my life seen anything like this. my guess based on research is this large ship had light bending capability and that is what made the stars twinkle. curvature of the ship created this look as it could have been refraction the light from the stars above it. this could also be why when i looked directly up at the stars they did not twinkle but only with periferal vision did my eyes notice this. the lights were about 100 ft up (+or-) and from that distance they were about the size of led christmas lights in a dark royal blue color. there are lightning bugs in this area but they are a green to white color and usually fly around plants and trees sporadically. this was completely different and flew in a straight line in the night sky exactly from west to east over central michigan 1/4 mile from hwy 127. i have not seen light bending technology before but as i stated from all my research this is exactly what this was. as to why this object had the dark blue lights fading from bright to dim, yet never blinking, i do not know. no one believes me but i know what i saw! needless to say i completely forgot to smoke my cigarette. i hope this occurrence has been viewed by others either during this time or in the past in order to help track this specific type of

have just finished work, and was out side in my back garden having a smoke before i went to bed. it's was about 01:15 am. it was a beautiful clear night and the stars was out and could clearly see the dipper consolation. as i was looking at the stars, i noticed a bright flash to my left, it was more like a slow flash,if that makes any sense. the object was travelling from south to north. it was a brilliant pure white light and then faded out after a few seconds it happened again, each time it faded in and out the light never got dimmer or brighter, it was just the brilliant white light. each pulse lasted for about a second, then about 3 seconds later it was back on. i know it was not a playing as i live under one of the flight paths of bristol airport and i'm used to the flight patterns in this area. i also work on the beach as a warden and i do search and rescue as well and i very aware of what flares and helicopters look like day and night. as the object went pretty much overhead going towards the big dipper and out of site i then noticed much higher in the sky what appeared to be a satellite moving across the sky, so i grabbed my laser pen and confidently put the laser on it, as i new it wasn't a plan or a helicopter. to my amazement it stopped dead in its tracks i flashed the laser again and it started to move. i turned to go in the back door into the kitchen to grab my phone so i could film what was going on, i came back out and it was gone. i have spent all day going over what i had seen knowing it wasn't a chinese lantern, aeroplane, flare or helicopter, and definitely not swamp gas. \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line
