parking lot in tucson on 7/4/15 and we set up night vision cameras for a ufo night watch since we're enthusiasts.  at approx. 8:45 pm we saw over the catalina mtns. to the ne a bright medium sized star which would be impossible due to multi layers of heavy clouds.  also airplanes never have their headlights on over areas of wilderness as far out as this light was.\r\n\r\ni immediately turned my camera on (i have a luna optics color night vision camera).  i have the camera running to a 7\" monitor and both are tripod mounted.  the light was seen in the monitor as 2 lights close together on the horizontal and to the right of these lights (from my perspective) there were huge flashes of bright blue light.  as the lights sat stationary for a couple of minutes a 3rd light began to be seen between the two.\r\n\r\ni'll let the video speak for all the events that happened after that since they are too numerous to detail.  the main things to notice are at the very beginning my camera swings to the right just enough to pick up the radio towers on the top of the catalinas that are about 8 to 10 miles from where my camera was set up.  they are out of focus yet the lights in the sky are in focus.  i have the focus set for clarity of stars and satellites.  jets that are 20 to 40 miles away are in focus in the night sky as well.  thus we estimate that this object (or more likely 3 independent objects) is probably 30 to 40 miles away and can't be too far due to it being under the heavy cloud cover.\r\n\r\nalso to notice are changes in overall lighting in the video most of which are due to car taillights as they exited the park.  about 4 minutes of the video had to be edited out due to car headlight interference washing the video out.  however, about half way through the video (at the 4:10 mark) there are seen staccato bursts of light and then the big green light appears in the sky to the left of the primary lights.  these staccato bursts are not from cars, from us or anyone else since we were isolated in the far southwest corner of a large parking lot.  i believe these lights were generated by the ufo itself since there is no other logical source. \r\n\r\nalso to note if you look very carefully at the 5:08 mark a very faint, white ghosted image appears to the left of the mountain top and this moves across towards the original display of lights and then at 5:25 a second row of 3 lights materializes to the left of the original.  \r\n\r\nwhen the primary row of lights seems to change shape and become a blurred mass of one object, that is only because i am trying to get a better focus.  the last couple of minutes of the video shows how stable these 3 primary lights actually were with no drastic changes in their shape or position in the sky.  the video ended because my camera ran out of memory.  in reality the lights stayed on in an unchanged way for another couple of minutes and then suddenly blinked out without having moved.  \r\n\r\nmy video is 8 minutes long but with the lost footage of about 4 minutes and with the ending lost the actual duration of the incident was likely 14 to 15 minutes long.  the lights again showed up 27 minutes later but this time one stationary light gradually became a horizontal row of 5 white lights with more flashing and other lights appearing and disappearing in the vicinity.  \r\n\r\nmy friend has a very poor pulsar night vision camera and he caught both events on video and although very poor some of the variables that i mentioned can still be discerned.  his night vision captures can be seen on youtube on his channel.  the second incident that happened 27 minutes later lasted approx. 9 minutes and again ended with the primary light(s) from a stationary position throughout just blinking out.\r\n\r\nhopefully the video file i sent is watchable but if not it can be found on my youtube channel under my exact name that i've provided.","distance":"Over One

facing porch smoking a cigarette and watching the sky. i have never before this night seen what people term a ufo, and only recently became convinced of their existence. as a normal routine when i am home smoking, it is on my back porch, as i do not smoke indoors.\r\n\r\ni was following the northward flight path of what appeared to be a commercial jet liner. it did not have flashing lights, but rather a single steady white light.  i tend to watch these types of movements, disregarding aircraft with flashing lights. as i watched it for around 30 seconds, it was now, i estimate in the airspace close to or directly over portland international airport.  at which time an object, from my perspective, crossed its path moving from the north west.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a meteor, as it gave off a reddish glow that was getting slightly brighter. there was no fire trail, and instead of seeing it burn-up, the glow began dimming. before the glow disappeared it brightened again to the same intensity i had first seen. the red pulsating object was not very bright, in fact, had it not passed over the path of the jet i was initially watching, i might not have seen it at all.\r\n\r\nthe red glowing object pulsated from dimmest to brightest, and back to dimmest in about 1.5 seconds. this timing continued and was constant for the 10 to 12 seconds i witnessed the object.  it appeared to be traveling in a straight line heading south and slightly east. in, i would approximate the direction of california.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the object, it was on my right side, to the west, somewhere over the portland international airport, a few miles west of my location.  after about 3 seconds it was directly south of me.  i was excited at this point, and was intensely watching.  another 3 seconds, and it was to the left of me, on my east side. from my perspective, the distance in the sky where i first witnessed this object to when it was directly to my south, was approximately how far it had traveled to the left, or the east of me.  \r\n\r\nat this time, it now appeared to be moving directly away from me. this may indicate a course change to a more southerly heading. at this point the red pulsating glow of the object appeared to fade over the next 4 seconds, as it moved away from me at an extremely high rate of speed, and was then lost to light pollution on the horizon.\r\n\r\ntotal time of sighting was about 10 seconds. the object was moving at such a high velocity as to make the jet i had been watching at the start: appear to be moving like a snail. furthermore, i would not be surprised if the ufo crossed oregon(from northern border to southern border), and reached california in 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

soon as i walked out from under the carport i heard a low, but still loud roar or rumble maybe of a plane-like object and when i looked up i saw an extremely large, long/narrow triangular shaped craft about to go directly over us. i yelled for my husband to look up and asked him what it was we were looking at and he just stood there speechless with me as we watched it fly very slowly over us. it was lower than any plane flies over out here, but not just that close (not just abover the trees or anything). from my view, i saw one red blinking light in sort of a square shape right in the center and 2 white lights closer to the end corners that never blinked. i could vaguely make out detailed compartments or pieces of the underside as it was right above my head and it slowly made its way across the sky past my view due to trees. my husband had enough tome to run and grab his rifle with a scope and look thru it and see the object up closer than i did, and said at the front (cockpit i suppose?) was 3 windows or something that were lit up from the inside, and describes the rest just as i did. we were astounded, never seeing anything like this before, and cannot figure out what it
