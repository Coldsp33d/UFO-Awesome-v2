6:30 am in mid october 1992. i was fully awake and was not sleepy or tired. \r\ni walked with a colleague across the front of the loading bays ( for chilled food distribution) , as we reached the far side (7 loading bays widthways away) , we both turned to walk down the side of the building to go to the canteen for a coffee before work.\r\n\r\nsomething compelled me to look to the left, i saw an elongated cigar shaped object hovering above the 2 storey office building , the object appeared to hum and i could feel vibrations from it in the air. the object in more detail was around 50 to 80 feet away and appeared to be around 2- 300 feet in length and around 2 storeys high maybe more. there appeared to me a mist on the top of the object and i can remember making out that the top was not flat and had what looked like aeriels on top of the whole length but very short and uniform . the colour of the object was dark grey like unpolished steel , although the objects on the top were a kind of gold yellow colour.There seemed to be movement in a couple of the windows but nothing i could make out in detail.\r\ni do not remember any lights on the object at all , along half of the length of the object appeared to be round and some rectangular windows like portholes , these were of a darker colour than the main body. the bottom of the object was slightly curved at the ends and almost horizontal along the length\r\n\r\nmy colleague stood staring with me for about 2 -3 minutes , he said \"they're here\" . i then got cold shivers and we both ran down the side of the building at full speed to the canteen. we both asked each other did that really just happen? we decided not to speak about it again for fear of ridicule.\r\n\r\ni cannot explain this object but i can confirm this was not a weather balloon , nor was it any aircraft i was aware of at the time or now.\r\ni'm not aware of anyone else seeing this either. \r\n\r\nshould you wish to clarify any info i have given i am happy to do so.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Patterned

attorney, and myself, a retired rn and now music business executive, were driving to his home in a rural area of the largest rural county in tennessee. he noticed the lights in se sky and commented on them as being unusual~ something he hadn't seen before. i too, hadn't seen anything like them. as we drove down the dark country road to his small farm, the object seem to be slowly moving across the sky and rather than park the car when arriving home, we drove to the back field of the property which is flat and unobstructed by trees and other topography. we get out and sit on the hood of his car and watch over the course of an hour as the craft accompanied by an identical one track across the clear spring sky. we decided the second craft was behind the first upon initial siting. he asked me if i could hear anything. i listened and noted outloud that the crafts, based on size and relatively low altitude should be projecting engine sounds. he agreed and this is the first thing that seemed objectively odd. secondly, the speed of movement, again , based on altitude and size of the crafts seemed to defy what he and i know of physics. the track across our line of sight of approx. 25 miles seemed too slow..Which suggests they were beating the laws of gravity. the arrangement of the triangular lights and what appeared to be a shadow of a structure of craft of more square or rectangular shape , dark in color was another oddity to us as we both know something of the necessity of spherical shape to make an object's aerodynamics compatible with flying. i was a part time high school advanced math substitute teacher and know enough to know, i can't explain the aerodynamics of these craft and neither can my friend who jumped from planes during first gulf war. before they reached the horizon to the ne (towards nashville, tn), they vanished. no descent to land. no machiv verticle ascent to the stars. simply vanished. higher in the night sky, during this event we noted the path of 2 commercial aircraft at altitudes well over 25-30k ft, and even they ,upon passing directly overhead, could be heard on that night. there is an af base in the general direction from whence they came, but operations are rare and involve large cargo carriers. the nashville bna airport is ne but the crafts vanished well before a probable descent there. in fact , since weve observed that no commercial craft can be seen making its descent, day or night from this location as we are simply too far away and we've noted that there is an altitude difference roughly half way between this location and nashville bna airport where we are just above sea level and the airport is slightly more than us.  we were not scared or did we fear for our safety. the craft did nothing to suggest we were of note to them. we are neither skeptics or believers of ufo's though since we've discussed the possibility the military may have developed crafts that can only be tested at night. but, the lack of noise? ive asked around...This is an oddity noone can explain. the ability to be have such mass and yet move that slowly at an altitude no higher than a helicopter? odd. \r\n","distance":"Over One

ago, i walked out onto my back deck and saw two perfect circles side by side and perfect in diameter. approx. 30 feet in diameter. i noticed that inside of these circles that all grass, veg. was burned and killed. i noticed no other disturbance other than inside of these circles themselves. i showed my husband and two children. they all had no reason at all as to why these circles would be in the lower bottom of our yard, and i was told by them to \"just forget about it\". i watched the circles over the last three years and have found that very little grass has tried to regrow, but the circles are still very pronounced! still almost as perfect in diameter as they were at the time they first appeared. i have been trying to just \"forget about it\" and go on with my life but a voice inside me is telling me to report this, yet something else seems to have had me put it off as well. but there are other more important things that occured during the time that i first noticed the appearance of these circles. not sure if the following was prior to, during, or after my noticing these circles. i was having very lucid dreams. or shall i say nightmares or night terrors. i will describe two of these \"night terrors\" or \"dreams\". 1.) i was advancing through a wormhole in space. my leg was hurting while i was having this \"dream\", and i awoke with my leg still in pain. 2.) in another \"dream\" during the time of noticing the circles in the back yard, i was \"swept\" up in an unusual but smaller \"pod\" (not from this world). i entered the pod alone, but felt the spirit of my youngest son with me. there were two long benches that curved the inside of this \"pod\" and as the pod \"swept\" up away from the ground, i looked down and saw the earth being destroyed. next, i was in \"space\", and i saw very bright light everywhere, very very bright light. at this same time, a man appeared sitting across from me in this \"pod\". he was dressed in a white gown, and was a male with long dark blonde curly hair. he did not say a word, but i was being taken to another planet where i saw what looked like a small city..Monorail like transportation. i assumed this is where i would be living. i had other \"dreams\" or \"visions\" of world ending events, and dying and feeling \"at peace\". i would very often awake from these \"dreams\" screaming, crying, dis-oriented, and did not recognize my own surroundings. i was also struggling with high anxiety and depression. i was scared to go to sleep. these \"night terrors\" would debilitate me! also for some bizarre reason, i am terrified to enter my bathroom at night, which if you look out of the blinds you can see the strange circles that were left. since all of this has occurred, i and two members of my family have been struck with diseases similiar to lyme. i was diagnosed with rocky mt. spotted fever. two years ago, but i also have symptoms of lyme disease. my son was diagnosed with lyme disease and my husband, although not diagnosed is having more severe symptoms. he spends most of the time outdoors, doing the lawnwork, etc. i would love for you guys to come and take some soil samples, and try to get to the bottom of this very odd occurrence, as i would like to have some answers as well, as to why or how these circles appeared, and if my night terrors, or what seems to be \"ptsd\", is at all related to this. your help is greatly appreciated! i have put this issue off long enough now. it's time to get answers! i do not have internet at my home, as it is in a very rural location. so please contact me

we passed by dayton road, i saw a red light just above the tree line. it was an unusual red color and i pointed it out to my girlfriend. i was not sure what i was looking at. as we drive down the highway our path brought us pass it. i lost sight of it but my girlfriend could still see it. she then claimed it turned colors from red to purple then back to red. we lost sight of it the further we drove. i was confused as to what i could be seeing. it was too low in my mind to be an air craft and the light was not blinking or flashing to indicate it might be a plane. and the red color was a reddish orange. and when my girlfriend claimed the light turned purple it was very curious. we decided to turn around and investigate the light. \r\n\r\nwe traveled back in search of the light but could not find it where we had last seen it. so i decided to take a road that would have brought us closer to where i thought it might have been. we turned down staddens bridge road and as we did i spotted the light again. this time it appeared to be over the licking river. we pulled onto the bridge and stopped to watch the object. it was a bright red and moving at a slow pace. it seemed to be moving up the wood line on the south side of the river towards us. it then turned north and began to slowly cross the river. the light was bright red and yellow. the reflection of the sphere could be seen on the river as it passed. it was then i pulled out my phone and tried to photograph it. we watched it until the object crossed the river and we started to lose sight of it behind the tree line. i quickly drove down the road to a clearing where i knew there would be no trees to obstruct our view. it was maybe 60 seconds later when we arrived at the clearing and we spotted the object again, this time though it was just a red dot of light quickly traving north away from us. we watched it for approximately 5 more seconds before it was out of sight completely. \r\n\r\nwe continued on our way home and i tried to think of what it could have been that we saw. i ruled out modern craft due to how slowly it moved in the beginning and how low it was. there was also no sound coming from it. there was a storm that passed through a while before and there was lighting in the sky and thought it might be some kind of plasma orb. i don't know much about that phenomenon but thought the sighting lasted too long for it to be that. pluse it was a solid orb of light, there was no variation to its shape as it traveled. we discussed it further and we're just confused by the whole experience. the pictures i captured were terrible and does not show the red light the object was emitting.

the same direction as the orange orbs.\r\nthen, out of the corner of my eye, i spotted an object traveling silently and without lights of any kind, going from the west to the east at an elevation of 15 degrees, at an altitude of about 2000 feet, at a steady state speed that would be faster that a high flying airliner, which often pass over my location. the object made no obvious noise, it passed right by the orange orbs at around the same altitude, but going in the opposite direction. it was also headed towards the approaching airliner, which was flying at a cruising altitude for a normal airliner which was much higher than the object was.\r\n\r\nthe object was diamond/kite shaped, with the point of the long end pointing towards the ground, or slightly to it's rear opposite of it's flight path.\r\nthe exact shape was that of an elongated diamond, or of a very narrow but long diamond shaped kite. i viewed the object as if the flat side of a kite would be facing directly towards me. the color of the object was white with a hint of silver, and non reflective, but it was reflective enough to the point that it could be highlighted by the available starlight alone, so as to make the object, its exterior, and it's outline completely visible to me. i watched the object fly by for a total of around two minutes or so, until i lost sight of it as it flew behind some trees at the end of my street.\r\n\r\nthe object was very large, but easy to miss if a person was not looking in that specific direction and location at that specific time, because it was completely silent and completely unlighted. and it was definately diamond shaped, and it was not a weather or other balloon, or a group of balloons tied together, or a weather balloon.\r\n\r\nthe weather was completely clear, with many stars easily viewable, especially for my location in the suburbs near a major city. there was no moon, ans it was extremely dark for a summer night. there was an extremely light and very thin wispy slight cloud cover in the night sky, very sparse, and only in one or two distinct spots, located at the uppermost extreme heights that clouds can exist in the atmosphere. the wind was blowing out of the north nw at 7 mph or less, which would mean that the object would have been traveling crosswise to the wind direction, the temperature was 67 degrees, the humidity was 64 percent. this was after we had a rather extreme daytime temperature of 90 degrees and near 95 percent humidity.

signal.  it seemed strange to me as i have never seen this 'signal light' before and then all of a sudden i spotted the object in the sky over quebec across the river.  just seemed odd.  now they do river rescue and things i believe from that island but usually then you see a search boat maybe go out but nothing happened.  maybe they were just testing their equipment, i don't know.  just seemed odd.\r\n\r\ni couldn't really make out a shape of the orange/light grey/white object above but at first it looked starlike but because of all the dancing and sharp turns up and down and sideways it was hard to tell.  there also could have been more than one in the same area and my feeling is that there was but i couldn't see for sure because it all seemed to be so random in movement that it was hard to tell if it was one morphing or more than one playing around, couldn't tell.\r\n\r\nthere was no noise and i was out on my balcony but possibly closer in quebec there was, couldn't tell from this distance which is way over a mile i would think.\r\n\r\ni think that is about it.  hope someone else saw it and will report in.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One
