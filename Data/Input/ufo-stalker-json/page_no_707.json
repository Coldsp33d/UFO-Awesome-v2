walked outside onto a screened in porch. another short flashed directed my attention to the tree line by the house and an object just above the trees which then settled behind the trees above a large ravine. i just looked at it a moment, not knowing what to do. then i felt an energy around me; i could not see it but felt it. from a certain angle i could see a laser of some kind, not the whole time, it came on and went off a number of times as the energy began to  make my hairs stand on end. \r\n\r\nthen i began to have thoughts of her in my head. this is  hard to explain. it was not as though she was communicating with me telepathically, it was as though she was planting memories of conversations in my head, memories of conversations i had not had with her. she was human, i could just tell.\r\nshe warned me that time was running out, specifically because a \"true\" globalization was milestone of some kind, that was incompatible with our economic system. \r\n\r\nshe told be \"divine creature\" only meant social being, that social beings were meant to live in unified tribal society, without separated elite and the labor classes, that our tribal culture was split by a mistake long ago by a rebellion they wee responsible for, that they were sorry for all the  suffering they caused humanity, that they had fought a war to free us, so that we could choose to return to tribal society again, but we did not choose too return to tribalism. we were betrayed by people who decided to claim the kingship of the beings who had enslaved us. they cannot intervene again. we must start the next rebellion to free ourselves from the ruling elite before they can aid us. our tribal culture was split and it must become unified again before we can ascend a join the celestial tribes. \r\n\r\ni have wrote everything down i could remember but i a starting to forget, but i got the impression that what the christians might call armageddon is more like a global rebellion of labor, followed by an act of suppression by the ruling elite, the final battle is a like a labor strike writ large.\r\n\r\nthe final battle between good and evil is a battle between tribal good and the evil of feudal slavery. we are not suppose to have a riling elite that owns and labor class that works and must turn over the wealth they create to those who claim t be entitled to it. she spent a long time on that point. the tree of knowledge is the knowledge of feudalism, and the feudal scheme. the forbidden fruit is the transfer of wealth from labor to the elite owner class; it is the fruit of other people's labor that the first false kings (or feudal humans) were forbidden to consume.\r\n\r\nfeudal humans are a hybrid, we are tribal beings living in a feudal society. we must return to feudalism before globalization occurs since the feudal economics are incompatible with a \"closed ethical\" system.\r\n\r\nthe feudal slavery is the \"serpent\" that entered the tribal garden. capitalism is a feudal economic system, capitalism is the snake grown large. capitalism is the midgard serpent, the evil wrapping around the earth in the final days. its all real. \r\n\r\nthe eucharist was meant to teach us that we cannot take each other prosperity and call it interest and profit. to understand how bread and wine can be turned into flesh and blood, you only need to understand flesh and blood are first turned into bread and wine by the work of labor working with their own hands. to take claim the prosperity of people and consume it is to consume their lives and livelihood and cause them to suffer. it is a form of cannibalism. \r\nwe are not brute beasts. we are social animals confined in a feudal cage. we must become tribal again before it is too late\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

a room with a 2 sided view (almost 180 degree view) of the pamlico sound, and wa slying in my bed reading, it was about 2:30 am. i decided to turn off the lamp and go to bed, and was uncomfortably hot in bed, so i was lying with my eyes open. it had been perhas 10 to 15 minutes since i turned out my lamp, and the area outside (as well as inside) was very, completely dark (not many lights on the island, no streetlights). while atttemping to fall asleep, i saw a very very bright bluish-white object shoot out of the sound, heading from the southwest direction my feet were facing towards the northeast, heading over the island towards the ocean would be my guess. it trailed out of the water very quickly, but was very bright, bright enough to leave a \"tail\" behind it like a comet as it moved. i immediately recognized this as being odd and jumped up off of my bed and went to the window, but i could no longer see the object, as it had cleared the water and travelled away in such a short period of time. i stayed at the window and watched the vicintiy of the sound i could observe from my window, knowing this was a very odd thing to see. i had been searching the sky for about 5 minutes and was becoming hopeless i would see anything else out of the ordinary, when the object streaked back across my view and back into the sound, appearing to enter the water in th same vicinity of the area it had left. it also appeared just as bright as it had when i observed it leaving the water the same blueish white, same size, same characteritics, ect. it appeared to enter the water around the same 30-40 degree angle it had exited it at as well. after seeing it go back into the water, i woke up my girlfriend to tell her what i had witnessed. she did not believe me, however within a minute of the object re-entering the water and me waking her up, we both became aware of another light moving about the area. this was a circular, \"orb\" shaped object. whereupon the initial object i had seen exiting/entering the water had no distinct shape that i could observe, this new object was clearly spherical, and appeared to be larger than a softball but smaller than a basketball. it would appear in one object of the sky, blinking on and staying lit for indescriminate amounts of time, usually being lit with a white colored light for anywhere from 3-15 second intervals. the light it emmited was always white, however it changed in occurence and timing. it didnt blink, just came on and off the way a lightbulb or firefly would. this was no lighbulb or firefly however, one second we would observe it across the sound, and 15 seconds later it would be on the other side of the house, after another short period we would observe it somewhere else further or closer to us. i would say this object continued blinking on and off for about a 5 to 10 minute period, me and my girlfriend just watched it, wondering what it was, either of us figuring it out. we observed it \"blink on and off\" a total of probaly 20 to 25 times before it stopped. my girlfriend went back to bed after about 15 minutes of inactivity, i stayed up hoping to see it again but never did. i observed the next night and saw nothing. then, three days later, my stepfather struck up a conversation with the other guests at the house about a light he had seen the night earlier (the night of the 17th). he described seeing a blinking round object that would change location irratically, at one point being on this side of the island, only to blink out and reappear suddenly far away at other places on the island. he had seen our orb!!  me and m girlfriend immedialty told him what we had seen, it sounds like we both saw the same type of orb appearing and reappearing. he says he observed its activities for about 20 minutes from the porch outside before it dissapeared. he never saw any object enter or exit the sound though. he has never been open about ufo's or anysuch phenomena, and thinks it silly. i was very surprised when he told me without knowing what me or my girlfirend had seen a matching description of this object fluttering around, i think it genuinley had him baffled, and he is not one to be baffled easily. anyways, maybe it is worth checking out. i wonder if anybody else on the island this week has observed any of this activity, especially in or around the side of the pamlico sound.

as mine.  just noticed someone in same area had witnessed star-like formations in sky south of ottawa only yesterday (july 18, 2015 in ottawa/barrhaven).  the description appears to be similar to my own experience in november 1979 (only days before my near fatal car accident dec 2, 1979).  \r\ni was staying in an old farmhouse (being renovated/no phone) south of ottawa, ontario, canada. it was dark, late, don't know the exact time.  through the window i saw multi color-changing glowing star-like globes \"dancing\" in the sky doing perfect (and i mean perfect) geometrical formations i.E. bursting apart and coming together perfectly (50 - 100?, the sky was full of them).  i began to feel they were trying to communicate with me and i remember trying not to be scared, but i was alone in a desolate place.  every time i went to the window they were still there dancing-like in the sky.  eventually i laid down on the bed there (with the light on), wanting to sleep but i was too pumped!  i heard an unusual rather sonic \"helicopter\" sound in distance and approaching (never heard this exact sound before).  it hovered (extremely loud pulsating sound) directly above the roof where i lay and i became totally immobilized, unable to move anything.  it was so loud that the house shook.  all i could feel physically was my heart pumping extremely hard.  as my heart nearly exploded (literally!)i prayed and telepathically tried to communicate that please nothing appear or it will explode.  i heard a (male) voice speak \"she's not ready yet\", and the sonic helicopter sound (wooh wooh wooh) drifted off as it drifted in and i became able to move again.   i didn't know what time it was to begin with, so don't know if any time loss.  (i've kept this experience mostly to myself for many years, very few have heard).\r\ni had a different experience with a tall alien being earlier in the seventies.  he had a beautiful human like face with a huge bald head in a long burgundy gown. he communicated to me telepathically and cast an enormous feeling of peace that i can not describe. at the time, i remember being given understanding of everything, but now i don't know what that was!  it occurred in the same room that i was in and seemed very very real.  it was very inspiring experience, and i was shown my child son at least 16 years before he was born.  i will never forget it, but i think that could be too easily tossed off as a dream.","distance":"Over One

out diy job of renovating the old place as it was in desperate need of being done. the old wood and burnable trash we would cart down to the back of our long thin property and burn it on summer and fall evenings. we left it to grow wild down there and a small stream runs through, so it was a pleasant way to spend the evening. we would watch the fire,listen to the coyotes yipping by in packs,the frogs croaking and the toads trilling, crickets and bats, and of course, gazing in awe and wonder at the magnificent stars in our amazing universe. there was a lot of wood to burn so this had been a regular activity for us for the last 2 yrs. we had a unobstructed  view of the s. , se. and sw. sky. on one beautiful, clear, cloudless evening, sheila had put the our baby girl to bed,  brought down the crib monitor so we could hear if she was in distress and she joined me down at fire.  at one point in the late evening i was looking straight out the back yard up at the sky when i spotted 3 bright stars, forming a perfect equilateral triangle. i immediately found it very strange that i had never noticed this formation of stars before. they stuck out like a sore thumb in this section of sky that i had observed on so many previous evenings. they were bright, but not unlike the very brightest stars. they would also appear to contain elements of yellow, orange and red but predominantly bright white. i pointed them out to my wife. she said something to confirm that she saw the formation too and no sooner had the words left her mouth (they formed a triangle with point at the top and the bottom 2 points parallel to the horizon)the bottom point to the west shot west from a stand still to instantaneous high speed. and i don't mean jet fast. i mean meteor fast.  leaving what i assume is the same visual \"streak\" that you see when a meteor streaks through the sky and disappeared, too fast for our eyes to follow or perhaps really disappearing? then another one would shoot off in another direction and then the other one did the same thing. at the same time one of the other crafts/lights would suddenly appear as a streak and stop dead in the same place it took off from soon forming the triangle again.  then they they would streak off in different directions and one by one zip back, stop instantly only this time forming different formations.  inverted  \"l\"  front facing \"l\" laying down \"l\" and straight 3 dot lines, vertical. horizontal ,45 degrees. and back to triangle again.  this went on for 15 minutes or so, finally they simply zipped away and didn't return. during this event i'm sure i was standing there with my mouth agape. i was awe struck.  we both were. at one point i remember asking sheila \"are you seeing this too?\" she replied in the affirmative. i also had strong feeling that this was a show, just for our benefit. that the only purpose was for a display. i felt no fear but my wife admits to feeling apprehensive.  (being an amateur pilot i am some what familiar with planes and g forces.) at another point during the event i said to sheila \"we don't have stuff that does that.\"(meaning so obviously advanced technology) any human would dead instantly if not on take off for sure when they stop.  these things were going from zero to thousands of mph and thousands of mph to a sudden stop . i had never had much interest in flying saucers and space men and such since i was a kid. they just sort of faded away with all the challenges of life down here on earth.  when that 15 minute episode happened, 20 some odd years ago , our life and world view were changed forever. we have never had another encounter. i often wonder if there was a reason they showed for us or if we just happened to be in the right place at the right time. from then on you'll notice i'm always looking up,keeping my eyes on the skies!  i hope to have disclosure and an end to the truth embargo in my life time. it is the biggest,single most important discovery ever made on earth and people have a right to know the truth.  if those stupid, iron age, terrorist, divisive, superstitious, fairy tale, death cult religions can't handle it. too bad!!! where are the main stream scientists?  the proof is overwhelming at this point!  yet i'm still scoffed at by people when i tell my story.  most people are just like i was, consumed with the utter nonsense of the economy and world politics.  head placed firmly in the sand. kept in the dark.  the odd light news story presenting \"both sides\" temperature inversion, swamp gas, weather balloon indeed!.....Bilge!.

town of coates. i heard a low humming \r\nsound which got louder. i could feel a vibration all over my body. i looked\r\nout of the passenger window and saw a bright light at tree top level about\r\n200 feet away. i told my friend to stop the car and he started to get\r\nhysterical. i got a tire iron from under my seat and i was going to check\r\nit out. i got to the ditch and that is the last memory i had.\r\nafter undergoing hypnosis i was able to recall being hit by a blue beam\r\nwhich carried me to the craft, where a ramp opened, and i was brought in-\r\nside. a door opened and a tall grey with a normal sized grey entered. \r\nthe tall grey had on a black jumpsuit. then a human entered, also wearing\r\na black jumpsuit. he was smiling and said there was no reason to be afraid.\r\n\"this is going to be a pure learning experience\" and he brought me into the\r\ncockpit area and told me to look outside the windows. the windows were one\r\nway were i could see out, but the craft did not look like it had windows.\r\nhe showed me the control panel and how to operate it.  he took me into\r\nanother room where there were an assortment of monitors on the wall. he\r\nsaid to follow along with the images and they will teach you what you\r\nneed to learn. i watched the images for about 2 hours and somehow i was\r\nable to understand what i was watching. when he returned he told me it was\r\nvital that i understand these things because there may come a time when they won't be here to teach me. i would have to continue the big plan in their place. he said he didn't know when that time would be as there are many factors involved that could change the outcome. then the 2 greys came back in the room and the ramp opened up.The smaller grey escorted me out of the craft and to my car. he put a small device on the side of my head and i became paralyzed and my vision went black. the next thing i remember was me and my friend pulling into a restaurant.  we were both in a daze and couldn't figure out how the time got to be 5:30 am. so we had a large chunk of missing time. since that time my friend has received flashbacks but doesn't want to be involved in anyway.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

Rock","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"July 18, 2015, from about 7:30 pm to 8:40 pm (mountain time), my wife and i were sitting out in our front yard patio. neighbors in the town home next to us were having a small dinner party out on their front patio. \r\n\r\ni love colorado skies and i'm always sitting back and enjoying them. on this evening i looked up and saw a clear, sharp, black dot motionless in the sky. \r\n\r\ni thought it might be a hawk or an eagle soaring as we see that several times each month. but this was much, much higher than any bird i'd ever seen. and it was not moving the way a soaring bird does (where they move slightly in all directions as they hold onto the wind). this thing wasn't moving at all. that got my attention. \r\n\r\nso i asked my wife to look up and see it. she did also and we speculated as to why it appeared to not move. i was too curious so i ran through the house to the garage to get a small pair of binoculars from my car. \r\n\r\ni got back out front and it was still there. so i steadied the little binoculars against the edge of a front porch pillar and scanned until i found the object. through the binoculars i could see it much closer. \r\n\r\nin my mind i told my self it was two birds fighting or mating--but remarkably not moving through the sky. \r\n\r\nit *may* have been slowly rotating, in a clockwise direction from my point of view. it was still so far away i couldn't see details but i was able to see that it was squarish, and had angular sides, with at least one light. \r\n\r\nthe light was in the center and it was an orange-red. the squarish object was not perfectly clear but it appeared to be a square doughnut, with no doughnut hole. and instead of a tubular doughnut shape the tube was angular. \r\n\r\ni could see a few angular lines and that was about the only details i could see. \r\n\r\ndue to the distance and lack of clarity it was difficult to focus on the object while steadying the binoculars. \r\n\r\nthe object *may* have had three other much smaller, orange-red lights--but that may have also been a trick of the eye due to the bright light in the center. \r\n\r\nthe bright light in the center didn't make sense because it was so much brighter than any aircraft running light. this bright light did not appear to be a reflection of the sun. it appeared to be a light coming from the object. \r\n\r\nafter i'd looked at it with the binoculars i interrupted our neighbor's dinner party and asked them to look up into the sky at the black object. they did and when they saw it. i believe i remember them commenting on how it didn't appear to be moving in the sky. \r\n\r\nat this time i noticed that it had in fact been moving, slowly from se to sw--but not so that movement could be seen.\r\none of the neighbors said that it was probably a drone. although, as a sometimes curious former soldier (honorable discharge), i do look up drones and such but have never seen one anything like this object''s shape. \r\n\r\ni told them \"we're probably being watched,\" and one of them waved to the object as if to say hello.\r\n\r\none of the people at the neighbor's dinner party got out their cell phone and was either taking pictures or video. \r\n\r\ni realized i wanted photos so i ran into the house, went upstairs and got my cell phone (iphone 6 plus). \r\n\r\nwhen i got back the object was just going behind clouds. it appeared again and i took three photos and a video--all steadied against the porch pillar as i had done with the binoculars. then the object was no longer visible. \r\n\r\nwe stayed outside enjoying the evening about another 30 or 40 minutes and i kept watching to see if i could see it again. however the sun had set and the cloud mass high in the sky was such that it would continue to block visibility of the object if it kept going in the same direction. \r\n\r\nin the morning as i write this, i'd emailed the photos and video to my computer (in their original resolution), and i cannot see the object--even zooming in with photoshop. but i'm not an expert with photography so it may be there but i just can't see it. and i might not be looking in the exact right place.\r\n\r\ni copied one of the photos and marked it up with approximate flight path, the date and some notes. \r\n\r\nthe object seemed to become smaller from the beginning to the end of viewing it. so from that i believe that while it was heading something like se to sw (in our view) it was also heading more south, or gaining altitude. \r\n\r\npersonal editorial\r\n\r\nthis didn't seem like anything extraterrestrial or paranormal to me. it wasn't really any kind of experience. \r\n\r\nother than the object moving so slowly that it seemed not to be moving, everything seemed normal as if it was an aircraft we could normally experience-but never had. \r\n\r\ni'm open to some ideas such as there is probably life on all the other gajillion planets out there but i'm skeptical that they would be able to find earth among the stars, and/or that they would care about earth and us. \r\n\r\ni'm also skeptical about government cover-ups and conspiracies as i believe it's almost impossible for anyone to keep a secret--especially in our information age where anyone and everyone would do anything to expose a government secret to gain fame or wealth.

object to the north. this object was white, glowing, and easily 3-4x brighter than any star and 2-3x brighter than any observed planet. once i noticed it, i turned my attention to this object. as i watched it, it went from bright to very faint within a matter of seconds, as if accelerating away from my viewing position. within 10-15 seconds it was no longer viewable at all. i was able to see other stars in the sky in the area of this object, so it did not seem to move behind cloud cover. i stayed outside for another 20 minutes to see if i was able to observe the object again, but never was able to see anything in that direction that would replicate what i observed (allowing for there to be clouds i could not see). this is a phenomenon i have not previously observed in that direction prior and found it to be significant enough to file a report. i make no assumptions about what i saw, but it was definitely not a previously known aircraft. distance would have to have been greater than 3-5 miles from my position as an estimate, although i cannot know for certain. winds were light and variable and practically unobserved at the time of the incident. the light either grew faint until it could no longer be detected by the naked eye or accelerated away from my position in a straight line. i have observed aircraft, satellites, and the iss before, but this behaved differently than anything i have seen. it was stationary until it diminished from my viewing position.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

mexico every year and stay for a month. we have been staying at the same address and same condo for the past five years. we often see coast guard and military helicopters fly along the coastline during the day and sometimes hear them after sunset. we often sit on the deck which faces west and watch the sunset. we also see many aircraft flying into tampa bay airport. this year, 2015, we witnessed some spectacular lightening storms over the gulf. on the horizon we also see three or four oil rigs but usually only when the tide is low. we cannot actually see the rigs but rather the lights coming off of them. where we live in kamloops, canada we are surrounded by mountains and we have often seen falling stars or meteors flash through the sky. in ten years living here i have personally seen over one hundred. i am only sharing my information with you because of a recent television show called hanger 1 and am wondering if anyone else may have come forward with similar information. i am not one who truly believes in ufo's but i am open to the possibility. my wife and i feel that we saw something completely unexplainable last year in may. we were sitting on our deck, fifth floor, talking and listening to the sound of the waves (we do not drink or do drugs) when we noticed a very fast moving reddish light streak across the sky. it had a meteor like similarity, which is what we thought at first until we noticed a second one. slower moving than a meteor but extremely fast. i have seen a few military jets but this was twenty or more times as fast. we were still looking west as it completely disappeared when another one went past, almost in the same orbit and flight path. it was to the south and appeared to be moving east to west before disappearing. there were three or four more spaced about 10-15 seconds apart, same orbit, speed and path, then disappeared.  after the fourth one i ran across our condo unit while my wife stayed on the deck and i opened our front door which faces east and stood on an outside landing looking at the eastern sky. two more objects streaked past. they were also noticed by my wife from the other side. then we saw nothing more but waited. they looked like they were streaking past over the oil rigs but judging the distance is extremely difficult. the sky was cloudless, the sun had already set and it was around 10-11pm. there was no sound or any trailing. even a meteor has a bit of a trailing streak but is usually white in color. the objects were very consistent in appearance and color. we were both very excited to witness this but even more when i went to watch the eastern sky. they just appeared the same way they disappeared. we talked about this for days and i documented the sighting on some website although i cannot remember what the website was.  what motivated me to share this is the show hanger 1. i believe that if more honest people shared there sightings we would be able to know more regarding the unknowns of this world. i am more convinced because of your show and the fact that many people like police officers and military personnel come forward witnessing these events from different places and areas. thanks.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was 6 years old (now 19) and i shared a room with my parents.It was very hot and humid in the summer in boston and my parents left the window slightly open. since it was so muggy, muggies than i was used to since this was our first summer in boston, i could not sleep and i was fussing in bed. i believe my parents had fallen asleep since they don't remember this incident. i remember feeling more fussy than usual and the lights of the city outside our apartment in the 3rd or 4th floor were bothering me so i kept trying to get under my bedsheets without letting them heat me up (but on top of it as a kid i had a phobia of not being covered by anything in the night so i was still under my bedsheets. for some reason i remember that the wrinkles in my bedsheets combined with the lighting and my imagination looked like angry faces so i turned away from them and towards the closet. between my bed and the closet there was a walk space (about 3 feet wide, the floor was light wood). as i turned and opened my eyes i noticed a figure under the covers- my head my under the covers and as the covers settled there was something else under them but far enough for some of the covers to settle between us obscuring my vision. immediately i moved the covers (they were pink and the lights outside as i remember them were strong enough to shine through and allow me to see this body, so now as i'm retelling the story i wonder if the sheets distorted the color of the body). when i created enough space under the covers to see the figure i noticed the following things: \r\n1. i was not particularly panicked which is strange since alien stories freaked me out as a kid. in fact for the time that i observed it (a few seconds before i reacted) it all felt very natural, even less shocking than if i had found my mom next to me, just startling and unexpected.\r\n2. the creature had skin but it seemed moist the way a human's does when sweaty from a harsh fever but on top of it cold, very muggy maybe even mucousy. it was a bit wrinkly around the face/head.\r\n3. it was moving in a way that reminds me of shivery breathing but i don't remember a nose or whether or not but was actually breathing the way we do. so i felt as though it were experiencing something like cold sweat fever chills.\r\n4. it's eyes were closed and the eyelids were very large, wide set, wrinkly. i could tell the eyes must portrube a bit from its forehead.\r\n5.The shape of the face and head was kinda cat like if cats did not have fur. particularly because it got larger and wider toward the top, and i could dimly see two folds of skin at either side that were tucked wrinkled against the main head structure. i describe them to myself to look like car ears if they had no cartilagous structure, were not perky and were set further to the front of the head. i'm not even entirely sure if it had a nose or mouth because i could see the skin had a different fold around those areas but i could not distinguish if there was actually any openings.\r\n6. the creatures body was very thin and insubstantial, he must have been around the same size as me (4 feet?), it looked bipedal but i didnt really see anything below its (waist?).\r\n7. arms were limp and folded in front of it, it had digits that looked thin and long but i don't remember how many, just that they were also folded at the wrist and curled.\r\n8.The skin color was light grayish-greenish, and shiny again as if it was very sweaty.\r\n9.I knew it was alive but had a sense its health was not well, it seemed barely aware of me if aware at all, almost as if it was passing out or extremely exhausted.\r\n10. it was not wearing any clothes of any sort.\r\n\r\ncontinuing the story after this recognition, which only happened within a few seconds however adrenaline must have kicked in because my heart was beggining to beat faster as i was realizing how unusual it was, and yet in my memory everything seemed to slow down. after that moment, i reacted by  pushing my arms out in front of me and flat against his very narrow chest. i heard a thump on the ground proper to something organic hitting the ground (not a solid thump like when a phone falls nor a squishy one like when food falls, it sounded like a moistened body). i felt as though telling my parents would be too much trouble or as if telling them would not comfort me in any way, i just accepted what happened and thought that it was such an indescribable and unusual thing that i would always be alone with it. i know that after this i quickly turned around toward the window again, however i cannot imagine that i could have slept immediately- i've always been one to lie awake recounting and analyzing thoughts, especially from something this eventful.I have no recollection of falling asleep or anything. the next thing i am able to recall is that i woke up later than usual and everyone including parents and brother were up. this was strange because they would normally wake me up to begin the day with me, it was a sunday. when i got up i went to look at where i had heard the body fall and noticed a (estimating 2 feet long, half a foot wide) moist pring on the floor similar to the one a person might leave if they had sweat on a shiny floor. i touched it and it was muggy and cool. i went to wash my hands and don't remember any textures... i just avoided the \"thump\" spot after that. i asked my mom if someone had spilt something but when she said no i simply did not want to bring up the subject. i did not expect anyone to validate my experience for what it was and i put it off from my mind. i remember and have written the experience down periodically so the details do not become obscured. but the ones i have written here come to mind clearly without having to look back at things i wrote as a kid. since then when the conversation of weird childhood experiences comes up with my social circles i have retold this experience,but my parents only seem to remember me telling them this a few times. my dad and i both remember that once we really went in depth with the experience while eating pizza at a costoco's and they asked me to draw the alien on a napkin. i don't have that napkin in my possesion. i have only written down details that i feel confident i remember and left out any ones that are too hazy or that i'm not certain of. in my life after this experience i have had other very very hazy memories that i could not be sure of as real or not. i just have the feeling that was not the only time i had an interaction with a non human intelligent being. none of these feel negative. i have another slightly clear memory when i was 15, but i will not report it because i'm not sure it wasn't a dream- but after it i had a weird skin reaction that i still get sometimes, and things in my room felt misplaced. at that point in my life i had been a vivid dreamer for some time. so i feel as though it is all too inconclusive to report as a certain and solid memory. anyway, i am finally reporting this experience so the details do not get fuzzier, and because i finally felt more trusting of mufon.Thank you so much for taking this experience, i am very interested in that it serves a positive role in the purpose of understanding these phenomena. i am willing to be contacted and interviewed, asled to redraw my imopression of it (since i dont have one at the time to submit) but only at my permission and if it is clear no negative repercussions may come of it. i appreciate this truth-seeking purpose very much. i would also be very interested to know how this report is used and if i can access any media that utilizes it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),
