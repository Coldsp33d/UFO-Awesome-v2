the video of the april 28 san diego mistaken ufo sighting came to my mind. the lights were star-like and the brightest approached jupiter-like magnitude. then i realized that the lights could not be a tower as they went to high up from the horizon and they were slowly moving. some orbs moved up, others moved down and some stayed fairly stationary. at one moment, one orb began to accelerate fairly quickly downwards and it made a triangular from with the two closest orbs. i began to think of what else it could be, but the absence of any beacon, strobe or green lights meant these were not aircraft of some sort. the orbs that did move did so in a smooth manner and didn't show any sort of organized stucture in respect to the other orbs (aside form the triangle). the 2 other people i was with were intrigued and quite excited to see the lights and neither they nor i could come up with an explanation of what we were seeing. after 3-4 minutes the orbs began to fade, almost as if they were moving away from us and heading into the far away clouds. they all dissappeared one by one until one was left; the brightest one, moving upwards from near treetop hight and slowly getting fainter. seeing that the event was nearly over, we got in the car and left for home.\r\n \r\nthe only logical explination we could make in the car was that the lights were chinese ballons, yet the orbs did not move with the easterly winds at that time and they stayed fairly stationary.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":68315,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.2751549,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07192015-0005","longitude":-75.74984599999999,"occurred":1437253800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1437269649000,"summary":"Series of orbs hovering and slowly changing direction then fading away.","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/68315_submitter_file1__20150719012905.png","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/68315_submitter_file2__20150719012720.png"],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Ottawa, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:18169"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Rome","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Apeared in sky ,hoverd about 5 seconds then took off to the west.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":68314,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.233051381931894,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07192015-0004","longitude":-85.17934336282053,"occurred":1434664860000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1437269386000,"summary":"Hovered in sky then for 10 seconds then went west extrmely fast.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":36,"maxtempi":96,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":29,"meantempi":84,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":22,"mintempi":71,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":36,"maxtempi":96,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":29,"meantempi":84,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":22,"mintempi":71,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"30165","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":30,"locationName":"Rome, Georgia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:18170"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were outside at home sitting around a campfire. it was 10:30, the sky was clear, calm and quiet. i was facing south and noticed a bright orange light traveling west. i pointed it out to the rest of my family. all stood up and watched it travel across the sky apparently changing direction towards the south west until we lost it behind trees. we noticed no noise. it appeared to be flying at an altitude of roughly 500 to 1000 feet. it had no red or green marker lights or strobes standard on conventional aircraft. from our location we heard no engine or motor sound. the object was much brighter than venus and larger as well.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":68313,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.5562307,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07192015-0003","longitude":-105.7768174,"occurred":1437258600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1437268951000,"summary":"Bright yellow orange object, changing in brightness, south of our location, flying west, then appearing to change direction towards the south west.

taunton. the time was approx 3.30am (friday), the sky is clear & dimly starlit and we were heading to our hometown of newbury, berkshire.\r\n\r\nall of the sudden a large aircraft appeared, rising over the bank to the left hand side of the motorway. it appeared to be launching & aligned itself with the motorway and proceeded to pass directly overhead of our vehicle. the motorway itself was very quiet of any other traffic. i slowed, as we watched in disbelief, for above us sat this very large, rectangular craft which was distinguishable by the many round white lights (of differing sizes) to its underbelly. due to the time of day, it was not possible to see specific colourings of the craft itself but we both knew that we had never seen the like of this anywhere before.\r\n\r\ni pulled over to the side of the road for a moment and we stood by the car for a while, just watching. there was no audible 'engine' sound emiting from this craft. it progressed in a straight linefor upto approx 40 miles (i estimated this to be around the bristol area and roughly in line with the m4 (running eastwards towards london). here, it appeared to stop & hover momentarily before progressing eastwards, without physically turning. what was also remarkable about this was the exceedingly rapid acceleration in speed and ascending projectory that it then took.\r\n\r\nmy friend & i were back in the car and speechless, still watching as the craft sped off into the distance and space itself, before disappearing from our sight.\r\n\r\nwe couldn't explain what we had seen but knew that it was not an aircraft of this world. yet have never reported the sighting anywhere until today, for fear of ridicule and the liklihood of not being believed at the time (particularly as neither of us had the means for photographic evidence at the time). it is, however, an experience which i carry with me as clearly as if it happened yesterday and is how i know that we are not alone in this universe. i believe it is important to record this event, particularly given that this craft was neither spherical, saucer or cigar shaped (as many reported ufo sightings appear to be).","distance":"101-500 Feet,

the sides making it a boomerang. naturally, this ufo is in the flight path of memphis international airport. after observing it for two minutes, it was just hovering. there were no blinking strobes or

california area may 14, 2014.  several of them could be seen from my home.\r\nthe following seven photos were taken a few months later (at the same time of day), after feeling compelled to document what i witnessed that day around 1pm. i feel it would take too long to describe the details, so i have pasted white pieces of paper to the photos to show what i saw.  the photos are in order and numbered. besides this written account, descriptions are pasted on reverse of each photo.     \r\n\r\nphoto #2 . . . a friend and i were looking at smoke from four of those fires when i spotted what looked like, at first, a balloon.  for about 10 seconds i watched as it bobbed up, down and around in an area beyond the nearby mobile home roofs, on the other side of a couple housing developments, and past a stand of trees near a golf course about 2 miles away.  my companion soon spotted the object.  if my friend wishes to make a report of this sighting that remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nphoto #3 . . . .  after observing this object bobbing and weaving, i noticed it ascending and coming to a stop.  i thought it may be a balloon of sorts i am not familiar with and it was probably tethered.  it hovered motionless while i was wishing i was closer to get a better look.  within two seconds i could tell it was on the move, straight for us.  i thought for sure as it approached we would begin to recognize the object and soon hear it.\r\n\r\nphoto #4 . . . it was getting closer, but i still did not know what it was.  a radiantly brilliant pure white object.  i wondered what it was made of, for the sun to reflect off of it without sending a reflection back. it appeared to be perfectly round.  was it round or flat?  no sound approaching.  \r\n\r\nphoto #5 . . . in the 3 seconds it took to reach us, it was obvious the object was not tethered.  nothing was pushing or pulling the craft.   i could not see any means of propulsion or guidance.  no wings, flaps or aerials.  no insignias or markings of any kind. no windows.  no pulsing lights.\r\n\r\nphoto #6 . . .  turning on my heels, i watched it go past us.  the photo shows where it stopped and remained for about 5 seconds.  without a point of reference, it’s hard to know precisely how high it was.  it seems it had not gained much altitude from the time it left the trees, so my guess is around 1,000 feet, but possibly less.  i still could not hear a motor or even a whirring sound, just silence. i also had not seen any change in the structure; still just perfectly round and very bright white, as though a light were coming from inside to illuminate the exterior.  although the sun was now behind the object, it remained just as luminous as when i thought possibly the sun had possibly been reflecting on it to make it so radiant.  it’s hard to know if the object was round like a ball or flat, as it  looked the same throughout this sighting.\r\n\r\nphoto #7 . . .  the object moved slightly to our right.  i was thinking it seemed to be curious about us.  i was thinking maybe it was going to come closer.  i was also thinking “are you crazy?”  it hung there for about 4 seconds then disappeared.  just blinked out.  my friend asked if i had seen what they had seen.  we discussed the options of what it could have been, concluding we had witnessed an object flying in the sky that we could\r\nnot identify.

almost to the corner of chippawa right by the church there when i saw the object.  i pulled into their parking lot to watch it and it got smaller then disappeared from view after only a couple min. i am into ufology and was looking at the sky for fun as i went up 933, thinking it would be neat to see a ufo, but did not actually expect to see anything.  when i first saw it the ufo just seemed to fade in!  it was a few inches long at the distance i was viewing it from (estimate about a mile) and it was very bright, intensity was near half the intensity of the sun.  someone else had to see it.  i pulled into the church lot at this point to watch it.  from my perspective it seemed to travel wnw while gaining altitude till it hit the cloud deck and faded from view.  by the time it hit the clouds it looked much smaller and dimmer.  my son (who was at work and did not see it) said i saw a plane reflecting the sun, but to me the flight path and size rule this out.  while i am not a trained observer we have lived here for over 30 years and i am very familiar with aircraft in general.  i am familiar with many objects in the sky that commonly get filmed or photographed as ufo's but are in-fact explainable as bolide meteors, ball lightning and yes, even missidentified aircraft.  i am even familiar with many different plasma effects that even now science is still trying to puzzle out (norway has some good research in this area).  i am confident this was not any of those.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

grateful dead concerts). in the afternoon i mentioned to a new friend how i would love to see some orb lights, as has happened at other events. i also mentioned that when these anomalies occurred, i would observe only some attendees in the crowd witness along with me, while many others did not seem to notice...\r\nok, fine. at around dusk, my new friend and i were in the south parking lot listening to the music with a smattering of other fans who also did not get into the show. he and i saw an orange light rise over the arena and i said that it could be an orb, or simply a chinese lantern, but if it exhibited strange behavior like changes in apparent size or direction, or was joined by others to make ubiquitous triangle shapes, etc: then we have something to work with!...\r\nthe light moved west a little and faded out, and was followed by a pair of orange lights which appeared to rise either from the venue itself or from further north, passing over. these two 'objects' also drifted west a short distance before vanishing. i said i wasn't confident to make a determination but that if they reappear, well, you get the idea.\r\n they did not reappear, and we began to converse with the folks standing next to us. it was strange because even though we were all looking in the same direction (north), they did not see any phenomena over the coliseum! that being said,the one girl closest to me was confident that it was chinese lanterns. \"wait\" i said, \"you saw chinese lanterns?!?\"... \"no, you did\", she replied. \r\n \"hold on, what did you see?\" i asked her boyfriend... \"i didn't see anything\", he said. \r\n\"so, we're all standing here, looking there (pointing to the arena) and nobody else saw anything?\"... \r\n\"you're telling me that you didn't see anything up there, but you know what i saw?\"... \r\n\"yes\", she said confidently. i turned back to my friend, \"see what i mean?\"\r\n -so that's that. \r\nit was not as amazing as other

outside for a smoke. \r\n\r\ni didn't write down the exact date but it was in 1998 or 1999. i remember it was a little chilly outside but not yet fall. evenings can be chilly up here even in july or august so it had to be around that time of the year. \r\n\r\nwe were just standing there talking and looking up at the sky when we witnessed something very odd high up in the sky. \r\n\r\nnone of us said a word to each other we were too awestruck at what we were looking at. i might add that none of us believed in ufos or aliens and had we not seen what we saw with our own eyes none of us would have believed it. \r\n\r\nwhat we saw was a gigantic craft of triangular shape and it appeared as black as night without any reflection or shine on the surface. it had three bright red lights on each corner on the triangular shape. i remember them as pulsating but not very rapidly.\r\n\r\nit was just sitting up there in the sky perfectly still and without making any sound. then suddenly it flew in a straight line to one direction, then the opposite and up and down with such incredible speed  that no known aircraft would possibly be able to do. in just one blink of an eye it traveled from a far distance just underneath the clouds to a position through the clouds a distance that would take a commercial airplane at least 30 seconds of reaching. it was like they were showing off or something having fun up there and wanting to be seen. \r\n\r\nit went on like that for few minutes snd then it just took off straight into the sky and was gone in the blink of an eye. \r\n\r\nconsidering the altitude of the craft it had to be gigantic because of how much of it was detectable from the ground maybe hundreds of kilometers away. that moment changed my life and how i look at the world we live in. i've been absolutely fascinated by ufos and alien encounters ever since. this is the first time i'm speaking out about what we saw because i didn't think anyone would be interested in it.
