my bedroom on the second floor of my house. the sun was starting to set. my car went up to the window resting.I went to pretty her and noticed a bright light in the sky. thought it was odd something so bright when no other stars were out. it started to get brighter.I noticed it didn't move for five min. so i grabbed my cellphone and started filming. during filming i got a little shaky and filmed the best i could. called out to my aunt down stairs which you can hear in the video. the video lasted 3 mins because my phone died. a min or so after my phone died my aunt came up stairs and we both were surprised and a little shaken. the object got brighter and hovered. i told her keep watching it and i am going to grab my binoculars from the next room. as i looked through i noticed it was oval in shape and had three to four twinkling/pulsating lights. as we passed back and forth the binoculars, the white lights turned a red-orange color and stayed like that for about the minutes. next brightened white and turned grewn-blue similar to an old christmas light bulb. this lasted for about three mins as well before it flared back to white. after min 20 in the blink of an eye out shoot to my right (north). my aunt and i heard and saw a black helicopter with a red flashing light zoom from our left bottom corner of the window (south east). the helicopter disappeared from sight. the orb/light (s) moved further in the distance. by this time the sun was completely down. noticed the orb/light get further away. a little after 9:30pm we couldn't see anything.","distance":"Over One

as we did often in the open air on a tarp. some time in the night (i am unsure of the exact time) i remember waking up in my mind but i had no control over my body. i thought it was morning because there was such bright light i could see through my i lids. i couldn't move. i then as if told or controlled my eyes opened slowly to see an orb hovering above my face. it then moved down the length of my body. when it got to my waist i began to sit up still almost beyond my control. i watched the orb float/hover over to the fence ascend up and the hover above the fence about ten feet away from me. the notion crossed my mind (i think now i was being told) to wake my cousin so we could both see it. but when i looked to her she was already awake looking at me. with out a word after a few seconds of staring at each other we both at the exact same time looked back to the craft and watched as it then changed from a singular orb of light to a domed disc shape with three lights that rotated around it's widest circumference. i dont know how long we were looking at it. the entire time the wind seemed to spin around us almost contained to the immediate area there was a low humming nose and an over all feeling of love and comfort. its the best i have felt in my entire life the safest i have felt my entire life. after a while it changed from three lights to one bright orb of light moved along the top of the fence and then moved with incredible speed away from the yard and over the field behind my home. at that instance the hum and wind were suddenly gone and i fell immediately back to sleep. i did't ask my cousin about it until 7 years latter where she told me she remembered and yes it happened she said it sounds like we were abducted. we have discussed only a few times what we each believed happened but we both feel as though some one has been watching us since then on.\r\nthis is not the only orb i have seen and not the only experience i had but i feel this is the start of everything in my life i really want answers and to find out what i might not remember. \r\n\r\ni have been to afraid to report early but now i feel it is time.","distance":"20 Feet or

what i was seeing because the first thing that came to mind was a ufo because it was not anything of a ordinary flying object that's man made. the object itself looked like it was made of ruby, like a jewel, it had 4 solid circle beams of light that was gold colored and bright that surrounded the dome cylinder shaped bottom but the light that projected the beam that came down appeared to come from the center of the object. it was in view for about a a minute or longer. to my amazement i just stared as it blinked in and out i was trying to phathom what i was seeing while trying to stay safe on the road. there was no other vehicles on the road besides a truck in the distance behind me. i didn't think about stopping but i slowed down so i could go to my camera on my cell phone to capture what i could before it left my view. one picture came out purple i don't know if it was because my hand covered the camera i don't know but the other picture shows a glimpse of part of what it was. i don't believe that there will ever be enough technology to fully capture the true essence of what had appeared, it was from another dimension not of this world. it is complex to describe because what my

not sure if this even qualifies as a ufo sighting but i did not know who else to report this to. it was about 5:00pm yesterday afternoon, i was standing outside on my back porch, the sky was clear i had been sitting in the sun throughout the day and pulling weeds out of the garden earlier. so as i was standing there, out of nowhere the was a loud sound similar to a jet or a large plane at first but it suddenly got much louder and sounded like a missile or a bomb dropping? i have never heard one personally but it was the only comparison i can think of right now.?  \r\n\r\nit was so deafeningly loud and i could feel the base from it in my body and in the ground. i was so afraid that our entire city was about to be blown up that i ran inside and tried to get my family into the basement. my mother and girlfriend heard  the noise as well \r\n \r\nit sounded like something getting closer and closer and then there was nothing, i kept wairing for a shockwave or something, i was terified. after i felt like it was okay and caught my breath, i went back upstairs to be laughed at and told it was probably just a plane, i looked around, out front , out back, every direction and i could not see a plane or vapour trail of any kind anywhere. we live close to a local airport so i hear a lot of planes and have been to air shows and am very familiar with the sound of commercial jets and military jets and small air crafts, the sound i heard was nothing like that or nothing i have ever heard in person. \r\n\r\ni contacted my father in pickering , 2 cities to the west , about 40km away and asked him if he had heard anything, he stated not at all other than the pickering nuclear power plant air raid sirens being tested in the late morning that day. i have no idea if there is any correlation or reason that this sound occurred on the same day, i just thought that small detail could be relevant or may be the underlying cause.? \r\n\r\ni wish i could have seen the object or get some answers as to what could have caused such a loud sound or what kind of object could even create that sound, i would also like to know if anyone else in my area reported this noise? \r\n\r\ni am available for further questioning but i am currently restricted from leaving my residence i'm accordance to my probation right now, i have an ankle bracelet on so i'm not able to leave but you can reach me by phone and email. i do not answer to blocked callers or private numbers, i find it helpful to screen my calls. \r\n\r\nthank you in advance, and i hope this letter is not a waste of

traveling to the east.  at that point i suggested we go outside and take another look.  the skies at night in this rural texas location  are bright, as there is little light pollution.  we talked about what he saw, watching the skies as we talked.  after a few minutes my grandson said, \"there's another one!\"  he pointed out a moving light in the sky.  the object was star-like, a small dot of light.  when i saw it, watching it move in a straight line for about ten seconds, i told my grandson that it was a satellite because it moved in a straight line, and no sooner did i say that then the light slowed down, then zipped to the east almost in a perpendicular angle.  the object, star-like, zig zagged toward the eastern horizon and then passed out of sight.  when first observed the object flew on a direct path almost due south to north, at about 50 degrees above the horizon.  the object appeared to be flying far, far above the normal flight path of regular commercial jet traffic common

festival in manchester tn june 14, 2013. it had to of been pretty late at night because we had recently come back to our camp site after seeing paul mccartney (the last set of the night i believe). we had not done any drugs or had drank recently as we were worn out from the drinking earlier the day before, we had taken some adderall but we both had a prescription for it so the effects were no different then any other day and if anything would cause us to be more alert and observant. we were sitting in his car just talking for awhile trying to get away from the chaos for a bit and as he was speaking to me i kept looking  out of the passenger side window at the stars. since we were basically on a farm and there were no clouds you could see way more stars then you usually would in the bright city. at one point i looked out and i noticed what i thought were 3 bright stars in a triangular shape until i saw them move! they would be completely still in suspension/hovering and then would just move in a random direction very quickly and perfectly(right, straight down, and then straight up etc.). when i say \"still\" i mean there was no bobbing or anything as they moved like maybe a helicopter would do, so i don't think air resistance was involved or a contributing factor to it's flight(the \"ship\" or what ever didn't seem to need to be aerodynamic), just perfect intended straight lines and then solid very controlled stillness in the air as if that spot in the air was supporting them like the ground would or how actual stars are still and stuck in their positions in the sky(from our perspective). this is necessary to mention because the \"stars/lights\" them selves were not necessarily still, they appeared to move or morph while in sky (i don't know why but i had an impression that it was to make the movement more fluid or something maybe balancing the energy i don't know). while all three continued to appear connected ( by invisible edges) they would seem to move geometrically such as the triangle would become more acute or obtuse (coming forward, backwards, sideways) at certain points but would always stay connected. generally they stayed within a smaller area in the sky as they moved around, if i were to put my hands up in the sky to measure the distance,from my perspective it would be the equivalent of about a foot between two hands in the sky and it looked pretty high so i guess that would probably pan out to a distance of a couple miles if i have to guesstimate. another thing we both noticed was that the space occupied in between the star-like lights while transparent or invisible seemed to distort light a little bit like the way heat does rising from hot pavement, this was another reason for us to believe that they were connected. we watched this for a minute or so when it suddenly (for lack of a better word) beamed away in an instant, almost like it got sucked away from the space it was in, essentially vanishing. we were both in aw and also i think grateful to be with each other at the time to verify our sanity. oddly enough my boyfriend seemed to get over it rather quickly as i on the other hand was practically in a trance looking at that same space in the sky that the lights disappeared from. i noticed something really strange start to become visible to me after it \"beamed\" away, it was like a huge grid system way up in the atmosphere connecting everything, i had never seen this before but i felt a weird sense of understanding or familiarity with it when i saw it, like i knew somehow intuitively that the \"light ship\" thing i just saw worked with that grid some how, it was a very strange yet satisfying feeling and i just kind of accepted it at the time. when our other friends came back to the camp site an hour or so later i yelled from my tent what we had saw earlier and asked if they had seen it also. in their drunken' stupor they laughed at the idea and patronizingly suggested that we were probably drunk and saw something as mundane as some lanterns in the sky(out of all the possibilities), at which point it was clear to me that it was not worth our time to share such an experience with them and went to bed.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

appearing behind me in the distance. at first i thought it was a car, then we saw (other two people were in the car with me at that moment) the light coming closer to us and then moving from the street to the field at its left in a horizontal way. the light was still pointing at us but it was moving right to left, like if it wasn't touching the street. after a bit we saw a car driving to the opposite direction, and when the car reached the light (that at that moment it looked like it was back on the street) both turned off. after few seconds we saw the light appearing again. few minutes later a big truck got between us and the light and few minutes later the truck disappeared and the light was back again behind us. it took off a bit (like if it was flying) and then it came back on the street. sometimes it was changing shape and after disappearing for a longer time we saw three lights on the field at our left. then two lights disappeared and the one that was still on came back on the street like if it was fluctuating few feet from the street (from left to right). few other cars came from the opposite direction and some of them were disappearing as soon as they were close to that light while some of them were just passing by it. the street was perfectly straight, no bumps, no turns. all of the sudden it got really close to us and when another car, coming from another direction, passed us by, the light turned off and the object got hit by the other car's lights and i could see a conical disk behind us. dark violet/black color, as large as the the lane of the street. once we started approaching ely, the light disappeared for good.\r\nwe made a video but it's too dark to see anything.
