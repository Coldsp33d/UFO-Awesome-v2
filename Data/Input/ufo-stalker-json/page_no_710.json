sober as a rock.I noticed a craft in the sky over the ocean that was so big you would have to be blind to miss it . first thing i thought was ufo i have never seen a craft that could match the size and magnitude of the object. it was not concerned about making its presence discreet . the craft appeared to be rectangular from the point of view i witnessed from . it had about 8-10 bright rectangular lights emitting an extremely powerful white colored spectrum of light . it was miles out to sea and i would estimate it at 3000ft or less in altitude from sea level . it was hovering looking out toward ocean (east ) the lights would flash in a distinct pattern skipping one in a direction from left to right . appears as if there were other colors like blue and red and gold around the perimeter of rectangular white lights during sequence . there was a light mist in the air that the reflection of the light was capturing causing it to illuminate the area around it slightly . within minutes sky clears up. while hovering the was another object very close that was much smaller ( gold orange orb) moving slowly around the object sometimes changing directions . smaller object was pulsating sometimes getting very bright. after 15 min of being stationary the object started moving close to shore at a consistent super smooth rate . headed north and north west . no sound could be heard . i'd say it got to within a mile off shore . looks as if smaller object attached or entered larger object during the move. it was no longer visable. i was very exited at first but at the same time .. i've seen ufos on other occasions .Lbit nothing has ever compared to the magnitude and visibility of this expired. intrigued but cautious it made me feel uneasy . it felt as if it was going to be something out of war of the world or independence day . i tried to take some picture . came out blurry from my vantage point . i quickly alerted the people i was with and they witnessed along with at least 30-40 other people . somebody has footage or a picture i am sure of it. mind blown . the girls i was with were getting agitated because we had not left yet . after about 30 min of observation i had left although i did not want to miss a second. i uploaded pics . poor photo quality .","distance":"Over One

approximately 70 degrees elevation,heading to the ne. i was stunned by it's speed but immediately recognized that it was not a meteor (too dim and unvarying in it's light, which was sort of dim, and not a satellite (moving far too fast). it's path was arrow straight, unvaried, and disappeared behind that stupid redwood in the back yard, not reappearing on the other side. the angle of my view would prevent that. the object was too dim to be a meteor and, more importantly,seemed to be more than just one light. it happened very quickly (maybe only three seconds, if that) but my impression was of a triangle of three dim, sort of muted lights. there was no noise whatever. i waited for the delayed noise of a very high-flying jet but there was none. it was, of course, impossible to tell it's altitude but my impression was that it was miles overhead, which made it's apparent speed all that much more remarkable. my feelings? awe! my reactions? wow, i thought, that ain't us! we don't

myself, brother, and cousin had seen over 35 years ago, and now, myself and thirty five year old nephew saw the exact same thing!  07/03/15, approximately 9:30 a.M., not a cloud in the sky we both saw this thing not more than 1000 yards from my house!  we both saw this thing hovering over clear creek just south of my house: \r\nwe had just headed south on fm 2164, from our driveway, headed to work.  i looked down the road, toward the clear creek bridge crossing, and saw this long, 300’ plus object in the sky, just above the tree line on southeast side of the bridge.  about 800 yards was the distance, at the time we first saw it.  at that time; i thought “man that jet is flying low”!  in a few seconds i noticed it wasn’t moving and it had no wings!  object also looked too long for its diameter.  in other words; it looked like a 747 without its wings!  it was also very, “vivid” and had what looked like an aura surrounding it.  it was like looking at something in the desert with all the heat waves.  but the heat waves were not obstructing the view of the object, they were surrounding it.  the skies were really blue that morning and again, not even a wisp of a cloud.  i really don’t know how else to explain it.  it was like it jumped out at you; like watching a 3d movie.  anyway, we watched this thing for a few more seconds as we headed toward it.  neither one of us are saying anything about what each is looking at.  i haven’t said anything because i’m still not sure what i’m looking at.  later, i asked my nephew why he didn’t say something sooner and replied; he also wasn’t sure what he was looking at until we had reached the bridge.  as we approached the bridge, it couldn’t have been more than 400 yards away when i realized, for sure, that this wasn’t an airplane or any other object i could identify.  as we were crossing the bridge it became hidden behind the trees.  before i could say anything, my nephew said; “what is that”?  i said; “i don’t know but were fixing to find out”.   when we got to the other side of bridge and beyond the obstruction of the trees, it was gone.  it was out of our sight and behind the trees for less than five seconds!  we could see in every other direction for miles and it was gone!  just on the south side of bridge and right below where this thing had been hovering was an air conditioning contracting crew working outside at a house.  so we pulled in the driveway and asked if they had saw or heard an airplane crash or land nearby, about 20 seconds ago.  they replied that they hadn’t seen or heard anything but said; “we weren’t looking up”.  so, i and my nephew got back into our vehicle and continued toward our destination.  being perplexed about what we had just seen and experienced, we started talking about it.  after talking, we had both saw and experienced the exact same thing!  now, this is strange!  nothing, we know about, could have got out of sight that quick.  its shortest path to get out of our site was more than two miles away.  i know this because i gps’d it.  it would have had to gone over two miles then jump over some trees!  that would put it travelling well over 1000 mph to make that distance in that amount of time.  i’ve never heard of a blimp, closest identifiable thing it resembled, going that fast.  we even talked about how this thing might have cloaked itself.  i say this because, as i mentioned earlier, it didn’t look right.  my nephew also concurred.  the object was too vivid and around it was blurred.  i called it an aura earlier so you would get the idea.  thirty five years ago i see something, don’t tell anyone and never see anything else even suspicious.  tell someone, (you guys), and within a couple of months see another, “identical”, thing!  what are the odds?  i also wouldn’t be saying anything about this, but again, there were others, my nephew, who saw the “exact” same thing i did.  so, i’m pretty confident we couldn’t both be delusional at the “exact” same time.  what would be the odds?  and, this is not lights in the sky!  this is 9:30 a.M. in the morning without a hint of a cloud in the sky!  in other words; there is no doubt in what you saw!  you just don’t know what it is!  you know; the first time i saw this exact same thing 35 years ago, i really didn’t give it much consideration.  i was just a teen ager at the time and i think i might have questioned myself about what we had seen.  but now, i have a lot more of life to reflect back on.  i am a scada engineer, have patents on “elf” devices, and outdoorsman my entire life, etc...  my dad was also an inventor and patent holder of the “electronic, current sensing, motor protector”, (1973).    so, i have been around cutting edge technology my entire life and this makes “no sense”! i know what’s real and what’s not.  i know what’s possible and what’s not.  this shouldn’t be possible unless there is something i and evidentially most people don’t know about!  it’s driving me crazy!  thought i had a good handle on things.  evidently not!  if there is anything you can tell me, i’d appreciate it.  thanks for listening.\r\n","distance":"101-500

of the craft yet i am inclined to believe that it was relatively close and relatively small due to the sounds i heard. i assume that if the craft were far away i would not have been able to hear it.\r\n the light was bright green, not a lighter shade of green, normal green but the light emitting from the craft was very bright. could not make out a shape or anything really other than the light itself. it was like how headlights from a car keep you from being able to see the license plate. \r\n i heard the noise before i saw the light, it sounded like thousands of crickets making their chirping sound at the rate of a machine gun, and the sound was coming from above me and off into the treeline about 2 blocks away. i looked up when i heard the buzzing/humming/rapid-fire chirping accelerating and that is when i noticed the light getting closer to me. a few seconds after i noticed it it seemed to back away a little bit and heat toward the east, though not very far, it almost immediately changed direction and moved to my right (west). on the first night (july 11th) i was too afraid to watch it, this was at around 1:20 am when i had to let my dog out to pee. the second night however i noticed the craft on my way home from walking the dog around the block at around 9:15. i caught the second event on video nd posted it to youtube, though the quality is terrible because i had the dog pulling my arm out of the socket the whole time.\r\n the second nit i witnessed the craft do much of the same maneuvers as the first night, though for about 2 full minutes. my fear had worn off. at one point the craft decent rapidly, as though crashing, and as it fell the light changed from green to white, to this pinkish purple color. i thought it was gone and then i heard the sound of what i assume was some sort of engine (the buzzing/humming/rapid fire chirping) accelerating again. it came back up above the treeline again, this time never getting quite as high as it did before. i saw it hover over the treeline, moving to the south west, then seemingly changing it's mind and going north. it moved faster the second night, fast than any man made aircraft i've ever seen. i live close to uk airport in philly too so the plane always take off and descend right over my head so i know the speed and color of planes coming in and going out, helicopters as well. \r\n this object displayed no familiar behavior of any aircraft i have ever seen. the noise was like nothing i've ever heard. i wish more people got to witness the event with me, i might not have been so afraid that i was going to be abducted.
