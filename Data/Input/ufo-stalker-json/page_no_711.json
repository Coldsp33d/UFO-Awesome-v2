observed a large silvery white oval falling or rapidly descending from maybe 500-1,000 ft in the sky (slightly hazy blue) toward the ground.  the ground/horizon however is not actually in my line of sight (obscured by buildings).  the flash or reflection is what caught my eye in the first place before it fell or descended.  the \"oval\" was falling/shooting straight down with a short end being (up and down) while the long sides of the oval were (east/west).  i have never witnessed anything like this before and thought perhaps a wing had fallen off of a plane or a weather balloon was falling from the sky - but these dont seem plausible.  its a windy (10-14mph) day with shifts from onshore to southerly to even northwesterly. the object fell/shot straight down as though it had weight/mass.  before the event, i witnessed a white \"learjet\" type aircraft flying to the west of me about 15-20 minutes and about 15 minutes after the event i noticed another white \"learjet\" type airplane flying in the northwest, from perhaps the eugene airport (10 miles away).  when i observed the \"oval\" it was falling from what appeared to be 3-5 miles from my location.  no aircraft (plane or helicopter) were within sight when the \"oval\" flashed and fell/descended.  i have not heard sirens, seen smoke/fire or anything that would make this sighting an emergency situation. the \"oval\" flashed silvery white but was only white when it fell/descended.  this is the only sighting i have witnessed since i was 12 yrs old in 1962 and i witnessed a satin black, silently, low flying rectangular craft over my families back yard in late spring before sundown.","distance":"Over One

line tower) no red or green lights so i thought it must be a new type of helicopter, so i watched it the light popped every few seconds and i notice it's moving way to slow to be a plane but it was on a slow path towards me, this night had a full moon and was pretty clear out so i stooped a bit to make the light pass in front of the moon, noticed it had no airplane or helicopter sound and then just as it was about to be right in the moons light right over me 3 multi colored lights came into view. these colors were nothing like i'm used to viewing colors(i paint cars for a living) each of the 3 lights changed it colors slowly then once it was full in the moon it had a perfect outline and noticed the strobe light was no longer visible only the 3 round lights which nearly covered all of the under surface and as it got about the same angle as when i notice the 3 lights vs the 1 strobe the strobe reappeared just under the machine aprox. 6 feet under it, not touching or connected to anything leaving me to think the 3 lights were making the strobe. there was a funny feeling in my body as it passed over me that went away as soon as i no longer could see 3 lights but just the 1 strobe it was a perfect concaved triangle with a dome on the top. i built machines the ones that build cars, as an automation tech i know machines and that one was not of this earth. since that

it on the night setting, got out of my car and took two pictures. i checked the preview to make sure the camera captured it because it was so dark and there's barely any lights in the area. i started looking around the sky and was shocked to see a huge dark shape in the clouds, high above my car. the spiral was to the left of my car and the shape was pointing in that direction and directly above me. i kept thinking maybe it's just a break in the clouds and all i'm seeing is the night sky. but the fact that it had visible straight lines and what appeared to be, a sharp point, made me want to take several more pictures. it was not moving at all. there was absolutely no sound or lights. i don't know how low the clouds were but the object seemed huge. i don't know anything about cloud altitude so it's hard to make an accurate guess of how high or big it was. i want to say the width appeared to be as wide as maybe 5 passenger jets side by side. i observed it for about 6 minutes

this aircraft cross the sky in a very very unreal way. the way that it moved was not like anything i had ever seen. it was not decending as if it was thrown out of an aircraft or dropped. it was flying top over bottom, flipping end over end while in flight. it was like nothing i had ever seen before. how can something fly in a straight line across the sky if it is turning and flipping end over end? there was no obvious sign of propulsion. no obvious sign of any type of engine and no engine noise. i seen this amazing sighting for about 2 minutes until it was no longer in sight. me and

back it was gone?? i thought to myself, what the heck? i got on my cell phone and called my buddy i was with and asked him if he had seen what i seen? he said he did see it. this guy i hunt with is a huge skeptic on everything! i told him i would meet him at the gate and we would head back home from there. while i was walking to my 4 wheeler from my tree stand (approx 1/2 mile) i seen red ball looking lights in the sky again. i stopped and watched them for a second or 2 and they would kinda like giro?? meaning they would be in a circle maybe 9 or 10 and they would multiply and the circle would get huge. i met up with my buddy and asked him if he seen it again and he said no. i told him what i seen while walking to my 4 wheeler and he laughed at me and said he seen bigfoot sarcasticly! i was kind mad that he didnt believe me. so we both were on 4 wheelers headed across a picked corn field headed home. i was in the lead when the lights appeared again. i stopped my 4 wheeler and my buddy pulled up beside me and he seen them too. then he didnt know what to think. he tried to say it was a plane. i know better. like i said he is a huge skeptic. anyway we both watched the lights for approx 10 minutes and all at once they were gone. funny thing is while we were both watching these lights they would form huge circles and then one of the red balls would drop straight down then 4 or 5 more would come off of that one. then they would all come back to each ball the form a huge ball again. they would pulsate then stay solid. it is the strangest thing i ever seen. finally the just vanished and that was it. while i was watching this i was in total awwe. i was just mystified at what i was seeing. the whole time i was thinking to myself, ( i knew they were real)!","distance":"Over

and drove back to my friends home. the vehicle ran perfectly by the time i was back.The minister said he prayed that i would come back. he needed to pray for deliverance for me.\r\nwent thru the deliverance that night. nothing changed in me.\r\ni spent the following night at my friends home. \r\nwoke that morning to her yelling frantically for me. she was clearly shaken. took me upstairs to her bed room. her husband had already left for work early am. \r\nshe turned on the light and showed me the room. there was blood all over the bed, headboard, carpet, pillow. only on her side of the bed. she was done with her menstrual cycle and well into menopause when this happened. there went any blood on her- she undressed infant of me. . and asked me to tell her if she has blood or marks on her. she was so scared! at the point when i saw the blood a memory flagged thru my mind. i could see what happened. \r\nwe called the minister and he told us what to pray. then we cleaned the blood out of everything. it took us half the day. my friend told me to not tell her husband. she was afraid of him knowing.\r\n\r\nas for what happened: my memory is of two tall beings bringing me into her bedroom. they were going to teach me how they do what they do. but it was to be a lesson for me and a warning.  first they put a watery gel on my arms up past the elbows and had me pass my hands thru my body then the wall. then they made me touch my friend. then they opened her up- like filleting a fish or an autopsy. i could see every bone nerve vessels. then at one point i was told to do something and refused. it was a moral decision on my part. ethical as well. when i refused to do as told i was shoved back and told to watch. then told. humans need a lot of training to control their fears and emotions.\r\nthe people my friend told writing text horrified and i was asked to leave her home. i planned on leaving any how because i didn't want anyone else to be hurt.R","distance":"20

at some points the object would go up and go down lower to the mountain. around 5 minutes after us watching it in awe 6 or so jets come from what it looks like kirtland air force base. all of them kind of side by side speeding right above our heads, low. as they get closer to the object out at the mountain behind our home they all somehow circle the object as if trying to capture it. more jets seem to appear to circle the object hovering over the mountain. it looked as if the object was getting something from that spot in the mountain. while one weird government looking plane with shining red and blue lights as if it was a cop car slowly goes down toward the light at a slow speed the object floats up a little, and just disappears! once this happens all the aircraft's zip at high speeds as if they were searching the sky for the object. they stayed flying in the air around the area till we all went to bed the night it happened. sometimes hearing the roar of the aircraft's echo off the mountain sides loud. a family friend of ours works at a gas station named phillips 66 in the town of grants, new mexico. just 5 miles away from our little village. we strike up a conversation about what had happened that night and he says a few people had actually jumped off the highway to ask if there were military planes shooting down a object. but from watching it at our house they never did get close enough to the hovering object. still to this day there is many aircraft's flying over from what seems to be kirtland air force base over to the same spot seeming to be searching for something. some days jets flying over in numbers back and forth. lately seeing them hovering in the same spot surrounded by a few other hovering government planes as if keeping watch. past two nights they have been in the same spot where the object was the day of the incident while others hover around the sky in the area. while in the area a red, fast, low, blinking plane like object flys over the

if there were any fireflies that night. i saw maybe two in the cedar trees, certainly nothing like the spring of that year when there were thousands of them that appeared every night for almost a week.. what a delightful and awesome sight to see all those fireflies coming out like that. the county agent said that there were several swarms of fireflies during the same time in several locations around town and the county. my dad was city manager at the time and knew all the county officials. \r\non this particular night, when nothing seemed to be happening and the small town was getting sleepy, i strolled through our yard looking at the stars (which was something i always loved to do when i was younger). i had thought of getting my telescope out that i had got for the previous christmas but it was too late and just settled for looking at the stars.  after several minutes, i noticed a string of multi-colored lights moving from the nw towards my location. when they got directly overhead, they stopped. they moved out of position and began to wander as if they were looking for something. they went back and forth and just wandered over the area for several minutes. i had gone inside to tell my dad knowing he would be interested in this since he's the city manager. he came out immediately and my mother came too to see \"these strange lights that were wandering around the sky\". my mother exclaimed, 'oh my gosh, what is that?' and my dad replied, 'i have no idea dear, i don't know what this or these things are'.  at that time, several of our neighbors had also come out to witness the colored lights. after about 15 minutes of wandering around in the sky right over us, they suddenly came together very slowly and formed a tight circle and hovered there in place. after less than a minute, a bright white object came towards the circle of glowing orbs and it also came from the nw. as it approached the circle, they slightly parted as if to let the white light in, and there it came to a stop in the middle of the circle of multi-colored lights. slowly, the colored light circle began to turn as if in a carnival ride. now this was getting frightening. after about 15 seconds of the circle turning, the colored lights began to peel off of the circle.  i believe the first one to leave the circle was a blue one. as it broke the circle, it headed to the sw and the rest of the colored lights also peeled off and followed the first one in a straight line. after they had traveled slowly towards the sw for 15 seconds, the bright white light left behind also joined the line as the line headed straight sw. we all watched until the lights were out of eyesight. i unknowingly had walked backwards down our street about a half block before i had realized where i was. the neighbors all congregated in our yard and discussed the incident. my dad assured them he would check it out and let them all know something. he never heard a word from anyone he contacted and that was the end of the ordeal unfortunately.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then
