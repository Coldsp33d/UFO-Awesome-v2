now this place i had first visited about 10 to 12 years ago and have revisited it several times over the years. it’s a pretty interesting area with a lot of petrified wood every place you look. this particular area we were looking in, i had found some petrified wood, and it was kind of strange, to me and had an appearance of being worked by forces other than nature. since that time i always had been compelled to return to the area, i always felt that there was something more to find, something even out of the ordinary. \r\n i checked on the geology of the area and found that the deposit are from best i could tell where laid down during the eocene epoch that lasted 56 to 33 million years ago. i also had a suspicion that petrified wood and uranium went hand in hand, which was confirmed by google. this whole area is known for its mining of that element.\r\n so back to sunday, we were finding a lot of petrified wood, and again some of it looked as if it was somehow worked. we were in a canyon with mesas on both sides and the strata the trees were deposited was obvious, it was a mud layer about mid-way up the mesa. the deposit above was harder than the mud layer, so it was decomposing faster and more complete. after walking down from the top of the mesa we headed down into the talus slope near the point it levels off. there was mud sediments all around, in pretty small pieces. it was then i notice something unusual just breaking the surface of the ground. it appeared circular, i picked it up and noticed that it in fact was round, perfectly round and was out of place. \r\n the object was not cut or cored or chiseled, as you can see in the third photo. it appears that when the mud was soft, there was something that made an impression then was filled in by the harder rock over time, then the softer mud rock eroded leaving this cast if you will. the impression is a perfect 6 inches in diameter, plus or minus one inch thick and has at least 4 or more striations making up the disk. the impression was made when the trees were still wood and not yet petrified. notice the same size dimples directly across from one another at its diameter. whatever made this impression was flat on the bottom. this rock, object or whatever you call it is definitely weird, and seems to have been made by something other than a natural occurrence. to me along with the wood that seemed to have been worked, it’s almost gives the feeling that this might have been made some machine or landing craft. what do you think? if it was an impression made by some natural force what could it have been? it’s not a dinosaur foot print since the dinosaurs had been gone some 10 million years before the eocene epoch.  \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

was under the disc directly looking up it was hovering as soon as it realized i could see them because you could not see this with the naked eye it bugged out at a high rate of speed, meaning it did not blink out it left so fast it was amazing.  the height of the disc i could not figure out but if you took a garbage can lid placed up on a tree about 35 feet this is the size of this object. this

midnight when a giant box shaped ufo came over our heads it was a full moon and you could see it was metallic with windows and light coming through i would say it was around 150 from tree top height so maybe 225 feet it made no sound not even wind it moved at a consistent pace not to fast or slow . i don't know if i have been abducted when i was younger i had sleep paralysis allot and a very odd

sister. 1975.   rural area. dusk outside...Evening was just beginning around 8pm.   brother came rushing into home shouting about a ufo outside.  we hesitated thinking he was pulling our leg for about 3 minutes.  then, we ran outside and across the street to an empty field where we saw it....  we began jumping and shouting below it.  it hovered with no noise just about 5 foot above a telephone pole. you could sense a mass above you - this was not projection of any kind.   it was about 3000 square foot round and the underside had white lights that went around in sequence.  it looked just like the old game simon from that time period, but with more lights.  it was round just like your cliche saucer, but it was thicker than i had heard in stories.  it was just thick/tall enough that a man would have about 5 to 10 inches headroom if he was standing up.  i could not see the surface since it was dark outside, the object was above me, and the lights obscured any view of the object except a solid, dark outline.  it hovered for about a minute, and we jumped and carried on under it the whole time.  then, it turned south and within about two seconds, it went from 3000 sq foot to a pin head with no sound.  i did hear the faint sound of wind slice, but no propellers, no jets, no flame, no cloud, nothing!!  at the time, i didn't realize how important what i saw was and it was just stored into my memory for years.  i talked to my sister in our thirties and she remembered it too and continually says to me, \"what was that we saw?\"  none of us had active imaginations, and this was definitely no figment of our imaginations.  we had a very normal childhood with no drama, etc... just a regular family life.  i have grown to believe most persons speaking on ufo's and those

7/15/2015\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nin 1957 my grandfather and i were picking plums in a field when we heard a rumbling, roaring sound. we looked up and saw a craft coming towards us. when they saw us they slowed down and stared at us through a large window, we stared back in awe.\r\nthe craft was plexi glass like material on the top and shiny, weathered, chrome like on the bottom. it was as large as a cessna and it was saucer shaped. it had a large window with three humanoids looking out at us. two had blond hair and really blue eyes, one was male with a blue uniform with a strip coming down from his shoulder to his waist, and the female had wavy blond hair, another female had a  pony tail colored brown. they resembled vikings in features. we could see other beings wearing dark robes in the background bent over a table. the craft made no noise, but we did hear a rumbling in the background, but it wasn't coming from the craft, the craft was silent. when it went over us it was about tree top or 150 feet high, and about 200 yards from us. as it passed over us at about 25 mph,the very bottom was black. it was traveling from west to east and had no lights on.\r\nit sped up after passing us and we lost sight of it.\r\n\r\ni was 7 years old and asked my grandfather, who was 58 years old at the time, what was that? he said in spanish \"avionics from another world\"\r\nmy grandfather rode with pancho villa and didn't seem surprised to see the ufo. \r\nthe humanoids seemed almost friendly, and we felt no ill effects from seeing them.\r\nthen the roaring increased after they were gone, and two us korean war jets passed by chasing them.\r\nwe never talked about it again, like our little secret. \r\ni saw a

10:30pm. i was talking to a few buddies in the parking lot for a while and happened to look up between our two buildings and asked \"is that the little dipper? it seems a little bright.\" one of my friends responded, \"yeah, it's just the little dipper.\" i noticed the three lights were moving very slow, and then one of my friends confirmed that they also noticed the lights moving slowly and then into a straight line. they kind of laughed it off and left shortly after. i stayed to photograph the objects.\r\n\r\ni continued to watch the lights move slowly across the sky in perfect precise movements. their distance from each other remained the same. the lights never blinked or pulsated- it was a constant light being emitted. i kept thinking they could just be military planes or aircraft being tested, but i noticed several aircraft fly by (under these objects as far as altitude is concerned) and these objects seemed to be much larger and brighter than the tiny blinking lights of the aircraft (most likely commercial airliners do the proximity of an international airport/airforce base). \r\n\r\nas i continued to watch the objects, the middle light started to rise and would eventually form a triangle. at this moment, i noticed a fourth light of equal brightness. as the lights remained in this position for about 5 minutes, they started to get back into their straight line formation. it was at this point that i decided to call my wife. i told her of the event and she seemed interested but kind of wanted to see my pictures to believe it. i got into my car and made my commute home (west) but i could still see the objects to my left as i drove westbound on interstate 26. eventually these lights faded into the night sky as they became further and further apart from each other.\r\n\r\ni submitted the pictures to an online forum and someone enhanced them for me, and i was absolutley baffled by what i saw- they almost appeared as spheres.\r\n\r\ni tried to take some video, but the quality was not worth sharing. i really hope there is an explanation for this event.","distance":"Over One

in brooklyn. ny. the sky was clear with only a few little clouds north east.\r\nit was around four thirty am, we were chatting and i turned my head around to the west, i saw what i thought it was a star first. inside me i felt something was off. didn't realizing what was wrong yet, i thought to pull up my iphone app that maps the night sky and can tell the name off stars and constellations. because i thought it could be the north star but i don't know, something was weird, i couldn't see any other stars near by because luminescent pollution, plus that thing was bigger than the north star, in the wrong place and its light wasn't withe, was clearly yellow/orange. as all this thoughts are happening at once, one of our girlfriends decides to leave, so i take my eyes off the light, to say good night to my friend, it probably took three minutes or even less, when i decided to look back to the light on the west to use the app. \r\nto my surprise that thing had descend is moving and is about to pass right over us, still looks the same but is bigger now.\r\nat this point i know is not a star because is moving so i tell my friends to look at it, we all look at it, i suggest it might be a satellite. but i had seen satellites before sailing at night in the sea, that couldn't be a satellite, conditions in brooklyn are never right to star gaze and it was to big and flying too low and too slow. my feeling was that thing descend first in an approximate forty-five degree angle towards us and now it's on straight flight path north east...\r\nwe kept tracking the light and then, it brooke the flight path moving south east, then two seconds later back to north east, next second straight down, it dimmed disappeared, then about three seconds later reappeared, moved upwards and then ascended again in an forty something degree angle like it was gonna leave the atmosphere, until it faded away.\r\n\r\nwe were astounded by it, one of my friends said he first thought i was star before we noticed it was moving. all this took about eight minutes but that light had to be visible to us at least twenty to twenty five minutes since it first appeared in the sky. right before and after we could see commercial airplanes flying by much higher, we could totally contrast  those with the light we had just seen, meaning it was not an airplane, it made no noise and it wasn't flying fast, it kind of floated, always moving straight lines even when changing directions. it had no signaling lights like airplanes, it was just a big bright yellow dot passing by with no flickering, no way it could be an air ballon either or an elicopter.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

still leaves a lasting memory happened in aug 09.My daughter had a sighting of this orb glowing white it was big as 2 school buses belly to belly. we watched as it came down the street and stopped in the backyard and hovered there for a few seconds.A door in this storm or what i would call a very large ship  was cloaked , opened and the orb went into and the door closed.At the same time this storm was pulsating blue, red and white colors same place everytime.This was the second time i had seen this orb.But the first i had seen this cloaked ship.There was no dought in my mind this was aufo it sat for a few min.Approximatley 10 min.It then took off just as the morning sun was rising.I never saw it go cause it was so fast but, i watched the clouds going in the opposite direction were doing a million miles an hr.The sun came up and no storm and a beautiful day.As i said i saw some other sightings, a friend and i were looking at the stars when a brite white light came flyihg into sight stopped for a second then in a flash gone.I have also seen large ships in the sky over town which could be seen reflecting in the water , the stars didn't reflect but these did.A buddy and myself were in the town park one night.I asked him if he had noticed any ufo sightings and just as i had said this a small cigar shaped one flew by and down the shoreline.I thought wow this place is crazy.As i said before about the white orb, i was at my relatives and my uncle and auntie also saw this orb come across there farm land.My aunt missed getting a picture by seconds.I think i put new thoughts in my relatives as my uncle thought it was a astronaut coming down.I thought sure here in the boonies thats gonna appen and plus there were no reports of any kind the next day on tv.I could go on but i
