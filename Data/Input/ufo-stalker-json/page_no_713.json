aug 2009.I am just going to report straight of the top of my head as i did before.In killarney manitoba , i was witness to many sightings, some with witnesses.The one that i can remember best and still leaves a lasting memory happened in aug 09.My daughter had a sighting of this orb glowing white it was big as 2 school buses belly to belly. we watched as it came down the street and stopped in the backyard and hovered there for a few seconds.A door in this storm or what i would call a very large ship  was cloaked , opened and the orb went into and the door closed.At the same time this storm was pulsating blue, red and white colors same place everytime.This was the second time i had seen this orb.But the first i had seen this cloaked ship.There was no dought in my mind this was aufo it sat for a few min.Approximatley 10 min.It then took off just as the morning sun was rising.I never saw it go cause it was so fast but, i watched the clouds going in the opposite direction were doing a million miles an hr.The sun came up and no storm and a beautiful day.As i said i saw some other sightings, a friend and i were looking at the stars when a brite white light came flyihg into sight stopped for a second then in a flash gone.I have also seen large ships in the sky over town which could be seen reflecting in the water , the stars didn't reflect but these did.A buddy and myself were in the town park one night.I asked him if he had noticed any ufo sightings and just as i had said this a small cigar shaped one flew by and down the shoreline.I thought wow this place is crazy.As i said before about the white orb, i was at my relatives and my uncle and auntie also saw this orb come across there farm land.My aunt missed getting a picture by seconds.I think i put new thoughts in my relatives as my uncle thought it was a astronaut coming down.I thought sure here in the boonies thats gonna appen and plus there were no reports of any kind the next day on tv.I could go on but i think this is good for now.Do i believe yes sir no dought we are not alone!I make this report on my life that it had happened!","distance":"21-100

being observed yet i didn't see any predatory animals yet i still sensed i was being watched i continued to train i took a momentarily pause and i was surveying my surrounding areas when i happened to glance up towards a bird in flight and it was during that moment in time when i saw i was being observed by a aircraft silently hovering a silently moving towards me i approached the aircraft and i got as close to the aircraft as i possibly could get if i were to climb the limb of the tree nearest to me i could've jumped aboard the aircraft which i thought about doing to bring it down.As i stood at the ready to attack if provoked by the aircraft if need be.\r\ni didn't know what this strange and foreign aircraft was i will say the aircraft had three sections and really tiny wheels and i thought to myself how are those tiny wheels going to support the weight of that aircraft it was neat looking and i was impressed with what i saw. as we observed each in a respectful way i was less then ten feet from the aircraft at this time period my curiosity brought me closer and i was thinking if it were to attack me how could i dismember the components of the aircraft to bring it down incase a battle were to happen i saw weaknesses in the aircraft which i planned to inflict upon the aircraft incase something were to happen upon greeting this aircraft which to this day i haven't seen an aircraft with the same structure as this one in appearance and shape. i did happen to take photos of the aircraft but my phone got water lodged and damaged before i could produce any photos of the aircraft.\r\ni still have the memory though.\r\nas for my feeling i wasnt frightened or afraid i was curious to come in contact with the aircraft and i feel that the operator driving the aircraft didn't expect to come across anyone during its maid voyage i'd move it'd follow i'd stop and it'd hover and wait till i made movement again then continue to follow and i found that to be weird yet exciting.\r\ni went under foilage and was preparing to board the hovering aircraft as it inched closer to me.\r\nafter i went under the treetops the aircraft turned 180 degrees and did another 180 degrees as if it were searching for me at that point it began to slowly ascend higher above the treetops as it continued upon its path i stepped out of the shadows and it momentarily stoped and began to head back towards me and then it stopped as it did i bid it farewell and it took off at a high rate of speed and continued to gain altitude before it was no longer in my eye view.\r\nand that was the last i ever seen of this aircraft.\r\nafterwards after this strange encounter i kept this to myself for four years until i learned of mufons existence which is why iam contacting you now your the first to hear my altercation with this aircraft.\r\nto see if maybe someone else may have seen what i saw on that day.\r\nwhen the time comes i will draw a sketch of the aircraft.\r\n","distance":"20

kids and myself were playing hide n seek. i was attempting to hide 3doors up from home, in the alley way that separates the homes by 2s, as i was approaching the gate to open it, 2 dark, approx. 5-6\",long lanky arms, torso and legs and upsided triangle shaped heads and huge fly shaped eyes, appeared from around the back of the home. i was frozen with fear when one of the aliens raised a arm showing three fingers with bulbous type tips, i ran home jump in my bed under the covers. my mom came to check on me and i told her what i saw and laughed and said i couldn't have seen what i described.\r\n\r\nfor 3 straight days from the initial sightings, when i would go to bed i would be awaken by what i called \"the little green men\" and they would be 4 on each hand with what i thought was dental floss, 2on a finger cutting my fingers leaving paper cut cuts on each digit of my fingers. the other odd thing was i couldn't scream or move while this was happening and afterwards i immediately went to sleep. i would tell my mom and siblings and they would laugh and say i was dreaming and scratching myself.\r\n\r\ni knew what i saw and experienced was truly happening but no one believed me so i just didn't share my story until in the 90's and more and more people were seeing the two aliens that greeted me but no one ever made mention of \"the little green men\"\r\n\r\ni said all of this to say thank you netflix for airing \"sirius\" for in this documentary there \"it\" was one of the \"the little green men\" just as i remembered. thank you all for proving to all of whom i

just like we do every year. a few minutes after it started some of the stars stared to look like they were moving, but i ignored it thinking it was just my imagination. then, a few minutes after that i noticed two lights in the north east that started flashing green and red but they were stopped in mid air. i kept watching them as they came from a hovering position to darting across the sky and then stopping at another point. i poked my friend sitting next to me and showed him these two lights, at first he didn't look but then we started to notice that not too many people were watching the fireworks anymore, but instead these dancing green and red lights. they seemed almost as if they were interested in the explosions but when the show ended they both turned yellow and took off to the south east. after it was over i asked someone who worked for the air force that was sitting next to me watching the if he knew of any aircraft that could do that and his answer appeared to be no. as we left i saw about five helicopters hovering around on the opposite side of the show as the ufos.","distance":"Over One

constellation ursa major which was in the north west, i saw this object (orb) of light appear to the left of it out of nowhere. the object (orb) appeared very dimly then got brighter and pulsated for a short period of time, then got very dim and disappeared. i went back inside and told my mom what i saw and she joined me outside, and i pointed to her the direction that i saw the object (orb). and at that time we both witnessed the object (orb) come from above the tree line like it appeared to be hovering there, and it started to raise toward the handle of ursa major. as is was raising it would get bright and pulsate then got dim and disappeared and this happened twice, both times it started at the tree line and raising to the handle of ursa major. the first sighting by myself lasted no more then 10 seconds, but no shorter then 5 seconds and was north west to my home. the second sighting where my mom and i both witnessed lasted about 5 to 7 seconds. then the third sighting happened about 15 minutes after the first too, and this time it was south west to where my home stands. the object appeared to the right of the constellation scorpius, just like the other two sightings the object (orb) behaved the same way. it appeared to be hovering right at the tree line and went right to left and disappeared in a flash of light. it got brighter then the planet saturn which was very visible the night this happened, the flash was blue in the center and white as it faded out (like a flash from a camera). the time of the first sighting was about 9:30 pm, the second sightings was about 9:35, and the last sighting where the object (orb) disappeared in the flash was 9:45.

bright light above the road, thought it was odd since it was still light out. initially thought it had to be a planet or very bright star to be so prominent in the daylight. as i came around a curve in the road i noticed a second dimmer orb. slowed to approximately 5 mph. the second orb slowly began to increase in brightness until it was brighter than the first. both lights began slowly pulsing. the second orb, which was to the right of the first but on the same elevation began to move from my west to north. the second light followed. at this point i stopped my vehicle, rolled down window and turned off radio, no noise at all was noticed. orbs were slowly moving at a constant speed. no change in color occurred. after about 5 minutes the lights began to dim at exactly the same time until they flashed and disappeared. no objects were seen after lights vanished, it was still daylight. at first thought it was a chinese lantern due to their frequent releases in this area but i have never witnessed one pulsate or vanish in such a manner. no secondary lights of other colors were observed so i discounted airplanes and they appeared far to close for planes.","distance":"Over One
