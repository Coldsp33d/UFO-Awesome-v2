had also seen it.It was around 2:00 am and 3:30 am approx. but it only lasted around 20 minutes before flying away,to be honest i didnt see it fly, it was too fast.,almost like if you turn off the light very fast.,im not sure how far it was, but i know it was no plane or nothing i have ever seen before,it  what ever it was it knew we seen it, it was rotating sort of like playing a game ,then at times it would stop rotating but it had a constant red glow.I didnt have any camera at that time.I told my friend that was next to me \"are you seen what im seeing\", he replyed of course its a witch, that's what some people in mexico call ufo's, according to him. the naval base was located north west of were i was fishing and behind me i beleive was a water treatment plant or some type of plant,to

home, we were passing by holy cross hospital and alamany high school when i noticed a big bright flash across the horizon, and behind the hillside.  i remember it seemed large to me.  it was quick, my brother, sisters, or mother didn't say anything.  i felt strange that i was the only one that noticed it.  i looked around and didn't see a trailer or more so i left it at that. **about 4 to 6 months later, summertime,about mid day my older sister and i are in hawaii visiting family and my mom, aunt, younger sister and brother saw a ufo.  my mother and aunt are no longer with us, but my brother and sister are still around.  this is what they all told us when we came home from hawaii.  we are still living in the same house which is only a few miles from my event, my mother was in the shower and my aunt, brother, and sister hear a strange sound.  it sounded like it is coming from above the house.  they go out the front door and see a round object in the sky above the house just hovering there.  my aunt goes in the house hollering at my mom to hurry and come see, something was outside.  my mother said julie sounded so urgent and odd that she hurried and got dressed and went out front.  startled, she said she just stood there and stared.  the object began to move very slowly.  my mother said she didn't know what she was thinking but grabbed the keys to the car and they all hopped in and followed the craft.  it has been so long ago, and we moved to las vegas in 1965, i don't remember the name of the streets.  haskell i believe is one.  but the ufo dropped behind a hill, my mom drove up the hill.  on the other side of the hill is a reservoir and the water wasn't still...?  never saw anything else.  so long ago we have no pics or video.  it has always been there in my mind, i love watching the night sky looking for more,  i have spent a lot of time camping out in the desert and mountains of nevada looking.

,this i know because television signed off at 2400.My bed was placed at the base of a window .Once in a while i could see military plaines day or night.We lived six miles out of town and the nearest neighbor about one quater of a mile.There was a barbed wire fence about 100ft. from our house . this property was owned by the u s government.E.I.Dupont contracted to build a sister plant to oak ridge tenn.My   dad worked at this plant and later they had 17 reactors.Now you might not find them on the average map . it is a secret.If you knew all ,it would make area 51 look like nothing.As i laid in bed late one night i saw two flat ,round ,bright glowing craft that came in from the south about 300ft or about.( at the time i was a trained member of the ground observer coure ). the average height of trees inthis area was about 20 ft. the flight pattern was like a lead plain with a wing man .All at once they mede a sharp 90% turn to the west then a flash of light . gone in a flash with no noise at all.My dad worked rotateing shifts and days off. a few days after this ,i called my dad out side to talk ,house may have been wired.We did have a meeting with the men in black, and i almost shot them .Another time. i told my dad what i had seen and he couldn't tell me no. he said each time they change the loads in the reactors they come and hoover over the plant.Years later a family friend told me that they make the trianglar charge cells and exchange with the u>f>o>.This property is about 100 square miles maby more and has under ground protection of all types. now you might know that a fence does not stop teenagers.I once heard that a group of ufo watchers were located in aiken south carolina .Did you report on the sighting about 1990 that was as large as anair craft carrier modesto, stockton ione(two prisons) flew over seattle washington took a90%angle up ,a flash of light and out of sight.This story managed to make the 11 oclock news before the government shut it

a ginormous fireball just gliding in the air at first than really fast after a few minutes took a left turn started to descend towards us. after about 30 minutes went by it fell way back below the

when the video is color edited and slowed down. appearing to be standing on the side of a wormhole or some kind of an opening basically looking like gaurds or waiting for something. the one on the

Mirage","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I viewed this event in two brief moments over the stated timeline. both while standing in front of my home, facing north, 8-10 miles away from el mirage dry lake bed and looking over and behind the lake bed at the tops of the shadow mountains. the lights were at the very top,spread out left to right what for me was only and inch or so was maybe a mile or more at that distance and height. from my perspective, if the width of all appeared to be just an inch then their individual, round size would be 3/16\" average diameters. it's common to see lights on the slopes from camper, their ohv's and campfires but, those are smaller, more pinpoint, typically solitary or paired, spread out over great width from the various campsites and never, on top. simply non-accessible rocky terrain hundreds of feet up a steep slope, without trails. and having lived here for 18 years at this home i've never seen lights on top, ever. \r\n\r\nso the first siting was around 2am when i took the dog out. i noticed the lights immediately. even a bit groggy and confused i knew there were too many, in a straight line and too high up the slope. over the next few minutes i observed 3 to at max 8 or 9 lights glowing larger than normal with mostly clean white light. some faded out, others appeared. a couple never moved while the others gently moved horizontally. sometimes moving a little and stopping and staying. other times moving off and returning. from my great distance all changes seemed gentle and smooth - without purpose. their size all about the same until i noticed some faint blues. no more than two,somewhat smaller, maybe behind the others. the same for a single reddish/orange, to the right or the blues with empty space and a white or two in between. that's the only times i observed any depth to the scene. \r\n\r\nat 4am i had to leave and i wont my friend about 3:45 and again took the dog out. i was surprised to see them still there. i rushed my friend to come see and he agreed - different/out of place. we were talking and observing for about a minute and suddenly the single white light farthest west exploded brilliantly in size. instantly 5 or 6 times in diameter, just as bright with pure white light. huge, in inch in observable height to me but several hundred feet there. over the next few seconds it shrank a bit and faded out. when that happened 1/3 of its diameter was below and in front of the ridge line. watched a couple minutes more but no more flashes and had to leave. my last two thoughts as we left... are there others on the opposite slope above shadow mountain village? and, the colored ones remind me a little of marfa, tx.\r\n\r\nlast night, my friend had gone home and again around 2am i took the dog out a couple of times before the dawn. neither man or beast saw anything out of the norm. no lights on the ridge. i'm sure the dog will be happy to go out again so i'll keep looking. that flash was bigger than any light i've ever seen. i decided to report this observation via mufon after having found no mention of anyone else observing thru popular social media, news media and sheriff/fire logs. that's how i ended up writing this, i checked mufon logs (first time on their site) to see if someone else had observed and reported. no luck and so since my dog can't wright it feel on me. is there anybody out there?","distance":"Over One

is very common that we see planes directly after take off from the nearby buffalo/niagara international airport. we are only a few miles away. typically we see them take off from north west of or house and then go in whatever direction the destination is. we also see and hear other planes in the area flying much higher that do not appear to be landing or taking off from the nearby airport. \r\n\r\nthis appeared to be a plane that was just flying over and not taking off or landing. however, the color was not of any i had ever seen before and my wife agreed. \r\n\r\nit essentially appeared to take the steady standard path of a plane but looked like a fireball with no identifying features. it did not just appear to be a plane with colored lights on the wings or tails. this literally appeared to be a glowing ball of red-orange blur. hence the reference above to having fuzzy edges. not thinking much of it, i did not watch it for very long, only about 1 minute. the range of the time was between 9:38 and 9:52. exact time is unknown. that was the range of the call with my mother when i experienced the sighting. \r\n\r\nmy mother then strangely saw on the channel 4(cbs) local news a segment on a similar thing she heard me reference on the phone call and mentioned this was where they reported it. so she told me of the contact and here i am reporting it.

15-28. saw another one july 5th and since july 8th it is nightly again. have multiple pictures & videos. my field investigator has observed a couple as well. they are in our atmosphere, often below cloud line, not always. they're scattered throuout the valley. i've seen them to be around/at the northern mountain range as well. they are usually just hovering in place for hours, can appear & disappear, and change locations nightly. i've filmed them with the sun rising, all stars no longer visible, but they're strobing in the sky still. they have pulsing light patterns. to the eye they flash white, red, yellow, blue, green. from my pictures they seem to be an orb objects. on july 11th around 3 am i finally saw one move at stunning speed. it was the lowest i had seen one yet. it shot straight up, stopped, left/up, stop, up, stop, right/up, stop, up a lot, stop & disappear. i would describe it as incredibly speed, i mean fast!!! it also struck me as graceful & effortless. other times i think i've seen them slowly shift & then hold positions, but the morning of the 11th was awe inspiring. \r\n\r\nwhat i've observed. they are absolutely in our atmosphere. my mufon representative seems to agree. looking at pictures, they seem to be orbs that radiate patterned light. example: on photo burst every 5th/6th picture they disappear. the lights are sequential. they are bright! the farther away they are, the more star like appearance they take on. i've seen held triangle formations with the three points being the strobing lights, but i've never observed a body. i've also taken pictures on burst where one larger orb will split into 2 smaller orbs in the very next frame.\r\n\r\ni've had a very disappointing experience with mufon. to be clear my field investigator is trying to be helpful & has gone above and beyond. unfortunately all roads lead to the state director, who simply could not care less. we can't get video or pictures reviewed, we can't get follow up, we can't investigate, & doesn't even want the investigator coming over to observe without another person, but won't provide another person! and there's no way the state director will walk outside & look, let alone go to someone's house at 3 am. i had to teach my rep how to upload pictures onto mufon! there is no \"photo analysis\", no investigation, nothing. i would think mufon would be interested in an ongoing sighting & the ability to observe themselves, these objects. i am sending in video this time in the hopes that so how, some way, we can get around the state director. \r\n\r\ni am attaching video to this report. i have used all available space on the report, but i have a lot of video and still shots. a lot. if my field investigator & i are somehow able to get into contact with anyone who is actually interested and who is not the state director, feel free to contact me and i will forward you more. \r\n\r\nthank you!\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

(going from west to east always)almost every single clear night since march 12th of this year (as far as i have been aware at least). the craft i have seen have been black triangles (various light colors and patterns, which change when i try to reach out to them telepathically), orbs of light (blue ones and orange ones), which have dropped smaller orbs of orange light that went off in various directions and later returned to the hovering main orb, small metallic triangles with 4 white lights (2 craft following each other, touched and went in opposite direction), tube shaped craft with a white light on the back and a gold and blue pulsing power source on the bottom. please help! i'm worried with so many craft flying over every night between 9pm-10:30/11pm. if you come with some night vision cameras, i promise you will not be disappointed. i'm in over my head here. i don't have the technology to record my sightings well enough to see what it really is. i have been looking at them from directly underneath with military binoculars, but i need your help! my head is spinning with how much i have seen and i would like to have someone to help me sort through everything i've seen. my whole family and boyfriend have also witnessed these things and my boyfriend and i are very worried about this. the objects just show up on the west horizon, hover a bit, fly over the house and go east. the first time i saw them i was so afraid i couldn't breathe, then a \"blue star\" appeared and i suddenly felt very calm, and then all the other craft dispersed. i have drawings of all that i've seen (the photo i included is just from the internet, but its the same as my drawing). please help us figure this out...I would be very grateful and you won't be disappointed.
