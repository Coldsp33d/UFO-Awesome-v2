bright, not a reflection of the sun on an object as it was not moving at all. i can’t imagine that i am the only one who saw it, it was too bright not to be seen!P.S: it was spotted nne of my location at about 75% angle. to be frank, for the few first seconds, i though it was an airplane... but the brightness was too intense to be that. it was just hovering, no sound, no movement, and it got even brighter for a second or two. the edge was sort of white/yellow, oscillating. i though also for a moment that is was the reflection of the sun from a satellite, as the sun was going down at the same time. but it was so bright, fixed in the sky, for a good minute, then flew away until it disappeared. i took a picture with my cell phone, but can't see anything on the picture, probably too small for my phone.","distance":"Over One

getting close to 8 pm and was time for me to go home , so my friend said he would walk with me half way ,it was very nice out that night and was clear out in the sky , we were walking along the road and it was just starting to get darker outside , we got to a little opening in the road and trees i had my back turned at first and my friend was looking up in the sky , i was talking to him and he wasn't paying attention to what i was saying he was just looking up , he said to me \"hey man look at those stars don't they seem way closer than the others , i turned around and looked up at the three bright lights in the sky they had to of been only like 175-200 feet in the air , they were solid white lights that where glowing ,they only stayed in one spot for about 3 seconds than the bottom right light shot backwards and flew off into the sky , you could actually see it getting further and further away but at a really fast speed , the other 2 stars lined up with one another and started to move slowly together to the left , it was also crazy to see that where the 3 stars where sitting directly behind them was the 3 stars or orion's belt , almost like they where trying to hide infront of them so that maybe we wouldn't notice them , the 2 stars that started to move to the left started to get blocked off by the trees so my friend and me started to run up the road abit , the front light shot starlight up into the sky and disappeared the back star than started to fly up at a 45 degree angle and just kept going until we couldn't see it anymore . while this was happening my friend and me both felt that they where watching us , we where frozen in shock at first we both had tears pouring from our eyes but couldn't blink or look away when we ran up the road when they started to move it was like i didn't even know i was running i wasent even looking where i was running something just pulled us to run after it after they started to move away . me and him talked to each other about what we saw and agreed we seen the same thing and that it wasn't planes or anything like that , we both rushed back to my house and told my parents and my sister and her boyfriend , they all laughed at us and said it couldn't of happend , we have told other people and only some believe our story , since that day me and that same friend have seen unexplained things in the sky 2 more time together , and i've also seen something once with my girlfriend and once by myself all in the same general area . and always feel like i'm going to see something again .

old. my bedroom window over looked thousands of trees that surrounded our home that was located in a country neighborhood. i did this almost every evening before bed. my eyes were up at the stars then i caught a site out of the corner of my eye. when i saw this the giant ship hovering silently which seemed just a few feet away from our house i froze unable to take my eye's away. it was not a smooth surface or anything like the silver pictures most see on tv or in tabloids. it was of a copper/brown tone with things poking upward from the top and round and somewhat flat. i could not see the bottom as it was hovering just a few feet over the tree's that i looked down onto from our hill. it was like we were starring at each other face to face. it began flashing lights in a calming and beautiful pattern. i did not hear a single thing with my ears, but in my mind i heard a tone with the lights. a song. and not sure if this was a smart or stupid thing i did next, but out of reflex i wanted my brothers and parents to see this amazing thing. i turned my head and screamed, \"mom, a spaceship!!!\" i turned back to look at it again, this time it was drifting away (still close to tree tops). i heard the stomping feet of my excited little brother racing to see and turned saying, \"hurry!\". when i turned back it flew extremely fast at an up and over angle in the southwest direction then disappeared right as my family all came rushing in at once. everyone was excited, but sadly no one else saw this event. they all groaned and turned out mumbling things. i still remember the details, however, after about 10 years the song faded from memory. there was a repeated pattern of lights with a hum of calming tones that i wish i could still remember. spiritually, i am touched because that was my time of night where i prayed to be free from that small town, to travel, to explore. what better visit then from another planet.

white balls of light, seemed to be at various altitudes.Across the sky which seemed to spread out for unknown amount of miles.Upon first seeing these lights i was in complete shock.There were no stars out to be seen just these objects.Honestly at first i got nervous ,due to the amount of lights in the sky.As i stated they were all balls of light it seemed to me like the blue and green lights were gathering up all the white lights ,almost like a herd.During that time witnessed other blue and white lights ,coming from numerous directions in which i can only describe as lagging behind the other lights .But they were making up their distances ,by reaching incredible speed. i noticed only 2 balls of light .One was blue the other white make 90 degree direction changes.They were all heading nw, towards the sea.As i stated before when first witnessed , i was in shock .But it almost looked something from the movie close encounters ,because of the amount of lights in the sky and the different directions they were coming from.Once we lost sight of the lights heading nw .I stood outside looking up at the sky to 1am, and i did not notice one light or star in the night sky.I was so caught up

 it was a silver/iridescent/shimmering color.  rainbow/iridescent lights were all around it's bottom round edge.  my mother pulled the car off to the side of the road. she asked me to reach into the back seat of the car,  and get my camera out of my luggage to take a photo of it.\r\n\r\nit was like they heard her ask me this.  the minute i began the motion of turning around, the silver disc went from hovering, above the road to, in the blink of an eye, behind the patch of trees, just off to the left side of the road. my impression was they didn't want me to take a photo.  it then, soundlessly, ascended and disappeared into the sky.\r\n\r\ni'm 39 yrs. old now.  it was the summer after 8th grade, going into 9th grade.  i remember it as clear as day.  so does my mother, who is
