was at my parents' house. i was in the garden. it was 7 pm. at this moment i decided to take a movie of the sky with my iphone in slow motion mode.  i took a section of the sky randomly.  i've recorded for more or less 10 sec. i didn't notice anything at this point. sky was a bit cloudy.\r\n\r\nwhen i took a look at the video, i saw the ufo. at normal speed (24 fps), it is very hard to see it. in short, at normal speed, the ufo is invisible. when the iphone started the slow motion (240 fps), i noticed the object clearly. it is a grey/black dot. it seems to fly at the level of clouds. this ufo motion is quite strange and it moves very fast: 10 times quicker in the reality than the video. \r\n\r\nfirst i thought: \"it's a kind of fly front of the aperture.\" when a friend of mine told me that the dot color is changing from grey to black and vice versa. meaning that the object is flying at the clouds level. clouds are affecting the object coloration seen from the land.\r\nthen i checked several times the iphone to see if there is a bug or malfunction that affects the camera. but my iphone seems ok.\r\n\r\nnow i would like to know more about this dot. i am a very open minded person and ready to hear a rational or paranormal explanation. if someone can analyze the coloration of my movie to determine the distance between the camera and the object, that could help a lot.\r\n\r\nrecommendations:\r\nplease open the video file in full screen mode. \r\nwhen the slow motion starts, the dot appears basically in the middle of the screen.\r\nit makes few loops and goes

visiting family on the north east shore of lake mcconaughy, and watching an intense thunderstorm several miles to the south. skies were clear over the lake, and with no moon light, stars and milky way were very bright. looking in a ssw direction over the lake, i observed a red blinking light moveing to the ne towards me, maybe a little over a mile in distance. elevation looked to be what a small plane would fly to look at the lake. speed was fairly slow as it took 3+ min. to reach the area of beach i was on, so i assumed it was a small plane, out for a night trip to see what things looked like in the dark out there. my observation was single red light blinking as it aproached, and no other lights. as the object was slightly less than ninty degrees above and just slightly to the west of my location, i observed a dim white light out aways to the front of the red light. it was hard to estimate distance between red center light and dim white light out on the front of the craft, but not real close. i first thought maybe plane escorting or chaseing after small orb, as those were only lights seen. object passed overhead at my guess less than 1500 feet in altitude, and i could not see any features of the craft, other than lights. i thought there was a slight rumble, but a small power generator running nearby covered sound. i quickly looked around in the dark for a witness, seeing an unknown man sitting in a nearby chair, pointed the object out to him. he said c-130 which i quickly discounted, and ran to the north to get away from large cottonwoon trees that obscured object as it flew to the north. to the north i quickly found the object, which started to make a slow turn to the west. this is when two other small dim lights appeared, makeing a very perfect triangle of dim small white lights, with the red light centered. with craft then maybe 1/2 mile away, triangle size was large, but not giant. object made a slow turn to west and then moved to a ssw path back over the lake. i decieded to leave the area to see if i could some how get close again, but lost sight of light.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

helicopters. i got up to take a look and it was a giant flat looking rectangle object in the air with many lights. white and green mostly but i saw red later on. this was quite a long siting (1.5 hours). the sfpd definitely watched this object as well, as they were all over the streets and our bay bridge. they even had a black suv that they escorted onto the bridge during the siting. the suv had a bunch of electronics equipment on it. one of the most interesting things about this siting is that the ufo (or drone?) used a white search light quite brazenly over the city and especially -- aimed at the sf bay bridge. (i live in a high rise condo w a view of the bay bridge and could see this aircraft from multiple angles). the craft hovered near/above the bay bridge and dragged the search light back and forth from span to span. the cops were totally watching this.  another interesting thing about the craft is that it was incredibly loud. aside from myself and the police officers, there really should be a lot of people reporting this siting. i took photos and video with my iphone which are pretty lame unfortunately. i also tried capturing the sound of the craft with the voice memo app on my phone. none of these multimedia files are very good quality.  (about the weather conditions, it was a clear night with just a few clouds but after the thing departed off to the east, an extremely dark cloud/fog bank started to take shape over there. i took a pic of that too b/c it seemed odd.)","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":68021,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.7730422,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07122015-0019","longitude":-122.4063352,"occurred":1436674500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1436693718000,"summary":"Rectangle ufo with many blinking lights and a \"spot/search light\"","tags":["ufo","lights"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"94107","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"San Francisco, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:20707"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Williamstown","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was outside in my front yard and looked up and seen a sphere fly over my house at a high altitude and rate of speed. it went out of sight so i went to my back deck and saw it hovering stationary, i watched it stay stationary for a little over a half hour, then it disappeared. it didn't fly away, just simply vanished. i have pictures of the event.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":68020,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.64122450000001,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07122015-0018","longitude":-84.5563077,"occurred":1428537600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1436693677000,"summary":"Seen an orb typed sphere fly over my house then hover, then vanished.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/68020_submitter_file1__0409152023.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/68020_submitter_file2__0409152016.jpg"],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":24,"maxtempi":75,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":19,"meantempi":67,"meanvism":13,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":15,"mintempi":59,"minvism":2,"minvisi":1,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":24,"maxtempi":75,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":19,"meantempi":67,"meanvism":13,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":15,"mintempi":59,"minvism":2,"minvisi":1,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"41097","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":94,"locationName":"Williamstown, Kentucky","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:20708"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I'm on ufo # 22 over my house. i was in my front yard like i am everyday around 4-430pm. and just like clockwork a ufo shows up. i was shocked the very first time i saw one but i'm use to it now. i just snap pictures. this ufo came down tree level! i was shocked. it seem to be observing me or something else. it hovered for a few moments then took off in a fast speed but not to fast. it did a swing around and this is when i saw the lights on front. i'm still shocked by how low it came.

from over the mountains. the strobe flashed about every two seconds. the light would get lighter and darker like it was shifting east and west over the top of the interstate.  my girlfriend was sleeping in the car next to me and after about two minutes i woke her up to make sure i wasn't going crazy. we had previously been attending a concert so i thought my eyes might be light sensitive. she woke up and saw the lights, about a minute later we rounded a corner that brought us around the side of a mountain and the light became much more visible. the stobing light seemed to go mostly up into the sky and was incredible bright. the source seemed to be behind trees on the left side of the freeway. then suddenly for one strobe the source of the light came compleately into view. it was a perfect sphere and shone a brilliant white light. it was so bright that it appeared to have black lines on it but could have just been my eyes not able to handle the brightness. it felt similar on the eyes to staring into the sun. after about a two second strobe it disappeared and when it next appeared was partially behind some trees back off to my left. it continued to travel the same direction until going out of view behind me. i saw the flash/ strobe re appear in my rear view mirror momentarily about thirty seconds later. this craft was moving extremely speraticly east and west over the interstate and then changed coarse to the left of the interstate after coming into my view. the sphere seemed to disappear between stobes and then re appear at a slighly different altitude or on a different coarse next time it appeared. me and my girlfriend were both shocked and agreed it was a ufo and most likely technology we would never see again in our lifetime. also it began to rain as we were close to the craft. stopped as soon as it went out of view. only rain i've seen all summer in washington ","distance":"101-500

taught me to believe in myself even when nobody else would.I went  fishing one night at this pond in front of this nursing home on a country road where there was a no fishing sign so i was risking getting introuble but still did. so im fishing there and i look up in the sky and there they were . i wasn't scared i was more amazed. they were very close but not close enough where i could get a clear description on what they exactly looked like they were big tho. it was dark but i could still see there shadowy figures almost like they were blending in but not completely  . the lights looked like they were in a triangle formation and moved weird. for some reason i feel like someone else was with me but that part is kind of a blur . i just remember telling the person that was with me look at that, holyyy crap , i got excited. when i first seen the ufos they were just hovering without any noise for acouple of minuts maybe only 1 they were watching me i could sense it. then its like they knew i was looking right at them .They instantly zig zagged back and forth left to right faster then anything i have ever seen with no noise and eventually disappeared . at that point i knew it wasnt man made it seemed impossible. i now believe in the impossible. after that ive only told acouple close people but its like they dont really believe me and or they do but dont really care like i do . maybe its because they never seen what i saw . i care alot about what i seen and want to do something about it but i dont know what i can do . i feel like i didnt see them on purpose its like they chose me . i have a picture i took acouple days ago you guys might want to check out. i showed one person but that person doesnt seem to care that much or think its anything but i know it is for a fact . i took a picture of myself and beside me you can see a weird figure that looks like a invisible alien just half of its face and its eye slanted  almost like a ghost and it kinda looks mad but i dont know . i dont know why i feel like ive been chosen or what for but i feel like they have been with me this whole time as crazy as it sounds . its hard to explain but im a very honest and straight forward person and i know what im talking about.I know the pictures i took mean something i just dont know what . i hope you guys look into this. this is random but if i could choose one job in this world as a dream job it would be in this feild because im fascinated by what ive seen and it never leaves my myned. i would rather show pics directly of my phone so you dont think its been messed with

2210 hours. my teenage son pointed to the east and asked, \"what is that?\"  my wife, daughter, and i turned to observe an orange, pulsating, fiery orb hovering over and beyond a local lighthouse. the orb then moved upwards, hovered, then moved right then left. the orb began to move downwards toward the ocean at a slow steady pace. we observed the orb go behind a low cloud and could observe the cloud illuminated from behind. the object then picked up speed as it was changed direction to the right and we lost sight of the illumination in the cloud.  we went to visit a friend who was also at the campground. at approxately 2250 hours our friend pointed to the sky, in the same direction as before and stated \"what's that?\"  my whole family and i looked up to see the same orb in the same place!  at that time we told our friend what we had observed earlier. this time the orb hovered in one place. i used my iphone and took a short video. not long after i turned off the video, the orb vanished. within a matter of minutes, we observed a fastoving aircraft in the area. i must admit, we watch hanger1 on a regular basis and are somewhat on the fence concerning alien life. my wife has lived in the area her whole life and i've been here 20 years. we have been camping at this campground several times a year for about 8 years and have never seen anything like this before. we have observed several rocket launches from a nearby nasa facilility and this was definitely different.  my son sent the video to two of his friends who also observed the same orb, however they were about thirty miles away.

not to mention, there was someone else who reported a sighting on mufon of the same thing that i've described here almost exactly a month ago, at almost exactly the same spot and the same time and the same characteristics!
