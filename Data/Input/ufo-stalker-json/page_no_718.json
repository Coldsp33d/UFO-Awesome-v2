i could see them and i couldn't because of trees but i noticed a red light possibly 2 hovering over the tree line in my view. i thought it was a reflection of a red light in my room but i double checked and it wasn't a possibility. i watched it for 30 seconds out of my bedroom window while it hovered and i think the 2 became 1. exact distance is hard to judge for me but it wasn't super far away maybe under 1/2 mile looking west towards firework noise but i'm positive it wasn't fireworks. so i left my room and went to my front porch outside and continued to observe it hovering, maybe descending a little and slowly slowly slowly floating to south southwest. it continued that direction and sped up very gradually also it blinked a few times. after estimated 2-3 minutes of actual viewing it just blinked out. it was not a plane or helicopter. there was a helicopter flying east to west around the end of the observation but those are routine couple times a week. i always keep an eye to the sky bc i'm a skeptical believer but this is first time i'm sure ive seen some unexplained flying something. it hovered, blinked, combined (i'm not sure if there was 2 or bc i was looking through a window it appeared to be 2 but i'm 80% sure there was), drifted slowly, then blinked out to summarize.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

certainly observed, but i want to be anonymous and protect the anonymanity of other observers i will refer to.  i was at a community park. about 10 pm thousands of people were there observing a major fireworks display. it was now an hour and a half later but since there were so many fireworks used prior there was a slight haze but clear sky and calm cool air mostly. i observed a person staring up into the sky, the person also got the attention of another person and pointed to something in the sky. i looked into the sky too to see. immediately my attention was caught by a group of lights. the group seemed to be joined and ever slowly moving, like drifting. it was 1000 or more feet up, it was a mile or more to my north. it was a night sky. it was a little confusing, i was trying to get my mind  around what it was that i was seeing. over the course of about the next minute or so i spent concentrating on the group of lights and all the while i was also looking over at the two original guys to see if they were seeing what i was, i was looking around too at other people near me to see if they were noticing. looking back and really studying the object i observed this: it is best described as a geometric outline of lighted or light reflective lines joining whiteish blue lights with a red light someplace too. i could barely make out a 3d quality and that it was a craft. the reason it was difficult to make out was because i was below it but from a distance. i looked upon it from about a 40 degree angle. then it was moving as in drifting to the slight easterly direction, but also slightly moving down in the horizon and the triangle was spinning in the flat but also tilting up too. besides all that, the lights were all coming in and out of brightness, such as building to darker and fading to lighter, i saw the triangle form at first just as a slightly darker sky between the lights in the triangle form, but then as the thing twisted and tilted so i was looking right on from the underneath of the thing the outlines started fading in and out just like the lights were doing. but the lines were dimmer than the lights. once i had seen all the lights on their brightest and the outline lines on their brightest a few times my mind said bingo \"that is one of those flying triangle crafts\"  \"i am actually seeing one of those triangle crafts i have seen on the internet.\" i said to the person i was with \" look a ufo, there. i pointed they looked on and did definitely see it, didn't seem to take it as serious, i said, no, look its a triangle, there see the lines? they did, but didn't seem as impressed as me? i was and still am impressed. i am 100 percent convinced i looked upon a triangle ufo or stealth craft for 2-3 minutes. i watched the thing fade, drift a little more to the east and lower in the horizon until it was just alongside of an outline of a tree that was situated between myself and the thing in the sky? it sort of loitered and faded near the edge of the large tree outline blocking my view, the triangle had dimmed. i hope i communicated that it basically hovered the whole time except drifting and twisting a little. i heard no noise, my environment was loud though? an estimate of size is a guess 60-75 feet long? later on i asked the first onlooker if they  saw it. they said i saw something weird, but don't know if they thought it was a ufo? my opinion it was 100 pct a ufo flying triangle as long as somebody wasn't pulling a hoax.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

flight path the goes directly over my home about once a month. on this day i went out to take some pictures of the bomber as it flew over my home to show on my social media page. i had taken many pictures that day but on the last pass i took 3 pictures in rapid succession. the time period took about 3 seconds. 1 second per picture on my cell phone. picture 1 had the bomber only in it. picture 2 had something behind the bomber. it looked like a small craft roughly about 1/10th the size of the bomber. it was black in color and there looked to be a white light on the back end which to me suggested a exhaust or flame. picture 3 only had the bomber in it once more. the other craft was gone. 30 seconds later as the bomber turned to the west i heard it go supersonic and it broke the sound barrier. they had never done that before on their practice runs. that was the only time. 3 days later 2 bombers returned and did around 7 or 8 low level flights using my home it seemed as a center point where they would turn and fly off into another direction. each flight run came from different directions that day. they did not fly on their normal practice pattern. i compiled the pictures and have enclosed them. to show my sighting. picture 1 shows the sequence of the pictures and the event. the others are the pictures from my cellphone. i have had 4 more sightings of different craft since but all were too far away for my cell phone to pick them up. one shaped like a missile. all white with small square wings on the tail only. one that was just one light in the night sky that met up with a 2nd which was stationary and i thought was a star till it flew off in another directing meeting up with a third that did the same thing. one that flew directly over my home that have 8 barely visible gray lights in a straight line. not one after the other but side by side. one was a formation that i thought was a flock of birds but they flew in too perfect of a formation and when i looked at them in binoculars i could see they were all v shaped craft. white, gray and black in color. i do have each event documented down in a log book i started.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

travelling quickly across night sky changes direction and disappears (2 witnesses).  \r\n\r\nlast night, my 10 year old daughter and i were in the neighborhood pool awaiting the rest of the family.  on this clear summer night, we were gazing into the sky, pointing out stars and were actually watching 2 planes, plus a helicopter fly overhead at different bearings and altitudes.  each was quite typical, with plane-type lights, sounds, and movements.  the helicopter we witnessed, caught far better attention from us because it was lower than the planes (approx 500' high).  we could see the shape, and even opposing red and blue blinking lights, making us think it was a police or law enforcement helipcopter.  it's sound was more muffled that you'd have expected for a helicopter flying as low as it was.  it's shape simply a dark silouhette with no identifiable markings from our distance.\r\n\r\nalmost immediately after the helicopter flew away, my daughter pointed out an object at a much higher altitude, well off to the northeast.  \"dad... what is that?\"  we both watched as this object, which looked like any other star in the sky (as far as brightness and intensity goes) moved in a perfectly straight line in a due west direction for about 20 seconds.  it was slightly pulsating, like some stars do, but appeared to move extremely fast given the distance we watched it cover (having just watched 2 planes).  the object was yellow/ white in color, left a very faint trail behind it which disappeared quickly.  the object seemed to cover what looked like 1-2 miles in just 15 seconds or so.  my reply to her was, \"hon, i have no idea what we're looking at here.\"  \r\n\r\nwe watched closely together for the next 5-10 seconds - talking amongst ourselves about it.  this object moved at great speed in a perfetly straight line across the sky, then suddenly changed its flight direction while we were talking about it.  the change was instant and abrupt, moving a full 45-degrees to the north from how it had been flying, looking like it was almost flying straight up because it disappeared about 3 seconds later an an even greater speed, just vanishing before us.\r\n\r\nthe entire sighting lasted about 30 seconds and my daughter is still talking about this today to me and her friends.  this was definitely one of the odder things we've ever seen together in the skies.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

interrupting our class.  when i was on the bus, traveling westward, my seat was facing west.  i don't know what made me look to the other side, i just decided to look.  the first thing i saw was an object materializing over the mountain range as if out of nothing it then grew in size while simultaneously descending and approaching to hover below the line of the mountain range. i thought maybe it was a helicopter but then in rapid succession 3 more craft perfectly spaced apart from the first object repeated its motion appearing above the mountain and then descending and approaching slightly very quickly and in a perfect curve until all four were hovering just below the mountain range on the horizon.  this captivated my attention and i knew this was something special because the objects were in a perfect straight line perfectly spaced apart, they looked out of place.  \r\n\r\nthe people on the bus looked at me and looked out onto the mountain.  i wanted to shout at them to look!  but i didn't want to scare anyone.  unfortunately i broke my phone earlier that week-end and could not take photographs so i just looked as if my life depended on it.  i was on a moving bus going away from the mountain range but i could see the first object begin to fade and get smaller compared to the other 3 still hovering in the same spot when i could no longer see the formation.  i have been

(east) and suddenly a triangle shaped 'craft' appeared over the top of my house, back a bit. came from behind trees. i was attracted by the three pulsating lights at first. could see they were in a triangle shape. i didn't know what to make of it. never seen anything like it, nor pictures at that time. lights were red (top of triangle), yellowy green and then white. very bright and flashed sequentially. it hovered for about 5 seconds, then shot off south for a little way (about 2 secs) then banked east towards the airport (near the ocean) and disappeared. i felt that was because the lights were now facing away from me. it moved vertically, not horizontally during the time i saw it. there was no sound at all. all i could hear was the highway very, very faintly but no sound from whatever it was in the sky.  was not a plane nor a helicopter nor a drone (unless deathly silent) but did not look like a drone. it was exciting to see it. my son (on the balcony of the house and unable to see it) could hear me describing what i saw. i was at the top of my driveway on a hill. it has been 'playing' on my mind for the past 4 days and i still feel a very strong sense of elation and excitement. the colour looked as though it was black with grey edges. it was a definite triangle.

over the stadium heading due west. we call it the swa flyover. a bright light caught my attention just left of the swa plane, glowing very brightly and appeared to be coming toward the ballpark. the light was very \"star\" like in brightness and appeared out of place. as the swa plane continued west the light became brighter and looked like it was coming closer. i pointed my binoculars at the light and expected to see a helicopter or plane with landing lights but instead saw only a bright light with no contrail, such as we see when a jet is going by. i motioned to my friend that he should look at the light and he too put his binocular on it and said \"what is that?\". i said i didn't know. our attention returned to the game but then a minute later we noticed the light getting closer. what i saw was a very brightly reflective object that was in the shape of a sideways tear drop, more like a very bright kidney bean shape. through the binocular i could see what appeared to be white \"windows\", kind of misty or unfocused shimmering in the middle of the object. it appeared to hover then in a blink started to ascend back towards the se or to my 10 o'clock setting as i saw it and was gone in nothing flat. i have a vivid recollection of the shape and the brightness and how quickly it came and went. as i think about the shape it resembled the pictures i've seen of the shinny art piece in chicago that looks like chrome. i and my other witness both agreed that we saw something, that it appeared and disappeared quickly and are both sort of wanting it to appear again. it has not. others may have seen the light but they did not have binoculars like the two of us did, but there is no one who doesn't think we witnessed a very unusual object that came and left. \r\ni have had a \"happy\" feeling about the sighting, whatever that means. i actually feel special in some sort of funny way that i am a witness to whatever it was.  i don't know why i feel this way but there is absolutely no fear from seeing it. i can sketch what i saw because it's very real to me.
