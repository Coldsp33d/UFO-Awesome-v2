heard the sound of a helicopter very loud so i went out of my room to take a peak, i saw a helicopter very low so i got my iphone and started recording because the helicopter kept coming down over the sea where people was swimming and i thought it was dangerous flying. i didnt notice anything else at the time or see any object. later when i reviewed the footage i noticed a fast movement of something across the screen so i slowed the footage down to look and sure enough there is an object there, after this i reviewed all the footage frame by frame and was schocked because at the start the helicopter goes past a boat and for 2 frames an objeck flies so fast and close to the helicopter. then as the helicopter ascends upwards you can see a translucent object come from behind the clouds and moves fast with strange movement then if flies offscreen and then a second later the object apears solid and moving past the helicopter very fast, this continues a few times and then its gone again. i still have the origanal footage on my iphone. you really have to look frame by frame to see what the object is doing. i got the feeling watching it that it was curious about the helicopter and observing what was happening.At the time maybe there was about 30 people watching but no one noticed the object because it moved so fast that the eye couldnt see it. i have taken screen shots of the video and enlarged it so you can see what it looks like also i will attach the video in real time.","distance":"21-100

would say between the age of 5 and 10 thus making the year of the sighting between the years 2000 and 2005. it was a dark summer night and i was outside in my backyard with my two older brothers. i was jumping on my trampoline while my brothers were sitting on the patio 20 feet away from me. as i jumped on the trampoline i would always look towards these two very tall cell phone towers that were a few miles away from my house. the two towers were the kind of towers that were held up by long cables and have no internal structure so they are basically transparent. as i was jumping i felt this need to look towards those towers. when i looked toward the towers i saw something that i cannot explain, but still remember many years later. i saw a craft that was hovering ever so silently. this craft was like none i have ever seen before. it was huge. probably larger than an commercial airliner i would say. it was shaped like a cigar and had curved edges with no points. it was metallic like a dull chrome. what really caught my eye was the blue inscriptions on the side of the craft that was facing me. the inscriptions glowed a rich royal blue color and it seemed to be some form of pattern that resembled a snake without curves but instead sharp 90 degree angles. i stared at this craft for around 10 seconds. i felt this weird connection to it. like some sort of trance was but onto me and nothing else mattered. nothing else i noticed except for me and the craft. i felt this feeling run through my body as if it was trying to communicate with me. it felt like electricity almost and i couldn't look away. for those 10 seconds i stared at it until my brothers started yelling at me to look up into the sky, and that is when a black stealth fighter plane flew over my house at a very low altitude. it flew so low that the who neighborhood shook. once the plane past overhead i looked back up to the towers and the craft was gone without a trace. i asked my brothers if they noticed the ufo that i saw and they said they had no idea what i was talking about and told me i was seeing things that didn't exist. yes i was a kid when i saw this ufo but i remember what i saw very clearly and i will never forget the feeling i felt from it. it changed my whole outlook on life.

in a band and they practiced in the 9th ward, new orleans. the band had a gig in gretna, la on a saturday night. we all had a great time and shut the place down. now it is about 6am sunday morning; a band member, my boyfriend and myself drove to the 9th ward to pick up the equipment at the band member's house. the three of us joked about,'how did we get to be the only ones to pick up the equipment at 7:20 in the morning!'. the joking went on as we finished up and we departed. my boyfriend and i had about a 25 minute drive to marrero, with no traffic and taking the westbank expressway hi-rise. even with traffic, i could make that run, knowing shortcuts, ok. when we got to the other side of the g.N.O. bridge, i saw a shpere hovering over the tree line and was behind a cruise ship that was coming around the bend. i said, \"is that the sun? no it can't be. what is it?\". my boyfriend says, \"oh that's the sun.\". i was already going through the process of elimination, and i see the sun to the east and said, \"no! that is the sun! this thing is facing south.\". the sphere looked bronze/golden color, the height was as big as two maybe three cruise ships stacked on top of each other, but not as wide. it might be able to fit in the super dome, on the field. of course, i am still driving at this point, slowed down a little bit, when i first saw it, but not much. as we are pondering this sighting, i am thinking of going to where we can observe it, but got nervous. we are on the w.B.Hi-rise and i take the first exit to get to ground level. i just did not want to be where it can see us, i do not know why. i felt a little frightened. we said that we would not tell anyone. we get home, as we are coming inside, his dad is going out to look for us. his dad said, \"there ya'll are! i was coming to look for you\". we said, \"why?!\". dad said, \"b/c it is 11 o'clock! ya'll are never this late, the morning after a gig\". although i drove the ground level to get home, after the sighting; it should not have taken that long to get home. i timed that run many, many times after that and even w/traffic, it does not take 3.5 hours to drive from st. claude bridge to ames and laplaco blvd. we did tell our parents and close friends, and till this day do not know what happen in the time we lost. i never saw anything like that again. i always wonder if anyone saw it that day.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

some of the other witnesses had fireworks they planned on setting off.\r\nthere was a group of around 10 kids. we had several camping and partying spots in the wooded area nearby my home. we would often spend time there building fires, cooking hotdogs and other stuff teens did. we had a large fire going i remember that.\r\nsomeone (don't remember who) spotted a very bright light off to the north in the same woods. as there were rival \"gangs\" of teens in the area that also partied in the same woods, we figured that there was another party going on. we had also built a nice fort in that area we used in the winter, and someone mentioned that maybe someone was burning down our fort (that's how bright the light was suddenly)\r\nmyself and perhaps 4 others (i do have the names of most of the others, but as recently as 2010 when i ran into one of them and mentioned the event, they became quite upset and didn't want to discuss, so i am doubtful they would come fwd) got up from our seats and hiked towards the light.\r\nas we got closer it suddenly became apparent that the light was a spherical object floating around just under treetop level (perhaps 40 feet up). it was round, but far to bright to look at directly. i remember seeing shades of violet and gold flashing in the mix. if you placed your hand up to block the light, and peered between your fingers you could make out the spherical shape.\r\ni remember yelling out \"what in the hell is that\"?\r\none friend brian at the same time started screaming and yelling that they were going to take us. he took off through the woods back in the opposite direction (later we found out he went home to get his dad)\r\nseveral other at the same time also broke down and started sobbing. i was not the oldest there. the two that really freaked out were older than me...Perhaps 16 at the time.\r\nonly one stayed with me trying to get closer to the light.\r\nas we did, it began wobbling and humming loudly and started moving right towards us, dropping down near the ground.\r\nwe (of course) ran off away from it. after maybe running 100 yards and stopping to take a break, i looked back and saw that the sphere was once again heading back in the other direction, now kind of dipping and bobbing as it weaved it's way between large trees.\r\nthe same thing continued on for another full 30-45 minutes (i think)\r\nwe moved towards it, it turned towards us. we turn away and it turned away. it no doubt was responding to us. during this time, several of the kids that were back at the fire and saw the kids running and screaming away, came to join us out of curiosity i am sure.\r\none of them was the oldest in the group (brian's older brother) and after standing near the light (maybe 50 yards away) he also began babbling nonsense about being taken and began crying uncontrollably. all this of course was pretty traumatic to me, a 13 yr old.\r\nthen i heard brian (who had returned with his father, and their house was a good half mile from our spot in the woods) yelling at us to get away from the object. when we ran back to him and saw he had his dad with him we all kind of expected some kind of sense to be made, as we now had an adult with us!\r\nhis dad stood there slack-jawed, himself just muttering some nonesense. then the object got much brighter, like it was going to explode...Amd shot off fast through the trees.\r\nwe all ran after it. (including brian's dad)\r\nit came out of the woods into a clearing from an old abandoned apple orchard, where we could all finally see the night sky.\r\nthe object wobbled around maybe 100 ft off the ground and again grew brighter. then, it shot off at perhaps a 45% angle up into the night sky and then stopped dead in the sky. we all saw it sitting there (at this time there was only four people. me mike, brian and brian's dad)\r\nit was far brighter than a star now, and perhaps the size of a dime held at arm's length.\r\nthen, there was a flash and it broke into two objects. the bright white half shot straight up into the sky leaving a streak.\r\nthe other part, red, fluttered down slowly beyond the horizon, with a path looking like a leaf falling down from a tree.\r\nbrian's dad did call the cuyahoga falls police to report it when we went home.\r\nthey admitted they had other reports of odd lights, but said \"what do you want us to do about it?\"\r\n\r\nit has bothered me for years not reporting this. \r\n\r\nmy parents have had a close encounter years earlier(ufo hovered over their car, car stalled, etc) and my father won't barely admit anything happened. my mother (now deceased) was quite upset. years later when communion was released, she became obsessed with ufos and abductions and told me the cover of streiber's book scared the hell out of her and she had to buy it.\r\n\r\ni also years later had another encounter while fishing at night with a friend. i have details on that as well...And recently spoke to that friend and he only remembers the bright flash when the object left from hovering over our small boat. i recall more than just the flash. i recall the beam illuminating the boat. i remember both us us looking up and seeing the bottom of something large above us and then there was a flash as it basically just disappeared!\r\n\r\ni am willing to discuss this is person if desired. the events described above have led me on a very strange journey in my 55 years of life. i have an immense library of ufo literature. i spend a lot of time star gazing. i rally would like to someday understand better this event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

brother and i decided to go to taco bell for dinner. as we left her house, we came up to the round about, i was sitting in the back of her blazer. i looked into the sky just over the tree line, their i noticed 4 red or amber lights in a horizontal line. all 4 lights was evenly spaced out. i then shouted to my girl friend to go left and stay on pfe, it's this little back road near are house. as we continued down pfe road the 4 lights that i saw just moments ago was now 7 light in a horizontal line, but now i'm not the only one viewing it, my girl friend then stops the car and we sit on the side of the road watching. her brother just kept asking what are those lights doing, what are they but me and my girl had no answer for him. as we continue watching thing just got strange, the 7 lights we was viewing started making shapes in the sky. they started out horizontal all spaced out evenly right above the tree line, then in a blink of an eye they were all vertical straight line still evenly spaced out, they did 4 more shaps that i would have to draw out but i rember them clear as day. anyways after all the shapes they did one by one each light disaperd. it reminded me of a dim switch, the lights would slowly get dimmer till it was gone. well after witnessing this the 3 of was scared but we continued to taco bell to get our dinner, as we got there and drove into the line, i looked up again and to my amazement i see the same colored lights but this time only 3 and it's in a triangle formation. so i hop out the blazer and point to the sky and other people look up and see what i'm seeing. this object was moving so slow with no sound what so ever. and i wanna say that if this triangle was a solid object then it was huge, i mean big big big. well anyways as we watch this thing fly over us i noticed a blinking light from the corner of my eye, it was a small plane heading straight for us. now mind you i can hear this plane lol not the object. then as the plane makes its way over us its now under this object. and like i said before this object was big, when we watch this plane fly past it looked like a little toy compared to the object. but as the plane was passing, the lights disappeared just like before, just dimmed out and it was gone. me my girl and her brother was confused by all this. we did not know what to think, we did agree on one thing, what we saw couldn't have man made. with how fast they moved and the creepiness and dead silence.\r\n\r\n another thing to note is that 2 months after this sighting me and my girlfriend saw the same type of lights again but it was only 2 and they was flying very low and fast coming right at us then suddenly took a shap right and disappeared. then 4 months after that i'm with my little brother heading to winco, grocery store. we park i and get out and for some reason i just looked up and saw over 2 dozen lights and i yield out to my brother because he was still in the car. he then gets out and we both started watching these lights dance around in the sky and other people in the parking lot was looking at us because i was pointing at the sky the whole time and this lasted mybe 2 or 3 mins before they all disapeard.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

girlfriend i was just looking at the stars it was a clear dark sky. it was a no moon light with a beautiful sky. i suddenly saw a orangish-red i knew exactly knew what it was. it was a ufo. i could tell because i am a researcher on this topic for a long time now because of an incident that happened with me when i was 9.I love to research on aliens and ufo's. so that thing was around the corner of my building and then it came hovering in the front and that thing was like 800 ft above my head it was scary cause once it came above my head it stopped i kept on observing it. my phone started fluctuating it's signal strength and it was like i went through time loop . why i am saying this because when i saw the duration of the call it was 14 mins bt after i stared observing the ufo  when i checked my phone again it showed 25 mins my gf was shouting \"hello??? hello are there??? hello???\" i said i didn't go anywhere it felt like seconds bt about 10 mins had passed by!!! i cut the phone call call and quickly clicked a pic of the ufo. it started to hover once again this time towards east . it was hovering at at a very slow speed no helicopter or plane could do that. it disappeared for 2-3 mins. it once again came in the front stopped for 3 mins approx. and then suddenly it it went up in the sky with a blink of an eye. i know that i'm reporting this really late bt i found the mufon site a little late. i have     \r\nall their episodes on history tv 18. after this incident there have been 4 more sightings around my area. just after the incident a plane flied the same path of departure of that ufo that was in my guesses was tracking of an ufo's activicties thereafter. thank you for reading.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and other areas of metro detroit on july 4, 2015. the sky was clear and the temperature around 78 degrees with the usual stars in the sky very clear and visible.  no planes overhead either.  the neighbors were firing off fireworks as usual for the fourth of july holiday.\r\nour aunt who lives in westland, about 8 miles south of us called at 10:17 pm on july 4, 2015 saying she was seeing strange red lights in the north sky moving slowly and methodically from west to east.  so we went outside and looked into the south-southwest sky and saw a strange looking red light in the form of an orb or circle moving slowly across the sky from west to the east.  then about 6 more started appearing, one at a time, in the same sky moving from west to east.  they moved slowly and then eventually formed a c like formation but about 3 minutes later they moved into a j like formation.  after another few minutes the lights started to move towards each other and then started fading two lights into one.  each of the six lights in turn moved to the next highest in the sky and the two became one and then the next one left doing the same thing fading into the next highest red light until there was only one red light left.  when there was only one red orb left it slowly faded away without any sound or exhaust.  i even used binoculars but they just appeared to be a bright red light.  they did not have any shape like a plane or helicopter and there was no sound coming from these red orbs.\r\nafter this first group faded out or basically travelled to the east out of sight we went onto our back deck and observed more of the same in the north sky.  the exact same thing happened that we observed in the front yard.  one at a time, travelling from west to east they were bright red until eventually forming another c formation that eventually morphed into a j like formation in the north-northeast sky.  after a couple of minutes one at a time they started flying slowly into the highest light and each in turn disappeared into it.  when only the one red light was left, it slowly faded away and then nothing else was seen in the sky anywhere.  after the fireworks were finished by 11 pm the red orbs had stopped showing up.  it seemed like the red orbs were somehow trying to react to the fireworks going off in the sky.  but the red orbs were much higher in the sky then any fireworks that were fired into the sky.  the red orbs by the way they were moving must have been under some kind of intelligent guidance.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1
