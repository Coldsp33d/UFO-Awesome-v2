closest family and friends. those who know me well enough to know i do not lie nor do i embellish stories. \r\n\r\nbetween august, 1976 and may, 1979 i attended fernwood junior high school, pass road, biloxi, mississippi 39531 for my 7th, 8th and 9th grade years.  so it has been nearly 40 years since my ufo experience. that being said, though i am a little vague on the exact date or time  the circumstances are still as clear in my mind as if they had happened yesterday. \r\n\r\none evening i was among a group of kids who had just finished band practice.  there were probably 7-9 of us waiting for our parents to pick us up. if i remember correctly it was for concert band and it had to have been at least 8:00pm or 8:30pm, maybe a little later than that. after practice was finished we were all huddled at the back of the school where it looked over the  football field.  on the other side of the field was an area of woods and past that lie the beaches. it was completely dark outside and i don’t remember being cold so i believe it was in the late summer or early fall sometime between september and december.  the sky was completely clear and illuminated by only the stars and the moon with a faint glow from some street lights on the front side of the school (north of our position) and from the businesses which lined beach blvd, approximately a mile away on the other side of the woods, to the south.  biloxi was east of or location and gulfport was to our west.  also lying east of our location was keesler air force base.  my father was stationed there. \r\n\r\nwe were all gathered and just talking. when someone in the group noticed a bright light that appeared at the top of the trees.  since it was on the other side of the field i estimate it was approximately 200 feet +/- away from or location and based on the its position above the field i estimate that it had an approximately diameter of 40-60 feet.  it was a bright white sphere that was completely silent and slowly glided just above the tree line towards the direction of gulfport until it was out of our line of sight.  it only took about 30 seconds for it to disappear past the tree tops. \r\n\r\nafter a moment of silent disbelief a buzz of talking incurred with questions about the source of the light but what happened next really sent the conversation into a frenzy.  as i said the sphere was completely silent but approximately 20 seconds after it disappeared a group of helicopters came into view at the top of the trees to our east. they were not in a straight line but in some kind of formation spread out from the tree line towards the beach. we heard them loud and clear before we even saw them (which squashed the point that the sphere was too far away for us to hear) and they followed the same exact path across the top of the trees, east to west, hurriedly scanning below with search lights, along their path, as they passed the school.  about that time we heard our parents blow their car horns and we went running up to the front of the school. we loaded into the car (i was riding with a friend) and excitedly began to describe our experience. we were headed east on pass road towards home. i lived in thrower park, which was base housing.  no sooner had we started driving down pass road when 4-5 police cars, with lights and sirens blaring, sped past us in the direction of gulfport. this only fueled our speculations. the next day i looked in the newspapers for any word of the events of the previous evening but there was nothing.  of course we spoke of it at school and i kept watch in the papers for several weeks but eventually gave up on finding out what happened that night.  \r\n\r\nover the years i have thought of our experience often and wondered about the truth but in my mind i have no doubt about what we saw. during my father’s 20 year career in the air force he worked on mission specific equipment for aircraft and i was in and around aircraft frequently when i would visit the hangers where he worked.  some of the mission equipment he worked on was for the hurricane hunters and i was very aware of what a weather balloon was and what it looked like.  so much so that as a child i wanted to grow up to be a weather person. i was captivated by weather and the hurricane hunters. we had also lived in albuquerque, new mexico and been to the hot air balloon festivals on several occasions, during my childhood.  \r\n\r\ni wish i could say i remember the date and the names of the other kids who were present that night but other than my recollection of the experience and a few nicknames i am at a loss.  how i wish we had the internet then.  i may not have been able to find any information back then but i have never forgotten and would love to know if there is anyone else out there, who went to fernwood junior high during that period, and who has not forgotten either.\r\n","distance":"101-500

the bedroom door to confront the intruder, but was suddenly rendered unconscious as i touched the doorknob. i woke up clothe-less and cold in a pill-shaped, glass container. the lid was open, so i was able to stumble out onto the floor around the container. i felt drugged and could barely walk, but i thought i'd been kidnapped by someone so i was urgently trying to find an escape route. the room i was in was made of composite materials, namely concrete and plastic with florescent lights. i limped into a hallway that was tunnel-shaped and followed a blue glow coming from down the hall. as i walked, i came out of the tunnel and entered a large cylindrical room lined with vehicles on hooks along the walls. they were human vehicles, mostly japanese and german cars/motorcycles, but some vehicles were clearly from the american military. \r\n\r\nin the center of the room was what looked like a metal tree that was six stories tall with glowing blue leaves, but upon closer inspection, this tree was a large metal cylinder and the leaves were capsules much like the one i'd woken up in, except these still had people inside them and were radiating a neon blue glow. as i drew my eyes further up the tree, i noticed some blue wires moving around in the dark area toward the ceiling. these clumps of wires suddenly floated down toward me and turned to reveal that they had faces in them, each with two large dark eyes and narrow slits for noses and mouths. it's hard to describe, and i hate to put it this way, but think of a stereotypical \"gray alien\" face and picture it floating in a tangled up mess of tentacles. there were three of them, one smiling, two frowning. there was an exchange of words and charades between myself and the smiling one for roughly 10 minutes, but i was so exhausted and they were so advanced that there was no pertinent information shared between us. \r\n\r\ni passed out, then woke up again face-down in a puddle of my own drool on a glass floor. i was too tired to move, so i tilted my head up just enough to take a look around. the room was circular, was about 150 sq. ft. in size, and a bright sterile white color. one of the tentacle creatures was in the room but was busy facing away and operating a set of strange controls with no buttons or levers. i laid my head back down, but saw through the glass floor that we had risen out of a deep black hole that was dug into a grassy plain. a rock-shaped lid closed around the hole to cover it as we flew further up. this is when i realized i was in a spacecraft, and we had actually been in a silo of some sort that's here on earth somewhere. i passed out and was awoken to the sensation of being dropped back-first onto my bed with a hard thud. i checked my phone and it read 6:30am. the whole trip had been exactly five hours.\r\n\r\ni'm not going into any further detail, but i found an object had been inserted and cauterized into my right leg, and i had a run-in with some men in suits within four days of the abduction. i've never believed in abductions or ufo's or mib or any of that, but now i've got no choice. i'm annoyed that there's no official place to get legitimate information or help on this subject since the experience was traumatic and any kind of clarity would help fix that. mufon is the closest i've found, so this is where i'm reporting this information. hopefully it helps someone somewhere.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"05:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s), Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

trail from las vegas to pioneer saloon in goodsprings, nv via potosi pass...Forest service road: #582. it's 30 miles and about a 3 hour trip through amazingly beautiful terrain mostly along a bunch of power lines.\r\n we were somewhere in the first 1/3rd of the trail and we weren't too, too far passed the last house and the boy scout campgrounds when i saw this awesome cloud formation that looked like a phoenix flying and asked to stop for a photo opportunity.  \r\ni believe, thinking back, that we had just gotten through this really cool crook in the road that had a \"tiny canyon\" feel to it. it really wasn't much more than a few little crooks in the road.\r\n i snapped a picture with my cell phone upright and then turned my cell on it's side to get the second shot; lengthwise. \r\n much farther down the trail i notice the 3 circles but we really didn't have the time to investigate it further(way passed that spot by then) until i'd downloaded them to my pc for a better look. \r\n the second picture was taken just a few seconds from the first, both through the opened window; just got the truck's windows tinted a few weeks prior so i know the window was down. 1st picture is normal and the 2nd picture held a very unique circular cloud configuration directly under the \"phoenix\"...After noticing the circles i took lots of pictures of the scenery and clouds...I have some weird spots in the clouds in a lot of them but nothing like this. \r\n i showed the \"phoenix\" pictures to my bf and he, nor i, has ever seen anything like this before. he's a witness to the short duration it took to snap the 2 pics. \r\n he wanted to keep moving because we planned to go to pioneer saloon and be off the trail before dark. we got into goodsprings between 6 and 7pm. \r\n personally, it looks like a portal. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,

sleep in forest,something wakeup me at night i woudlike going piss then i so somebody illuminated eyes first i think its animal.Then it came to me that around me is very quiet, no noise of trees, the sound of my walk is complete silence.When i tried to slowly withdraw two figures, they caught me from behind at the height of the elbows.Then white blue light appeared, steel fossils of fear i was put in the middle of the vehicle, they stoned me in the middle when they called the rest outside, only the red light was burning, they closed the door, we quickly got to the top i felt that we were floating up quickly.The ship which we flew into a much larger ship were in the middle of other ships and from that time i remember only at random what happened to me, i remember the woman in the glazed hall next to where they hooked her some kind of tube, the woman started to grow belly and after 3 5 minutes they took birth, i remember the woman's horror and fear in her eyes.There were constant 2 figures like on the ship and someone who called himself the doctor was higher than them, he also had a few hairs on his head. when i lay on the table i talked with them in my language but they are very tired,we started talking telepathically with say honestly do not remember what i spoke to them.They did terrible things to me, they stuck needles in the eye, they took sperm, they stuck the needle in my head ... and a lot of other things,i was with them for 4 days in different places, i was also on the ground i remember a tall glass building, i remember the elevator ride to the top i remember that there were two strangers in the elevator was a man in uniform with some stripe on the front pocket and left sleeve, he looked at me with pity and anger at them. when we drove up, i could see through the huge glass windows of the roofs of houses, streets lit by lanterns, i wanted to see someone, but the streets were empty.We entered a large room where there were a lot of smaller rooms separated by screens, there were about 20 patients under cover, some people looked there like doctors i do not remember what they were doing to me or what was next. the last thing i remember is how they pierced me with a thick tube in my nose i remember the crunch of a bone with the same ship i returned to the ground they opened the door and i could go out for me some 10 km farther than they took me.When i was standing in the door, i was wondering where i was and what is the year. when i left i saw only one figure in the door. i was on the sidewalk after 10 m, i heard a voice that screamed stop,i did not respond start calling me my name and surname,two gentlemen approached me, they walked very strangely as if they had no knees voice as if it came from a metal belly though they moved their mouths i saw their black car a lot of chromium invisible what could be a brand, i saw it for the first time,they ordered me to forget everything, that i would not tell anyone about it because otherwise my family would take care of it.Then i saw on my hand a glowing stamp with different colors that disappeared after 5 minutes.When they left me, i started to run to my sister's house, i was cruising when i ran into her home, i started drinking water with liters,when my sister saw me, i was very scared, i was confused with the poster i tried to hide. very scared of my eyes, she said that they are very magnified and i look like a madman she kicked me out of the house, i did not say anything about what happened to me 10 years ago, i told only my wife.17 years ago, the x-ray doctor of my head found something like half a grain of rice. that's what i wanted to tell you.I apologize for writing but i use an online

way to work, exiting freeway around 6am.\r\ni noticed a triangle shape that registered in my mind as a cloud for some reason.\r\nbut no other clouds in sky. sun was coming up, hitting object, causing portions of invisibility of the object. as if sun was making it transparent.\r\nthis object hovered there, and i had to go to work, so the amount of time i was able to view it was around 5 minutes. my work is near this location, and when i arrived, i looked again fro the object, and did not see it. it must have either gone, or went completely transparent in the sunlight. my biggest question is: how can a cloud be a perfect triangle shape? i've never seen anything like it before.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":88981,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12212017-0018","longitude":null,"occurred":1511222400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1513868514000,"summary":"Hovering
