4th of july fireworks that ended 1/2hr prior. the sky was overcast with some bright stars and, i believe, the constellation sagitarius visible directly above. i'm not sure of exactly which one, whatever, but i then looked nw along the ridge line, we live along the kanawha river valley, and saw the ufo.\r\nit was a bright red and orange egg-shaped object, no more than 2-5mi away, in a stationary position and that is when i went for my iphone 5s and started to record video after all were in agreement that it was what i was seeing. in the video you will hear a female voice describe it's movement, but it remained in a still position for a few minutes and then headed along the ridge line toward us. as it came closer i was able to notice the lights in the middle and they were a greenish color, the lights were extremely bright so it was hard to be certain of the middle color, but from there it appeared as if the top and bottom were disjointed leaving me to believe that it was also \"wobbling\" as it was in motion.\r\nafter the motion it once again stopped for a few moments and i got a straight on look at it once again. it was now in a steady position as if it were \"checkin' us out\" and from there it headed straight upwards. now to explain the \"vanishing\" is kind of hard to detail due to it being night and also being unaware of the specific cloud cover, but i can only give two theories as to what i saw from there. regardless of clouds the lights were so bright that it would have been hard for the clouds to hide so much of it so easily right away. what i saw is it looked like it dissipated as if it went through a \"worm-hole\" kind of like einstein explained in his theory of relativity and the 4th plane or dimension. i'm not a ufo enthusiast and i'm not college educated, but i am a navy veteran and was taught attention to detail, so that is the basis for the recollection...","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

friends with the people who owned the 2 cottages nest to us. the adults went in the boat to the bar across the lake and left all of us kids, approximately 10-12 of us, at the cottages. it was after dark so probably between 9-10 pm. we were outside playing and noticed 3 discs with 3 different colored lights on the perimeter edge. i'm not positive but i think the lights were spinning around the edge or blinking. they were located northwest to where we were, towards madison. they sat there and we discussed them and one of the older girls said that it was a flying saucer or ufo. they weren't too high above the horizon and were across the lake from us. no sound or movement was noticed. we got scared and ran into the nearest cottage. we told the adults when they got back but they didn't see anything. i recently asked my sisters about it and one remembered the event as i do, one said she doesn't remember it at all, and i never heard from my 3rd sister. i don't know how to get a hold of the other people. i would have been about 9 or 10. the cottage was torn down a long time ago and was replaced by a large home.

his wrist that he told me was a tan line from his military watch, it was a permanent tan line. the tan line was visible for more than 30 yrs. my grandfather had served in the army at first, where he was in watch towers, and seen alien aircraft the first time in panama. during his time he contracted malaria, and was sent home. he than enlists and works for the air force, where he met my grandmother and married her. my father was conceived during this time my grandfather was in the air force in ohio at right patterson afb, and he was born 4/24/1954, full term he weighed 3 lbs. my father was 2 years old and his blood turned to water. my grandfather had to give him blood transfusions around the clock, after two transfusions the doctors did not want to try to save my father after two failed attempts, and my grandfather insisted, and signed a release that he waived the doctors medical liability in order to try one last transfusion. luckily my father lived. my father age 17 he became government property and received 30 shots a day of human growth hormones daily. at that time my father was only 4 ft 10 inches. my father did make the height of 5 ft 3 inches, and weighed 85 lbs. at the age of 37 yrs old my father was diagnosed terminally ill with stage 4 adenocarcinoma. which was typically seen in a 80 year old patient and died with in 6 months of his diagnoses. upon his death my mother and i received a letter from the united states asking for autopsy results and slides of the cancer. unfortunately no autopsy was done, and for some reason we never were informed that the experimental treatments my father was given may of caused cancer. i was not even sure how the government was informed that my father had died. back in 1992 there was no computers not like today. and we never even were aware that the government was even interested. my grandfather also in the 1960 s was sent to california, from michigan. they lived there for apporoximetly one year, and moved back to mi. which is how my parents met. my father and mother were next door neighbors and good friends since the age of 7 years old. my grandfather only spoke of the aliens once my father had died. i was 21, and i visited him weekly. he told me that yes there were aliens, and he did indeed see them at right patterson base, and in the watch towers while in panama. my grandfather did take most of the secrets with him to his grave. it was so much of a shock for me to hear him speak of this, because he never really did, i wish i would of asked him more. he was so admirable, my father and he were a masters at building electrical and could learn any skill or trade. they were so intelligent and mastered any skill they tried. i find it upsetting that the government possibly knew that my father was exposed to cancer causing agents and even knew he passed and how to send information asking for autopsy results, yet could not inform him that he was at risk and to go have a regular medical check up. my grandfather also died of cancer 15 years later.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

eyes enough to see that i am still inside my room. i saw human like figure standing next to my bed. it was between 1.40-1.55 meters tall, dark-grey skin, 3 long fingers on each hand, big black eyes. i was unable to see it's feets because it was standing next to my bed, and bed sheets was covering both of his legs.\r\n   few seconds after i manage to open my eyes a little bit, i hear my brother (which bed is next to mine) take a deep breath, like he wasn't able to breath certain amount of time. i watch that creature directly into eyes and suddenly i wasn't paralyzed any more. it turned head and looked trough window. when i realised that i am no longer paralyzed, i stand up and approach to window, i wasn't afraid of alien creature behind me. i look trough window and saw many flying ships on sky going over top of next building (20-25 m high). flying objects was different in shapes and sizes. i wasn't anymore in my room, i could see approximatly between 300 and 400 flying ships. surface of flying objects was black without any reflection. but borders of windows (or i don't know what exactly, square shape) was glowing with light blue or yellow light. i hv seen it so clear, any border, bend, nut or window on that flying objects, without any blur or fog. so many flying ships was surrounding me, i only could see earth beneath. shape of ships was irregular square, triangle, and smaller ships was arrow like with flat nose. biggest ships was around 30 x 20 x 150 meters, and have something like landing pads for smaller ships. triangle shaped ships was very similar to b2 military aircraft, but double in size and with flat nose. medium size ships was grouped around biggest ships in circles, and around that in formation was placed triangle-shaped ships. all ships was going in one direction in formation like fleet of some kind.\r\n   next thing i remember i was in my bed at about 8 am (local time). i asked my brother about last night, but he doesn't remember anything because he was in deep sleep, but my mother hear something sneaking around the house last night, but she assumed that was just the wind and continue sleeping.\r\n   i didn't report anything to

what he was talking about, at first glance these lights appeared to be a plane flying over. we are use to seeing and hearing planes fly by all the time, but this was no airplane or helicopter. this was a ufo flying low over mobile homes and a hill close by, a mile from our home. the ufo appeared out of no where with orange, red an white color ufo.  seeing this ufo live was amazing, because it appeared to be pretending to be a plane flying low.Fire works where going off, with the ufo appearing to like the show. but got spoked when a fire work exploded close to the ufo, this is when the ufo took off at unbelievable speeds. this is freaky technology these aliens or other entitys of some kind have a craft that can move like nothing we have on planet earth. this is not my first rodeo,i have seen ufos in the past at my home where i grew up. the good news is i manage to record this event with my smartphone, finally i have some proof to share. my girlfriend had her smart phone as well and captured this event, i have been reading, watching documentaries on ufos and other real life events that happen around the world. i truly believe in ufos, it's just a reality to me now.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  this is my ufo close encounter that happened in the summer of 1974 in the city of willowick, ohio which is an eastern suburb of cleveland located in lake county(we were right on the lake erie shoreline).It was approximately 10:30pm(et) in the evening when this incident occured. myself and my three friends were walking down the street(e.324th st.) going north towards lake erie heading to the beach at the end of the street where we would often hang out(we were all 17 years old and in between 11th and 12th grade at high school). my house was at the end of the street on the corner. when we were about halfway down the road(parkland crossroads-about 300 yards from the lake)we noticed some strange lights at the end of the street just above the intersection of lakeshore blvd.And e.324th st. we continued walking towards the lights and as we got closer we could see that it was a disc-shaped craft with white round lights going around the middle. it was hovering silently in the same spot at treetop level over the intersection. we continued to walk towards it until we were standing directly underneath the object which was still hovering right above us(it was black in appearance and somewhat larger in diameter than the intersection).We all looked up at it in amazement wondering what it was and why it was there. we stood under the craft observing it for about 10 minutes; then it started slowly drifting horizontally north towards the lake. we followed it across the street to the cliff and down the steps to the beach until we were right under it again. it continued to drift at the same level until it was just over the water when it stopped and suddenly shot straight up vertically into the night sky (no sound) till it was at cloud level in about 2-3 seconds. it then stopped and the lights changed from a circular pattern to a triangle pattern(3 white lights). it then took off at a high rate of speed north towards canada till it was out of sight(there was only like a one second pause in between the two directional changes). after it left we were feeling totally confused and could hardly believe what we had just witnessed. we talked about it for awhile trying to understand what we had just seen, and then we eventually made our separate ways home, still in a state of shock. we told some people about it the next day but no one believed us. we went on with our lives after awhile but the encounter was always in the back of my mind over the years. i wished i would have asked some of the neighbors in the area if they had seen it and i wished i would have had a camera. i don't have photos but the images of the sighting were recorded vividly in my mind(memory). some things that i thought were odd about the incident: 1)no traffic(vehicles)came through the intersection or down the road the whole time of the encounter(about 30 min.) 2)the craft waited till it got over the water to take off(when we weren't under it). 3)the craft transformed from a circular light pattern to a triangle pattern when it got up high in the sky. 4)when i was first standing under the ufo i suddenly got this feeling that a blue light was going to come out of the craft and beam us up to it.I had a momentary feeling of fear about that, but most of the encounter was exciting and fascinating(could the occupants possibly have had a device like that?). sorry it took so long to report this sighting but we didn't have the internet and camera cellphones back then, and we didn't know about mufon or nuforc. i thought for a long time that it was to late to report it but i recently saw a tv show about people who have had similar experiences that didn't report it for 30 years or so but when they got older they needed to get their story out to the world.It gave me hope that my story might be taken seriously. i'm hoping that someone that lived in that area at the time and saw it might read this and come forward also to report it(or try to contact me)so my story could be verifyed. this happened in a dense suburb so i know someone else had to have seen it.

on a smoke break when we thought we saw what looked like a meteor once in a while but was funny because it didn't go across the sky like you normally see. it move fast across the sky in one direction then another direction but when we both saw it we looked at each other and we both were freaking out we had time to talk about what we were seeing when this object became 90 degrees above us and it came straight down we both hit the deck as it came directly down at us and disappeared. as it came down it became larger and larger, then one big flash  i was so scared my friend and i both talked about it and agreed never to talk about it because people would think we were crazy. i am now  wondering if there have ever had anything like this happen to anyone else","distance":"21-100

alone outside of my home observing the stars when the object would go over. i described the glowing object to family members. my wife and i seen this once also. i called my daughter outside on two sightings and she also saw the object. then one night i was telling my other daughter and her husband about these sightings while walking out to their car, and he looked up and said like that. i said yes, then that one turned 90 degrees from the first flightpath and sped off quickly getting smaller as it left our view. that one lasted only about 30 seconds or so.\r\ni have no idea what these were, sometime they would seem to hover or move slowly they were very bright and sometimes close with no noise. other times they would go over at a higher altitude but quite below the clouds, again not making any noise. i felt like that if i told someone they wouldn't believe what i had saw. that is why i would tell my wife, daughters and son in law about them. they were called outside to view some of them with me just to make sure, i was seeing what i thought i was seeing. well: at least they said if i was crazy, then they were to, because they saw it. for a while there i had been watching for shooting stars on clear to slightly cloudy nights when i would see these things. sorry i can't give a better description and have no photos, i can't tell what i don't know. i don't know quite a lot about these. the time my son in law and daughter saw that one it was traveling from south to north slowly and then turned east very quickly leaving quick and fading out of sight. witnesses were at different times, wife, two daughters and  a son in law. i got to wondering if these things were watching me, so i quit checking for them. wierd !","distance":"501 Feet - 1
