the back porch  looking east  when a red electrical looking light similar to the aurora borealis, but circular in appearrance  appeared from out of nowhere in the sky. my first impression was that it was fireworks due to the time of year.  after about six or seven seconds the red hazy electrical glow disappeared, and bright red lights came into focus.  there were three bright red lights that  appeared to run down the length of the outer edges of the craft, which was triangular in shape.  although i could see the lights,  they appeared to be going in and out of focus. the lights started moving  slowly toward my direction. i opened the back door and was yelling for my wife to come look. my adrenaline was through the roof. as i turned back around the the craft stopped and hovered for a few seconds, and then slowly started moving in a northerly direction. as soon as it started to move north the appearance changed to a fuzzy red orb and slowly moved across the sky until it disappeared behind the tree line. as soon as it disappeared, i ran inside and turned on the tv thinking that other people would have seen it.  as of now i have not talked to or heard of anybody else seeing this sighting. i thought this to be unusual, because in my 51 years on this earth, i have never seen anything that compared to what i saw that night. i get goosebumps and my adrenaline starts to flow every time i think about it. the most disappointing thing is that i do not have any proof or film footage.  all i know for sure is that it was real, and  nobody could convince me that that craft was from this earth.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

bedroom and found that i could'nt move. i became frightened and passed out. i woke up on top of a cold table. the lighting above the table was white however i looked around and the lighting in the rest of the room was green. i saw what i would now describe as a grey alien,the lighting made this alien apprear green. when this alien saw me looking at him he just looked at me and made my head feel like it was being crushed,i passed out again. when i came to i was so terrified that i played dead and witnessed them scweesing the back of my right arm. all these years i have lived with lump in my arm. over the years i've been abducted three other times. this is what i have learned, stay in densely populated areas. the last time i was abducted i was in tahoe national forest. i was camping with my brother and best friend. we were in our tent,we were talking. i said to them,look at the green lights,can you see them? neither one of them said anything. i knew they could'nt be asleep. i blacked out only to awaken back on this table again. i believe that one of these implants is some sort of tracking device. i would really like to have this device removed. i saw this ufo on our farm once, it looked translucent it reminded me of predator charactor in that arnold shwartenegger movie. i ran to get my mother,when we returned it was gone. as a child i referred to these creatures as green

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of may 20th i was traveling home from dinner going to the city of manassas via the prince william parkway. it had rained slightly a little but had pretty much stopped. there were some light thin clouds out but nothing heavy. the traffic was very light. as i approached the city i noticed 2 or 3 airplanes traveling from the west toward the ne probably to dulles airport some distance away. it was easy to see them as it was dusk out and the sun had almost gone down but it was not dark yet. i noticed the moon rising to my left from the tree line and also the north star above the moon popped out. as i drove on i notice a glinting motion in the sky sort of flittering back and forth from the ne toward the nw. the glinting motion was kind of broken up or seemed patchy. it wasn't real fast but fast enough to notice. it sort of looked like just more stars showing up in the sky. after 2 or 3 minutes the glinting light seemed to show more of a shape and stopped a couple times between motions. that is what really caught my attention to the point it looked very odd and out of place. i pulled over to the side of the road and stopped to see it better. it continued to move sporadically and stopped in front of the moon where i could clearly see a shape. there were no real lights that i could see on the shape but it seemed to shine on one side, almost like a reflection but i could not see anything that would shine light on it. i watched for about 5 minutes and then continued to drive but couldn't stop watching the shape as it moved around and past in front of the moon. i tried to take a few picture on my phone but it was difficult while driving so i pulled over again and watched the shape. i continued to take pictures while i was parked. i believe i was watching for total of about 20 minutes or so total. there was no sound at all but i could never really gauge how far away the object was or exactly how high in the sky. throughout my time watching the object a number of planes passed from the west moving to the ne toward dulles airport. a small plane also traveled through the area for se to nw maybe toward the manassas regional airport. it was very obvious that they were planes as i could see the lights as they approached and the sound of engines grow as they came close and subsided as they moved away. after about 20 minutes it became harder to follow the shape as it moved away from the moon and i started to lose the shape in the dark sky. after losing the shape and not seeing it for a couple minutes i continued to drive the remainder of the way home. the whole way i looked around to try to find it again but could not see it again. when i arrived home i called the non emergency phone number for the manassas police department and asked if anyone had reported strange or odd lights in the area. the woman on the phone said no she had not receive any reports but asked if i wanted a different number to call to report it and i think she said it was a mufon number. i didn't write it down as i started to feel stupid as if maybe my imagination just got carried away. i scrolled through the pictures on my phone but didn't notice anything except the moon and north stars so i thought it was just my imagination so i went to bed. the next day i could not stop thinking about it again so i looked at the pictures on my phone again and noticed in one picture i did actually get an object that is clearly not a plane, a star or the moon. the object is disc

(those that did not go) that a ufo had followed them back matching speed and staying on one side of the freeway or the other hundreds of feet off the ground. now the truth is we saw ufo's at least 4 times back in the 1970's and as it is now 40+/- years later, 2 of them were while being followed in a car.  now i believe it was this occasion that my dad set up  a small telescope in the top of one of our vehicles in our driveway facing north-east (mostly east) towards highgrove calif.  in fact i have that telescope with me right now:  focal 15x-45x40mm telescope with metal tripod.  this was not the first time that i had seen a ufo, prior times i remember them being glowing objects like a fluorescent bulb, i knew there was structure but my eyes could not see beyond the glow.  i went out the front door to the telescope by my self a few minutes after they had come in, around 11pm.  i could see it about an inch wide in my view thru the telescope.  it was aspirin shaped with a dome on top. i could see a metalic grey structure thru its glowing halo.  the thing that struck me the most was how thru the telescope i could see running lights moving/spinning around the bottom (right to left) but neither the true shape nor the lights were visible without the telescope.  there were at least 3 different colored lights all next to each other so they spun as a group and were square or rectangular not round.\r\n\r\nthe other time i'm writing about is our experiences at hunter park (now hunter hobby park).  located on iowa avenue between columbia avenue and marlboro avenue in riverside calif.  we'd go there to play football, frisbee, fly kites and ride the small train.  one time i clearly remember is flying a kite and spending more time paying attention to a ufo hanging out over the bad lands straight east of the park.  the bad lands run between redlands and yucaipa one one side and what is now moreno valley on the other.  this ufo was cigar shaped and was constantly doing acrobat x.  it would stay in one place where is like a cigar horizontally laying down but then would constantly flip up or flip down on one side or the other.  we were miles away and it was thousands of feet in the air so we can see it making major moves in distance as well.  for one moment it would be in 1 spot doing its acrobat x and then it would like move in a blur you knew it moved, at times a few miles and there it was again at a full stop just a second or two later doing its acrobat x.  in retrospect i believe it was watchin march afb.  march at the time was a military airlift command base with b-52's probably nuclear ready bombers at the time.  what i saw it do what we saw it do is well beyond anything i believe we can still do today.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

intelligence by saying a certain name over the phone. i was just sitting at the kitchen table of the residence i used to live and i was talking to a friend. what makes this encounter stranger is the fact that we were talking about religion, spirituality, extraterrestrials and my friend expressed to me that she thought that a worm hole could be something in a persons mind, not necessarily in space. while having this conversation the kitchen phone rings, it is another friend that is wondering if i could come pick her up from school. while talking to her i am talking in a slightly altered voice just trying to joke around. she tells me to stop joking around that she knows its me and i reply back with \"no, i am lucifer\". after i say this i hear a strange noise in the phone and the line disconnects. as soon as i lose the call my friend i was having the multiple topic debate with instantly shows me the new tattoo she had gotten on her neck/shoulder area. it was an upside down pisces fish that also resembled a rabbits head. instantly i thought of the movie the matrix, because of neo following the white rabbit. this event is strange to because i have been perplexed with the movie the matrix and also wondering what exactly the real matrix is and also why the world works the way it does. the following few weeks i was encountered and communicated with a being that shortly discussed the existence of the human race and in the same conversation instantly flipped the script and wondered what i was doing in its territory. it had the capability to shift to other people and speak through them, or either somehow alter what i was hearing. since the incident i have had strange side effects such as extreme pressure in my head, almost like it is radiating. crazy throbbing in my feet, almost like something is moving around or radiating in them. the strangest effect though has been with my eyes, it seems since i heard the noise in the phone it made colors more vibrant and lights way more illuminated. the entity was only around for about 2 weeks, but the physical side effects have remained. i don't know really what happened or what i was talking to, but it has really affected me psychologically because i don't know why i was contacted. it seems that it was predestined for the encounter to happen though. i say that because if that exact friend wasn't there on that exact day, when i had that exact phone call and i said that specific name, and she showed me that kind of astrological/spiritual tattoo. its just really overwhelming and i don't know why it happened to me. to be honest it has been driving me crazy and i just want some help from some like minded individuals that could possibly give me some insight on what exactly happened, or at least attempt to. the past few months have been a very frustrating and lonely time for me because this type of event is so overwhelmingly out of the ordinary. it just doesn't compute with normal everyday reality and has made it really hard for me to be normal because this event was so weird and mind boggling. i appreciate you taking the time to analyze my story and i hope to hear back from you soon,

crossed my driveway, above the treeline in the eastern sky i saw a classic ufo, silver, with dome on the top, and lights around the rim.  no sound came from it.  but there was some vibration which made me stop in the driveway to look up.  i made eye contact with it and stared at it for about 10-20 seconds, realizing it wasn't an airplane.  when, in my mind, i thought, \"oh my god it's a ufo with aliens!\"  somehow, it knew what i was thinking.  it quickly moved a few feet north and in an instant it was gone, traveling south.  i ran inside and told my mother, who of course, didn't believe me.  within minutes, the air national guard was flying over the area, not in typical formation, as they usually did on sundays.  i called my mother outside and she witnessed the fighter jets flying outside their typical drill formation.  i said, \"see, i told you i saw a ufo.\"  the next day, in one of the local papers: either the journal inquirer or the hartford courant or the thrifty reminder, there was an article about the sightings.  it stated that others nearby at southwest park (now veteran's park) saw it too. i showed the article to my mother and she told me to never tell anyone or i would be sent to looney bin.  i found out later, that one of the park witnesses was my baby sitter.  we talked about it later and learned we saw the same ufo.  \r\n\r\nfact - there was an article in the paper about the ufo sightings and the air national guard was patrolling the area immediately after i saw the ufo.\r\n\r\ni saw hangar 1 episode recently about a sighting in long island and it looked just like the drawing.  i have no other evidence and would like to know if others have reported it, if you have the article or pictures of it.  \r\n\r\ni don't remember the exact date, but it was the summer time, school was out, and i was about 7-9 years old which was between 1978-1980.  i believe it was 1979. i vaguely recall thinking the ufo sighting was the same year as the f4 tornado that ripped through bradley airport a few months later on october 3, 1979.  my brother and i stilled lived in the same house and were running home from school when the tornado struck at 2:50 p.M.  as adults we both have suffered ptsd from that experience.  \r\n\r\nalso, back in the 1990's when there was a barnes and noble on hazard avenue, in enfield ct....I was in line with my step-daughter telling her about my ufo experience and man overheard my story.  he handed me his business card.  i forgot his name and misplaced the card, but he was from mufon.  again, i never reported it because i was afraid of the stigma, but with your new show on tv....I'm so curious to know if anyone else reported it, if you have pictures of the ufo i saw, if you can locate the newspaper articles, or have airport/national guard records that prove what i saw was a real ufo.  i still live in town and the house still exists where i saw the ufo and can bring you to the exact location.\r\n\r\nalso, my friend took a picture of me on my wedding day, february 20, 2010 in tavares, fl on lake dora looking south and she took a picture of what looks like a purple orb.  but it's disk shaped and appears to be large...And moving.   the date on the camera is incorrect, it was my 75 year old friend/neighbor who took the photo so she didn't know how to change the date, so i'll attach another photo that proves it was taken on saturday, february 20, 2010, 10:55:38 am.  so the pictures were taken with two different cameras.  i was just wondering if it is a ufo and if anyone else reported seeing it.","distance":"21-100

stop sign with walmart in view across the highway. i was in the front passenger seat. a clump of white lights first thought to be a plane rapidly came from the northwest, as it did its lights spread out to take up most of the sky in front of us. it came to a stop and hovered about 35 to 45* in the horizon. it was amazing, it seemed to have the appearance of a major downtown city on the top with countless white lights small an large. the bottom seemed circular in shape but void of most lights except the center, which had 3 white lights spaced evenly apart in its own center circle. this center circle's 3 bright lights were larger than any other lights any were else on the ship, and if you connected them with a line they would make a triangle. also the giant spacecraft's \"city of lights\" on top or the bottom never changed direction, only the center circle with the 3 huge white lights on the bottom center rotated.If you would have marked an arrow on this center circle on the bottom with the 3 lights at the direction in which it came from out of the northwest, when this center circle stopped after it rotated clockwise 90* this imaginary arrow would have been pointing northeast in the direction it left.When it left it left rapidly were all the lights came back together to a small cluster in the distance just like it appeared when first saw, the only differance is the small cluster of lights shot out of the atmosphere first burning bright then fading out to space just like a shooting star only in reverse. the entire time of the event; were those people in india has a red

observatory) to do some stargazing/astrophotography. as soon as i stepped out of my vehicle, the object caught my eye to the east. i initially thought it was a meteor, but immediately noticed it was moving much more slowly, and at a noticeably lower altitude, than any meteor i had seen. it looked to be at the same altitude as most cruising aircraft (~30,000 ft.) but traveled about 80 degrees from east to north-north east in about 5 seconds. when the sighting started, the object was about 40 degrees above the horizon, almost directly east, and i was able to follow it, as it traveled in a straight line, until it disappeared over the horizon, to the north-north east. the object appeared to have a leading edge, either a circular arc, or an obtuse rounded delta shape, with the trailing edge obscured by the trail/exhaust. the object glowed a very soft white/gray, and looked about twice the size of a 747 at 30,000 ft (which would make it about 400 ft. across at estimated altitude). the object emitted a dimmer, white/gray, patterned trail about 3 degrees long, and 1/4 degree thick, that tapered and dissipated quickly as the object traveled. the trail appeared to emanate in an alternating fashion, from the left and right side of the object in rapid succession (about every 1/6th second), leaving a trail of a corresponding, alternating pattern, during the entire sighting. i could see no red or green navigation lights common to aircraft. after the sighting i stood, somewhat in shock, staring at the spot where the object disappeared over the horizon. i looked around the sky for a few minutes, hoping to maybe see something similar, but didn't. i resumed setting up my telescopes and beginning long exposures, as the timed exposures were taking place i watched the skies. aircraft were passing overhead, in common fashion, taking about 30 to 45 seconds to cover the same perceived distance as the object seen earlier. other aircraft could be seen in the landing patterns of lax and burbank airports, all looking nothing like the object seen. satellites of different brightnesses and speeds could be seen till sunrise, all appearing nothing like the object. i observed about 15 meteors over the course of 3 hours, with the longest lasting taking less than 2 seconds to cover 90 degrees, none leaving trails like the object, or appearing so low. i've been an amateur astronomer for over 20 years, and have not seen anything similar to this before.","distance":"Over One

Base","country":"DE","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Living in air force base housing on ramstein air base in feb 2005. my baby was asleep. my husband was working the night shift on the flight line. he was responsible for putting fuel into airplanes. i went to bed around 2am and fell asleep. i woke up in my bed at 6am and immediately recalled the following and as the morning progressed, the details formed more clearly in my memory:\r\n\r\ni was high above the flightline in some sort of flying canoe. there were dozens of other flying canoes with 2 people and an alien in each canoe. \r\n\r\nwe were all floating away from a gigantic mother ship. it was behind me and/or to my right. it was a saucer-shaped craft with a row of lights all around the perimeter, i don't remember if the lights were colorful or just white. \r\n\r\nin my canoe i was with an alien and a human man. i sensed the alien was a female because telepathically she was communicating love, comfort, and protection for me and the man. the man was in the same circumstance i was in. we both felt safe and happy.\r\n\r\nthe alien was sitting in front of me, and the man was sitting behind me. but i was turned looking to my right, so really the alien was on my left and the man was on my right. we were up in the air, i could see the tops of 1-story buildings along the flightline. it was in the middle of the night, so more than i remember seeing rooftops, i remember seeing lights on the buildings, and the bright lights of the flightline, and the lights of the mothership illuminating everything.\r\n\r\nwe were quiet, calm, content, and although i have no recollection of what happened before that moment in the canoe or how we got there or why, i do clearly remember how i felt in that moment. the man and i had just shared some sort of significant experience together, and although i have no recollection, i sense that the aliens had this man & i mate for the purpose of procreation. that was the feeling i had afterwards in the canoe, a very peaceful, meaningful feeling. \r\n\r\nthe man was a stranger to me, but we'd shared a significant experience together, and even though i intuitively knew we'd never see each other again, it was ok because we had served our purpose and we were at peace, no need for a typical human bond. \r\n\r\nthat's literally all i remember, a period of about 10 seconds, sitting in that \"canoe,\" observing everything around me and feeling at peace.\r\n\r\nnext thing i remember i woke up at home in my bed at 6am. i was well-rested, unharmed, feeling fine. perhaps it was a dream? it sure didn't feel anything like a dream. i've never had any such dream in my life before or since.\r\n\r\nwhen my husband came home that morning, he mentioned that on his way to the car on his way to work the night before, he noticed that anyone outside at that time was looking up into the sky. so he looked up in the sky too, and he saw a cluster or a triangle of round lights below the clouds, above the rooftops. he drove the mile or two to work, and everyone he saw was looking up in the sky. when he got to work he looked up and the lights were still there. then he had to go into work indoors. the next time he went outside he said the lights were still there. then back indoors. next time he went out, the lights were gone. he's not much of a talker, so he never mentioned if he talked to his co-workers about it too.\r\n\r\nabout a month or two later the ramstein air force base newspaper wrote an article about it. probably because so many people were talking about it and wanting an explanation. the newspaper article acknowledged that there were indeed unusual lights in the sky that february night but they passed it off as something explainable and non-newsworthy.\r\n\r\nhmm.\r\n\r\ni see we have the ability here to upload pictures along with our report. i'm no artist at all but this is the first time i've even thought about drawing what i saw. perhaps i'll seek an artist who can render my description better. the most remarkable aspect of what i saw were the dimensions and height from which i observed everything below. \r\n\r\ni discovered this mufon website a couple weeks ago. thankfully i still recall that february night 10 years ago very clearly.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less,

perhaps some type of military driod. i spoke out loud and told it if it is friendly i would talk, if it is unfriendly to leave now. it had 2 grey bars like an upside down plug. from these a wing would extend out within the orb. the pulses were 1 per second. how i lost time i do not know. i remember putting my car into drive and driving through yankten and the orb fell behind and followed me crossing the street a few times and hovering in the trees. south of yankten the bright orb met up with a peach coloured orb about 10 feet away from it, stayed there for awhile,then they both left. the next evening i went out with some people on a hill overlooking pickstown, south of yankten and they recorded 21 orange orbs. i did not know this was going on. i was going to greenwood to do honor
