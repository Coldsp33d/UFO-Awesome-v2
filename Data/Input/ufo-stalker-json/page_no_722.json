columbia, canada in early may 2015. i have always enjoyed star gazing and love it when i happen to see a satellite or a shooting star, both with very distinctive movements in that they travel in straight lines with no suggestion of intelligent control. they're predictable, in other words. \r\n\r\nwhile standing on a dock in complete darkness i looked up and noticed a very bright 'star' in the sky north of me at about 45 degrees up from the horizon. after only watching it for less than a minute it became brighter as if coming toward me like a completely silent helicopter with a front facing light before it suddenly turned east and travelled at a consistent speed before the light disappeared.\r\n\r\nthis incident was a little odd but not jaw dropping and i've seen enough aircraft or helicopters with such lights over the years to explain it away as a turning aircraft i couldn't hear. so i continued to look up and only a matter of minutes later i saw another 'star' that was brighter than most in the western sky. there were no clouds in the sky and from where my camp was located, no sound either.\r\n\r\nafter watching it for a minute or two, the object suddenly began to slowly rise straight up. i did a bit of a head shake when it started moving, but told myself i must have been mistaken and it was a satellite and had likely been moving the entire time. then it began to...Meander...How else can i describe it? it started to meander up the sky like a bug wandering along on a car windshield. for about a minute or more it moved on purpose in a non-linear manner up the sky before simply disappearing into thin air. \r\n\r\nmeteors and other objects entering earth's atmosphere have a clearly defined trajectories as do satellites. yes, the iss and satellites disappear behind clouds but they don't go out like a light switch, they don't stay absolutely still in the sky and they definitely don't deviate from the path they are on as if operating with some form of intelligence.\r\n\r\nthat one made me say 'huh?!' but with no physical evidence or witnesses what can i do, so i chalked it up to a one-time freaky experience. then, while at work last week, in the end of may 2015 i saw it again, twice in the same night!!\r\n\r\ni was working at night at approximately 10:45 pm and was chatting with a co-worker when i looked up to see a 'star' moving diagonally from south to north across the clear sky. i made an exclamation and began to tell my coworker about the object i had seen while camping earlier in the month, when this object also began to meander in the same manner i had seen before! as i watched the object move in an intelligent way i urged my coworker to get his binoculars which he had in his car. when he did he did he said it looked like a red snake in the sky. i asked him to give me the binoculars so i could see it but when i reached for them and looked back, the object had simply vanished!\r\n\r\nwe were both like 'whoa' but didn't say much more about it after it disappeared. but after he had gone i happened to look up in the eastern sky directly opposite to where my coworker and i had seen the moving object to see a similar star-like object meander it's way down the sky, wobbling in the same way all the way below the horizon out of sight.\r\n\r\nso for a second time in a month i saw the same type of star-like object meandering in the sky like no movement from any terrestrial aircraft i have ever seen. so i decided to google search terms like 'moving lights in the sky' and 'glowing orb in the sky' and 'moving stars' only to find videos of the exact thing i had seen! exactly like stars but they move like they are alive. simple as that.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

student accommodation. i was there about a month. it was on a weekend that this event took place, and i was the only one in the apartment block who hadn't gone home for the weekend. i went out to the back garden for a cigarette and i looked up in the sky and there were a number of crafts in the sky. i counted four of them and as i looked up to my left there was another that was like the shape of a traffic cone that shot past like a shooting star. when it had passed three parallel shooting star-like objects shot through the sky at right angles to the flight path. i sat on the ground to the right at a fuel tank and smoked a cigarette. to the right of where i saw the traffic cone craft there was a silver craft which was how i describe as the shape of a modern set of bathroom scales or something, oval, and curved in the middle. it was silver and there was a bright light at the front. from where i was i could only see the bottom of this one. it was stationery in the sky and there was no indication of any propellers or anything holding it there. to the left of this one there was one that was more like a typical \"flying saucer\" - it was round and silver with a bit, like a bubble. on the top. it was spinning. to the right of this, on the other half of the sky, there was a cigar/cylinder looking craft. my memory of this one is the most unclear of the five, but it had lights on it also. below this one there was another saucer shaped craft. it was black and there were red and yellow lights that ran along the outside of it. it appeared to be just above the roofs of terraced houses that i could see from where i was standing. this craft was spinning, but it was also wobbling from side to side, a bit like a spinning top.\r\nnone of these objects made any noise. when i saw them at first i knew they were like nothing i'd seen in the skies before. unfortunately i didn't have my iphone on me. my initial feeling was one of peace and a sort of inner understanding. but as i sat out for a little longer and finished smoking my cigarette it began to register with me that this was absolutely not a normal experience, so i returned inside the building, leaving the four remaining objects in the sky behind me. i did this as although i have quite a big interest in ufo's and extra-terrestrials, at that time i did not want to be abducted.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

with hedgerows commonly found in the uk). \r\nas we passed the air force base on the left of the road entering the \"lanes\" car heading aprox nw there is a field which is surrounded by hedgerows, i could not describe the size of this field as i do no longer live in the uk, but it is larger than 100m2 from memory.\r\n in the field there was a gigantic object which was not a farming vehicle, not a plane or helecopter.\r\nthe filed was designed to hold livestock so it wasn't a combine harvester which some people may have suggested. \r\nthe object was the width of the field, measuring aprox 5m high (floating, hovering, stationary) off the ground aprox 5-10m.\r\nit appeared to be matt white, and there where very bright spotlights coming out at various angles, the object was shaped like a typical dimond jewel shape, upturned  with the point cut off flat edge down.\r\nthere where no military personal around, which is surprising considering that it was not even 1km away from one of the largest raf base in the uk. \r\n\r\ni have always wondered what this object could have been, there was no other sightings recorded or documented in the area of where my friends and i had seen it.

this paper...\r\n\r\nare there extraterrestrials in lincoln hills?\r\n\r\nat approximately 11:00 pm on saturday, may 30, while i was walking my dog along perdita lane, i suddenly noticed in the western sky two luminous objects shaped like some kind of giant stationary birds with wide wingspans. neither of these objects appeared to move, although one was apparently higher than the other because of a clear difference in light intensity. fascinated and, frankly, a bit apprehensive about these strange objects, the next morning i drove out to the area where i thought these objects might have been hovering. sure enough, i found two specific locations on the 3rd and 4th fairways where patches of grass had been burned in distinct circular shapes, each patch approximately 6-to-10 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nspecifically, these two locations were at the northeast corner of the intersection between del web boulevard and farmgate lane and at the golf cart crossing on rose bouquet lane. apparently someone had already marked these spots with white spray paint. my next step was to call a friend of mine whose career as a federal government investigator gives him much insight into dod surveillance strategies. he told me he too had seen these aerial nocturnal objects over lincoln hills. he said they might be drones sent out as test vehicles from beale air force base, which is about 8 miles east of marysville. \r\n\r\nso what do you think? are we being invaded by extraterrestrials, or is our federal government now using our lincoln hills community as a testing ground for the next

the inside of house. while outside, i stargaze and look at the sky. my porch is a second story balcony that is roofed, with a lip across the top, to hang plants or birdfeeders. it faces due north.I sit in a rocker to smoke, sometimes for 30-45 minutes at a time.During the several months prior to my weird experience, i noticed that there was a light far away star at about ten o'clock to where i sat and above the tree line a good distance. it was a very small feint star that would move towards the horizon, the later it was in the evening, until it disappeared behind the tree line. at least four times, during my several months, i would see a single pinpoint light flash right by that star. it would blink brightly, once and then twice, a couple of times that i saw it. i thought at first that i was seeing things until i purposely watched that star. between 9-11pm timeframe, i would catch it flash at the same place, once, sometimes twice, then wouldn't flash again. i thought this was odd, but didn't think it was anything extraordinary. my 71 year old mother sits in her recliner beside the glass doors that lead to my porch where i smoke. one night i asked my mom to come and see if it would light again, because i would see it out of the corner of my eye, flash. she came out and did, indeed, see it flash once. she made a little fun of me \"watching for the aliens\". i passed this off and kept going out nightly for my smoke and stargaze. i have no idea if my experience and my mom's experience on june 28, 2015, had anything to do with this. i just felt that it was odd, as the light flashed at the same place, when i would catch it blink, and then go out or blink once more, maybe a couple of minutes later. it wouldn't move like a plane on a path, or blink consistently like a tower. the star was too high to b close to a tower, anyway.\r\non the night of june 28, 2015, around 10-11:30 pm, i was outside smoking. my mom was in her chair and the glass door to the patio was open so we could talk to eachother thru the open door and we could see eachother through the glass separating the patio. i was rocking in my chair and saw a light, the size of a grapefruit appear on the top ledge where the plant hooks are. it was confusing to me, because it was a definite shaped light, like a flashlight beam, but could have only come from inside the apartment, due to the angle of the light. i said to my mom, you're going to think i'm crazy, but i just saw a round light on the plant hook up there\". i then looked around to her, through the glass. she got wide eyed stating that she just witnessed the light flash after i said that i saw it. she said it was round and \"about this big\", making a round circle with both hands, about the size of a grapefruit too. she said \"really, i just saw it too, it was right up there over the hook\". i started to look into the apartment for anything that could have caused a reflective light. due to the lip of the edge of the roof, coming down, there is no physical way that the light originated from anywhere but inside the house and uphigh. the porch, because it was night, was dark enough, even with the curtains open, to see the light very clearly, as a separate light source from any other light that we had. at that point, my mom got out of her chair. she stepped outside on the deck and we were both standing with our arms on the railing, looking out at the stars, when an extremely bright white light came on, like someone had flipped a switch. it was about 45 degrees.....I'm doing an educated guess because i'm not that good at degrees.....It was a good ways above the tree line but not looking straight up. it was about half way between looking straight up in the sky, and the tree line. this bright white solid, unblinking light, just appeared from nowhere, not a sound. it was like a spotlight on a helicopter, but there was no craft, just the solid circle of bright light. while i was seeing it, it seemed like it was much closer than it had to have been. the light was high up, but the light seemed close to us. i know it sounds odd and i don't understand this myself. it had to have been up at least helicopter level, because i could see an object the second time it flashed.... i will get to that momentarily. what i'm saying is that it was up pretty high, but seemed to be much closer to us. we both had an odd feeling after the sighting, which i will explain as best as possible, later. the first very bright light came on, silently, and stayed on for about five seconds....It seemed longer than that....Then the light went completely out. it flashed on again, once and very bright, about a quarter the way across the sky. the night was very clear, so it didn't go behind a cloud. the second time it came on, it stayed on for 4 seconds , no sound. when it flashed off, i saw a dark object that looked like a cigar. it was a split second that i saw it and it was then gone and lighting up at theanother point straight ahead, continuing to go east, in a straight line. when it lit up, it seemed to be stationary. it lit up the second time going east, it went out and i saw a cigar shaped object.....Then it lit up in the next point, going east....About the same distance from the first blink to the second and from the second to the third. the third time it lit up, silently and stationary, it looked as if whatever it was, was lit up from the inside. it looked just like seeing a car door opened at night, with the interior light on.....Not the shape, just the lighting tone. it was far enough that i didn't see a craft, but saw what looked like the inside of a craft lit up, dimly. it lasted from 4-5 seconds and then was gone. both my mom and i were quite confused at what we had just seen. there was no sound, three times of lighting up, with the third being dimmer and from the inside, then it was gone.  we both agreed that that was something that we had never seen before and we were both a little confused. shortly thereafter, an extremely low plane, of which i had not seen before in the sky, went over our apartments from southwest to northeast, the same direction as the flashing cigar. the plane was very loud and had three rows of lights on its belly, with the middle row of lights being much longer than the ones beside it.....Like the long row of lights were along the tail to the nose and a row of lights on each side starting at the same point at the tail, but only going half way up the longer body line of lights. we had never seen a plane go so low over us and the belly was lit so bright with three lines of lights. i am not sure how long it was after the flashing lights disappeared, until the loud plane came over. it had to have been within 20 minutes, because we didn't stay out that much longer on the deck, after the flashing lights. we came in and went to our own rooms. about an hour later, i asked my mom \"ok, don't laugh at me when i ask, but did you get the feeling that whatever that was, wanted us to see it and was aware of us?\"  she replied that indeed she had the same feeling. it was as if the lights were high in the sky, but much closer to us. i'm sorry for this weird feeling. i'm not a crazy person and i've never had any experience before. in hindsight, it felt as if whatever it was wanted my mom and i to see them. i have sat outside, every night since, but have seen nothing. there are lots of planes that go over. you can hear them and see their red and white lights blinking, near and far. this was no plane. it was very very bright, silent and fast.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

the inside of house. while outside, i stargaze and look at the sky. my porch is a second story balcony that is roofed, with a lip across the top, to hang plants or birdfeeders. it faces due north.I sit in a rocker to smoke, sometimes for 30-45 minutes at a time.During the several months prior to my weird experience, i noticed that there was a light far away star at about ten o'clock to where i sat and above the tree line a good distance. it was a very small feint star that would move towards the horizon, the later it was in the evening, until it disappeared behind the tree line. at least four times, during my several months, i would see a single pinpoint light flash right by that star. it would blink brightly, once and then twice, a couple of times that i saw it. i thought at first that i was seeing things until i purposely watched that star. between 9-11pm timeframe, i would catch it flash at the same place, once, sometimes twice, then wouldn't flash again. i thought this was odd, but didn't think it was anything extraordinary. my 71 year old mother sits in her recliner beside the glass doors that lead to my porch where i smoke. one night i asked my mom to come and see if it would light again, because i would see it out of the corner of my eye, flash. she came out and did, indeed, see it flash once. she made a little fun of me \"watching for the aliens\". i passed this off and kept going out nightly for my smoke and stargaze. i have no idea if my experience and my mom's experience on june 28, 2015, had anything to do with this. i just felt that it was odd, as the light flashed at the same place, when i would catch it blink, and then go out or blink once more, maybe a couple of minutes later. it wouldn't move like a plane on a path, or blink consistently like a tower. the star was too high to b close to a tower, anyway.\r\non the night of june 28, 2015, around 10-11:30 pm, i was outside smoking. my mom was in her chair and the glass door to the patio was open so we could talk to eachother thru the open door and we could see eachother through the glass separating the patio. i was rocking in my chair and saw a light, the size of a grapefruit appear on the top ledge where the plant hooks are. it was confusing to me, because it was a definite shaped light, like a flashlight beam, but could have only come from inside the apartment, due to the angle of the light. i said to my mom, you're going to think i'm crazy, but i just saw a round light on the plant hook up there\". i then looked around to her, through the glass. she got wide eyed stating that she just witnessed the light flash after i said that i saw it. she said it was round and \"about this big\", making a round circle with both hands, about the size of a grapefruit too. she said

year rather than fight the crowds and had just put the kids to bed.  it was overcast and foggy that night, so i stepped outside and happened to look to the northeast toward thornton (i live in south-central denver) and thought, \"boy, that's an odd color for a helicopter running light.\"  i saw a solid, stationary blue-green light about 30 degrees above the horizon below the cloud cover.  it was not strobing or flickering like a landing or running light from a helicopter or airplane, nor was there any sound coming from the object i could tell.  i estimated it was around 3 to 5 miles from me, so i found that odd as even on a night where fireworks are going off i should have been able to hear something, especially considering it was below the cloud cover.\r\n\r\nas i watched, the light faded, slowly at first but then picking up in speed until it went out entirely.  at that point i figured it was probably just a very bright flare or firework that got hung in a thermal or something, and was about to turn around and go back inside when it reappeared in the same position.  however, it had changed color from bluish-green to bright red.  so bright it almost hurt to look at.  it then started to slowly move horizontally in the sky to my position, and that's when i called my wife outside to look, as well.  \r\n\r\nit did this another two or three times, fading out and then coming back alternating between blue-green and red, all the while either remaining absolutely stationary or tracking a few degrees horizontally, for about a minute.  then, it dimmed somewhat and shot off to the north in the general direction of greeley where i lost sight of it behind the neighbor's trees.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what that object was, but i do believe there was an object emitting that light.  when it dimmed, i could make out a faint outline of...Something.  there was a physical object behind this.  what it was, i can't say.  but i can most certainly tell you what it was not:\r\n\r\n• it was not a helicopter; there was no noise nor did it move or accelerate in any manner a helicopter could.  when it took off i would estimate it went from stationary to about 250-300 knots or faster in a matter of a few seconds.\r\n\r\n• it was not an airplane; airplanes cannot hang in the sky like that and, besides, i would have heard either a turboprop or turbofan engine.  i grew up just up the road from davis monthan afb, and have seen my share of both civilian and military aircraft.  it was not a jetliner, nor was it a c-130, c-5, a-10, f-15, f-16, or f-18.  we get a lot of civilian traffic coming over our house from both dia and smaller aircraft from centennial airport, so if it was a plane from either of those, or from buckley afb, i would have recognized it by sound.\r\n\r\n• it was not fireworks.  unless, of course, someone has invented a firework capable of holding position, changing colors multiple times slowly, and able to propel itself along faster than most wwii fighter planes could.\r\n\r\n• it was not a flare.  see above.\r\n\r\n• it was not jumpers parachuting into any of the fireworks shows around town with sparklers on their suits.  at 10:15, all of the major shows had already ended.  additionally, i've seen them jump into shows before.  see flares above. \r\n\r\nas i said, my wife saw this as well, but chalked it up to being a helicopter or drone.  at least i know i'm not crazy, however.  i did give a drone some thought, as an aside, but discarded it for the above reasons regarding traditional aircraft.  it was, for all intents and purposes, a classic ufo.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

could tell and know it was neither things. the object pulsated in a way and i told my husband and daughter to look, we all joked it was a ufo and then after a few moments of laughing, we looked back to the clearing of the trees to see it and it was gone. reading all these other sightings all over the us, we wanted to share our story, we feel weird now! we're wondering if they could see us
