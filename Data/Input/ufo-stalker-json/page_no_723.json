sitting down to july 4th dinner on pool patio out back. time was around 8:10 pm. sky clear blue with very small, very few low scattered clouds. father saw bright round object stationary almost directly overhead. i quickly recognized that this wasn't a plane or meteor. i ran into house to get sony handycam to film and called my wife, stepmother and daughter's boyfriend outside to witness.\r\n\r\nobject still overhead but slowly moving after 5 stationary minutes.  moved in a east se to a north nw direction. object distance seemed very high and higher than passenger jets with jetstreams.  filming was shaky as it was hand held with some filming with my arms on table for some support object distance was very high which made filming seem more shaky.  2nd problem was that its a new camera and i was not familiar with the auto focus and how to turn it off while i filmed and fought trying to manually focus.\r\n\r\nobject was stationary overhead for 5 minutes and then traveled for 20-25 minutes spanning from 90 degrees overhead to about 45 degrees from horizon with occasional wispy clouds but mostly blue sky as film will show. i did put the camera down once to view through my night optics goggles which wasn't very successful in the light.  picking back up the handycam, the object was still in the sky and then i got the suprise that my daughter could visually see.  please excuse the couple of curse words i said in my excitement in the film.\r\n\r\nobject then seemed to release a smaller object around the 8 oclock position, that i was able to view, go out and up visually.  i then looked back in my view finder to see 2 more objects coming down out of the emission and the lower one then separated into 2.  after i lost sight in my camera screen of the objects i looked up and they were not visible  however i saw a dark jet flying about 2000 ft up but in the distance and could not hear the engines but did not record it as i remained searching for the objects.   film is condensed as i edited out the very shaky and blurred parts.  i checked and there were no rocket launches from wallops island or canaveral nor could i find any high altitude balloon launches recently either.  your thoughts would be appreciated.  total sighting lasted 35 minutes approximately.","distance":"Over One

alignment of venus and ?(another planet),however the objects we were looking at were too large to be stars. further, they were located in northern sky (i think the alignment was to be seen in the west?). we could also tell the objects were definitely not part of the fireworks display. \r\n     to the left of the fireworks was a stationary (hovering?) horizontal rectangle with lights rapidly skipping across it. the movement of the lights seemed random. the colors were predominately orange and yellow and a bright white and maybe a dark color in between. to the left of this ufo was a smaller orb, more rounded in shape and its color was a dull red. when i first saw them, both objects were stationary and they remained so for about five minutes. \r\n     i suggested my daughter get her phone and take a picture. when she went inside, the objects began a slow movement to the left (west). they were still moving west when she returned. she was unable to get a photo and went back inside for her ipad. she returned and was still unable to get a picture. both objects were still slowly moving west. the smaller object appeared to fade out after a few moments. perhaps it went behind a cloud and the larger object followed it and disappeared.\r\n     initially, we both thought they might be helicopters, but they didn't look right. my daughter called the police station to see if any

through the celestial part of air force navigator training. one night, i was taking practice celestial shots. the exact date escapes me, but it was in july well before the soviets had launched sputnik.\r\n\r\nthere were celestial navigation trainers in the paved quadrangle, small enclosures with astrodomes on them. each cadet would hang a sextant from an astrodome. the sextant for use in an aircraft must have an artificial horizon because inside an aircraft there is no actual horizon except that in the cockpit. a bubble was needed to create the artificial horizon in the manner of a carpenter's level, so an aerial sextant was usually referred to as a \"bubble sextant\". because aircraft that are flying are usually bouncing or careening slightly during a celestial shot, these sextants have averagers built into them. one puts the crosshairs of the sextant on a star that appears to be inside the bubble and uses a little dial to keep the crosshairs on the star for two minutes in which the averager is doing its job.\r\n\r\nprior to taking each shot, the student navigator must precompute the elevation and azimuth of the star he wishes to shoot. these figures are used to aim the sextant in the precise direction and elevation for the star. so when the student looks into the sextant eyepiece, he sees a field of view in which there should be one star that is brighter than the others in the field. he then assumes that he has the correct star to shoot and sets the sextant crosshairs on that star.\r\n\r\nthat night my first shot was to be on kochab, the 2.2 magnitude star at the lip of the little dipper (ursa minor). i made my precomps inside the dorm and went out to the navigation trainer with a flashlight and my precomps. there were two other cadets in the trainer doing their precomps by flashlight while i put the sextant up and set the azimuth and elevation.\r\n\r\nwhen i put my eye on the sextant eyepiece, there was a bright star in the field just as there should be, so i waited until the precise time for the shot according to my precomp. i began the shot and was adjusting the elevation as the averager was ticking away. the \"star\" i was shooting held firm with other stars in the field for about half a minute. then i noticed that the azimuth and elevation were changing in excess of what was usual and could see that the supposed star was changing location relative to the other stars in the field. i took my eye from the eyepiece and watched the \"star\" slowly moving to the right and slightly downward in relation to the other stars.\r\n\r\nthe two other cadets in the trainer were still precomputing for a shot. i tried to show them the \"star\", but they could not easily see it among the other stars and it was moving too slowly for them to notice it easily - so they lost interest quickly and never saw what i was attempting to show them. i was not excited because nothing exciting seemed to be happening. consequently, the other cadets went back to what they had been doing.\r\n\r\ni watched the \"star\" continuing to move for a distance of about ten degrees across the sky (perhaps it was less) and then it stopped and just stayed in place with the other stars once more. i continued to watch the \"star\" for several minutes and checked its location again before i left the trainer (at least a half hour later). the object never moved again during this time relative the other stars.\r\n\r\ni thought about this for some time. i never reported it. this was before there was ever even a sputnik. later, in the air force, i learned of many ufo sightings that were never reported (reporting them was unwise at the time), and i began to think that what i had seen was a \"mother ship\" changing its solar orbit. had it been in earth orbit it would have been moving all the time. a synchronous earth orbit is possible, but not where that \"star\" was.\r\n\r\ni have a bachelor of science degree in general engineering and numerous post grad courses. i have been an air force navigator, private pilot, and engineer among other things.\r\n\r\ni would prefer that my name be kept out of this if it is published anywhere.\r\n\r\n

home. so i walked her to her car to see her off. we were standing by her car saying our goodbyes when a bright star to the east caught my eye and i said to her \"jebus that star is bright\", she thought it was one of our planets. then we both noticed a white flashing below the position of the star/planet we were looking at, moving south-east. i asked her \"whats that right there?\" and pointed. she replies \"a plane maybe?\". but the white flashing was different from the white strobe lighting on typical aircraft. the things white pulse went (flash-white pause flash-white cont.) and from what i have seen on conventional aircraft the white pulse they put off goes (flash-white twice rapid succession pause flash-white once cont.) but anyway as this thing was starting to move over head we could then make out 3 solid orange circular lights in a triangle around the pulsing white light. then as it kept coming in our direction and was almost 90 degrees off the horizon over head the pulsing light changed in color and succession red green and white now but much faster pulsing and seemingly at random intervals. i turned to her and said \"yeah, i don't think that's a plane\". so we walked up my front yard to keep watching this thing move away from us now, because the trees in my yard and neighbors we obstructing our view.\r\n\r\nall of that ^ happened within 3 or 4 minutes so the thing was moving quick.\r\n\r\nnow were standing in my yard and not in the street by her car and i am still watching this thing move to the se. then she points out to me there are two more to the sw. 1 of them was a streaking solid white light that seemed to just go out seconds after she pointed them out, and the other was another pulsing red green white randomly those colors both moving nw. i can not stress enough the seemingly random pattern of the pulsing red white and green. it was like (red red white green white red green red white) no order to them that i could tell of. so now we are watching this other pulsing move nw and behind my neighbors tree again so back into the street to watch we went. after watching this one move away to the nw for another just handful of minutes i scanned the skies behind me because my curiosity is peaked. right bloody there behind us was our original 3 pulsing colors and 3 solid circular orange lighting triangular craft. still moving as quick as before but now its also moving nw, just on my east. so now were watching this one again and as it is moving away from us. then the thing turned on a really bright cone of light that rotated 45 or 90 degrees from its right side to the front of it and then turned off. but it was so fast it was hard to tell how much the light rotated. the cone light was brighter and more prominent than the other lights but the cone light did not interrupt the pulsing or orange lights.\r\n\r\nthere is plenty more story cause we observed these things for about an hour and a half and all that above was about 20 minutes of that experience. i was thinking you guys might find this interesting and possibly look into radar and what not if you are interested. \r\n\r\n\r\nthank

hill ga, on our long road trip to colorado springs co, where i will be stationed as an active duty army senior nco. prior to leaving i bought a brand new gps navigation unit and we tested it out in town prior to our trip knowing it worked well. our navigation unit directed us toward augusta ga. our kids fell asleep at about 9pm. \r\nat precisely 01:28am 29 june 2015 on hwy 1 south heading north approximately 7-8 miles south of a gas station at 10525 hwy 1 south, wadley ga 30477. our radio began to get real static so i turned it down when my wife noticed a very large object flying left to right coming toward us. i looked up to the left and hit my brakes stopping our truck to the side of the road. the object appeared to be approximately 250 meters in length 60 meters in height and was approximately flying 200 feet in altitude and was spurting sparks from the rear of the object. the sparks were jetting out about 50-80 meters in a pattern of controlling thrust. \r\nmy wife and i had a very good look at the object closer than anyone else on that highway considering there was no vehicles in sight. the object had a dim glow of a orange around it, vague but noticeable. the objects exterior was metallic but appeared to look like oil on water effect to it and appeared to be fluid like movement over the metallic body of the object. the moon and nearby clouds gave us a good look at the body of the object. my wife and i watched in disbelief in what we were witnessing as it moved left to right the object decreased in altitude as it was over the highway and us in our truck then began to increase in altitude after it crossed the highway right overhead of us. we watched as it increased in altitude and penetrated some clouds and accelerated out of sight through the cloud cover quickly.\r\n i got back on the road and proceeded down the highway way feeling a bit shook up with a mild headache trying debunk what it might have been. too fast for a blimp but was the closest man made aircraft in comparison, too slow for airplanes, no sound but mild humming, too big to be any aircraft or helicopter, and so on. about 4-5 miles further up the road a semi truck had stopped on the side of the road on the southbound lanes and a car with a guy getting back in their car as they saw what we saw. i stopped at the first gas station on the right and told the guy there what we saw and bought a few things to proceed on our road trip. an hour later our navigation system malfunctioned telling us we were at our final destination in the middle of nowhere at a church. my wife mentioned that we have been driving 9 hours which seamed to me to be a long time for the amount distance we cover. i stopped and powered it down and reset it to colorado springs. we got back on track and we stopped to sleep in north atlanta area just after 6am. my stomach was upset and i did not sleep well nor did my wife. \r\nwe got up late afternoon and got back on the road. 6 hours after being on the road my trucks transmission began acting up and we had stopped. i messed around with changing my trucks transmission settings through all the functions for about 15 minutes and it eventually corrected itself. i have had on an off headaches and upset stomach since witnessing this object. my truck has been acting odd as well, check engine oil level, check engine, and a large chip in the windshield not noticed before.\r\ni have receipts and time lines available and i can include a drawing of the object. i am capable of drawing and painting a visual representation of what we saw but my art supplies are packed away until we find a home to buy so i’m limited as to what i can do for the time being. the image of that object is vivid in my mind to good detail so i will produce a visual reference at a later time. i’m unsure what the object was and i am not one for jumping to conclusions. i consider all possibilities and i rely on facts before assumptions. our experience is what it is, and could or could not be in relations to one another. i would rather provide more information than not enough information of the event. there is no such thing as too much information.\r\nplease keep in mind i am active duty military i’m speaking of this only because i have not yet been told not to and i have not been forced to sign non disclosure orders as i have been forced to in the past. my mos has  presented me with more than a few of incidents in similar situations. i have always had been approached and forced to sign the nondisclosure orders. if you need anything else someone needs to get here and talk to me soon.\r\nthanks!\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Patterned Surface,

throughout the years after the event, this is just another classic case of triangle sightings. low, slow and silent. read anyway when interested. :)\r\n\r\nit was on a school yard with two friends on a chilly evening in '94. we were just hanging out that night. my friends were standing directly under a light by the schools' entrance while i was standing in the middle of the (elementary) schools' square. i was having a glance at the sky because it was very bright that night. \r\ni was only looking up for minutes, maybe even seconds when something caught my attention in the right corner of my eye. the first split-second it was like a big moving dark \"blind spot\" against the stars and it was already as good as directly above me when i got my focus.\r\nto my amazement i saw this very -in my view- exotic looking triangle which immediately seemed to be in total control, unlike the fact that it seemed to be moving too slow to even stay in the air. \r\nthree dull red lights on each corner and the obvious outline of a solid triangle-shaped object.\r\nit wasn't scary but i was definitely shocked and intimidated by its \"sudden\" appearance. too close and too low. also way too silent for comfort. i can't even help but to think they must have seen me looking and pointing at them.\r\ni think it took about a total of 20 seconds before it disappeared behind the building at the end of the street i was looking into. \r\nthe way it seemed to move at that speed seemed impossible. so steady and straight. i couldn't hear any sound besides the obvious screaming of my own voice calling my friends to come and look. they came running but too late to be able to pick it up. coming directly away from under the light too i suppose. that was and still kind of is frustrating but it doesn't really matter. i have great eyesight and i like to think i am a rational person. i saw whatever i saw that night.\r\ni only told my family at first because i didn't feel like it sounded very believable, especially in those days. in 2015 for some reason it sounds more believable.\r\ni'm not even sure if my friends totally believed me. i don't doubt they believed i saw something. i just think it's easier to believe your own eyes than someone else's.\r\n\r\n\r\nin the first years after the event i was convinced that it wasn't \"ours\". it just didn't seem possible in the laws of physics as we humans know it or like in my case at that time: as i was used to seeing flying objects.\r\nnow years later i just think it is most likely ours and that we as a species are not to be underestimated in the (terrible) things we are capable of. even if it is just hiding the inevitable source of energy we are so clearly ready for. that is if we want to save our planet. \r\nand also to be the first intelligent species in the history of the universe to make it past the ten million years of existence mark. if that theory is correct.\r\n\r\nanyway, in conclusion. our town is stretched out and about 3-4 miles long. it flew over at pretty much the center of the \"long side\" at the time i saw it. around 22pm. thats why i think there must be more people around here that have seen it that evening.\r\nthat people still see them today means these triangles can \r\nalso (still) fly over us without even being seen, let alone identified.","distance":"101-500

sun was low on the western horizon.  i was staying in my camper in the trees.  after dinner, i took a cup of coffee and walked out to the main dirt road, about one hundred (100), yards away, out of the trees.  this is a fairly isolated place in the wind river mountains, about thirty (30) miles northwest of south pass, wyoming.  there are high, granite peaks to the north that stretch all the way up to yellowstone.  farson, the closest hamlet, is about sixty (60) miles to the west-southwest.      it was a cloudless evening; very beautiful sunset.  a movement in the sky caught my attention and i looked up and saw a cylinder tumbling across the sky, end-over-end.  it was gray to dull silver in base color but shown gold-red as it reflected the sunlight.  it had a ratio of about eight-to-one (8 to 1), diameter to length and seemed to have a raised rim of some kind on one end, about a sixth of the way along it's axis.  at first my mind could not grasp what i was seeing and i thought, `well, it must be a booster stage from a rocket.'   only later did i recognize that if it were a booster rocket, it would have crashed into the ground and from its apparent size, it would have been at least five hundred (500) feet in length.  to my knowledge, no one has ever built a booster rocket of that size.     i observed it moving from the south-southeast to the north-northeast.  it never deviated its course.  it never altered its altitude.  it simply tumbled end-over-end as it moved across a blue, evening sky. then it disappeared over the mountains.         i made no notes of my sighting that evening but rather went to bed early as i planned on hunting the next morning.  the strange thing was, that night, i had a nightmare that terrified me.  i do not use the word `terrify' lightly.  i never have nightmares but this one scared me as i have never been scared before or since.  in it, something came over my camp and hovered.  in the dream, i knew `they', (whoever `they are'), were coming.  and i thought, `now wait.  they can't do that!  there are more people in the campground a half a mile away.  they'll be seen.'  but never-the-less, they stopped over my camper and shined an ultra bright light down on it, bathing the whole area around my camper for fifty (50) feet.  then two entities appeared outside my door.  they were dressed in tight fitting suits, like the old usher uniforms that people use to wear in movie theaters and they had on rimless caps of a dark gray color.  i couldn't keep them out....   and that's all i remember.  a few days later i made some notes on this dream and my observation.  i haven't been able to find those notes so a few years ago, i wrote out what i remembered, one more time.  i have never had a dream like that again.  i have never had another sighting of any kind.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

craft moving at an slow pace of speed and then the craft was almost at the end of our street. that's when i spoke out aloud to my girlfriend and said \"do you think what i think that this could be an intelligent being from another planet.\"  at the same time, i was thinking the same thing that i just said. that's when the craft did an weird movement and turned around and landed. between 25-30 feet away from us. at this point, my girlfriend and i are scared shitless and couldn't move. at this point, its going through my mind that i´m scared and that they don't mean us any harm cause i don't mean them any harm or it any harm. then suddenly,there was an bright blinding white light. i couldn't tell which part of the craft it was coming from because i couldn't see. then as suddenly as the light came on,it was off. it took me an few seconds to see properly, but when i could see ,there before us suddenly was three human like beings. they were all very tall and it appeared to be two males and one female,but i can´t be sure. their hair was very long and blondish white and their features such as their eyes,lips ,nose and ears appeared to be human like but but at the same time not . their skin was so white, it was like milk. their eyes were an brilliant pale blue . i started to think to myself , that me and my girlfriend were going to die. all of an sudden ,something strange started to happen to me . it feels like they are reading my thoughts from childhood until now like an book. i found out later that my girlfriend went through the same thing like i did. anyhow, like i was saying, they were reading my thoughts and feelings like an book. towards the end of them reading me, i hear an calm,beautiful ,welcoming female voice in my head,telling me that they were not here to hurt me or my girlfriend or anyone on this planet. that the only reason they were here was to learn more about us humans and also to protect us from the greys who do want to hurt us. they also said alot of things that i won't go into at this time. but they did say that we were attractive race of beings,which made me feel proud. by the end of this experience, i felt the safest that i felt in my life. if

a website i was looking at that said \"there is an alien in your closet.\" i didn't know what to think of it so i closed off my computer and decided to go to bed early. i took one tylenol pm pill, which i've taken before and never had any unusual reactions (i've also been tested and do not have any drug-allergies). after i took the tylenol pm, i turned on my stereo to some light music to help me relax. i lay down in bed and within 20 seconds i began to feel a warm, tingling sensation on top of my head. it startled me, so i sat up and began to run through all of the logical explanations i could think of as to what was happening, only to find none, so i  lay back down. after a few more seconds the tingling came back on my head, so i continued to lay there in curiosity. the tingling then spread down my chest to my abdomen, then through my limbs, toes, and fingers. when it reached my fingers and toes, it began reverberating throughout my body, primarily through my spine. it felt extremely intense, like the feeling of going straight down on a roller-coaster, mixed with a tickling sensation. i struggled to tolerate the sensation as it was so intense, but i held-out due to my curiosity. after about 10 seconds of this sensation, i began to feel like there was something coming out of my chest and i was being pulled into the air. the next thing i know, i'm coming back to consciousness and i feel like i'm being thrown around my room. then, i see a blue orb that's glowing, but not reflecting on anything, and after a moment i realized that i was the blue orb because i was moving with it and within it... i could see from it's perspective while at the same time seeing behind it from a third-person perspective. i was bouncing around my room and could see things i never noticed before, like some dust and cobwebs on a shelf in my room. after bouncing to one side of my room and hitting a wall, i bounced back, over my body (i could see myself in bed), and halted. i then began to materialize into a human form, but not made of organic or solid material. after i was fully materialized, i lowered into my physical body and lay in bed in a trance-like, semi-conscious, state. i shed a tear as i felt that i had experienced something incredibly amazing and possibly spiritual, and then i heard an alternating clicking noise similar to the sound of running your finger across the teeth of a fine-tooth comb. i was startled and opened my eyes, focused on my clock and saw that it was 3:30 a.M. (i had four hours of missing time), and i began thinking of what it could be, as i had never heard this sound before. then all of the sudden in my mind i thought \"alien.\" i sat up to see what it was, and at first i thought it was a child, but upon examination i realized that it was a small gray alien. it was around four feet tall, i couldn't see it's outward color, i couldn't see below it's waist as it was standing behind the foot-board of my bed, it was extremely slender and i doubt it weight any more than 80 pounds. it was staring back at me with it's arms flung out to it's sides, as if it was scared, and we stared at each other for about 30 seconds while all of the human emotions that one feels while encountering a possibly dangerous life-form took place in my mind. i wondered why it was there, what it's intentions were with me, if it had anything to do with my previous experience, and if it would try to harm me. then, to prove to myself that this was real, i slapped my face, pinched my arm, and rubbed my eyes (all of the things people do in movies when they're in disbelief of a witnessed event). after i did that and realized it was real, i focused in on it's face, which was upon a large ovular head with large ovular eyes. i couldn't see a nose or mouth, just the head and eyes. as i gazed into it's black, slanted eyes, i felt like i connected with it and we were feeling each other's fear. it became too much for me to mentally handle, so i fell into bed, pulled the covers over my head, and attempted to scream... but nothing came out. the next thing i knew, i felt it's fingers grace the sheet over my legs, and then it grasped onto them right over my shins and began to pull the sheet down slowly. the sheet began to slide down my face and when it went over my nose, i became extremely frightened and once again pulled it up and screamed for my mom as loud as i could. the next moment felt like it lasted for at least a minute, but it was probably more like 30 seconds. i heard the shuffling of it trying to flee, but i didn't hear any doors or windows open (i keep everything shut while i sleep). my mom finally came into my room and i was so mentally-exhausted from the shock and fear that all i could say to her was \"lay with me,\" and then i passed out. the next morning i was so shocked from what happened that i simply didn't think to document the date of this experience or report it to anyone... i didn't think anyone would believe me anyway. the only people i've told about this are my parents and a few close friends, but i don't think anyone truly believes me that this was real.","distance":"Unknown,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Around midnight in the middle of winter, i woke up in my parent's living room, as we had been watching an operation show and all fell asleep on our living room couch. i woke up because i had a re-occurring dream that i had often as a child, where i was having tea. as i was sleeping, i reached out my arm (to fill my cup), which is what jolted me awake. i sat up and noticed that there was no sound coming from the tv, or at least i didn't hear any, which was unusual as my father falls asleep with the tv on every night and the volume must be reasonably audible. i also noticed that i didn't hear him snoring, and when i sat up, it didn't wake up my parents (which was also unusual). then, i stood up and without reason, began to walk to our back door. i remember not understanding why i was going outside; my body felt guided to the backyard and also i knew it was too late to go in the backyard alone, and i was also wearing nothing but a petty-coat and it was freezing-cold outside (literally). nevertheless, i stood on the concrete portion of our backyard, directly in front of the door. i was looking down at my feet and thinking about how i could catch a cold for being out there, but i didn't go back inside. i then began to play with a small, pink, satin rose stitched onto the v-neck of my petty-coat when i noticed a reflection of light on the ground, from above my location. i looked up and noticed several solid, stationary lights above my head. it was difficult to tell how high they were, but i would say they were no more than 500 feet above me. i remember thinking that they couldn't be stars because they weren't blinking (i knew a lot about the sky as a child as it had always fascinated me and i commonly star-gazed on a regular basis). then i thought to myself that they couldn't be planets because they were out-of-place, and also too large. after those thoughts had passed, the lights lowered probably about 200 feet, as they went from the size of a pea to the size of a dime from my point of vision. then, they began moving, then multiplying, then connecting by a light like that of a beam, to form shapes. the shapes i remember seeing were a spider, a humming-bird, and a monkey. i didn't know it at the time, but as i got older i realized they were the same exact shapes located at the nazca planes in peru. to continue my memory, the next thing that happened was that they all came together and began lowering as a single point. at this point, the light appeared to be about the size of a house, and then a light came from the center of it and began to engulf my vision. the last thing i recall from that night is the feeling of my feet lifting off the ground as i was gazing into an endless, white light. the next thing i knew, it was morning and i was standing, completely nude, in another location of our backyard (and my petty-coat was nowhere to be found), in the snow. i remember a voice from within (my mind?) telling me to lay down in the snow and pretend that i was playing outside. i couldn't see who was saying this to me and i couldn't even hear a definite voice inside my mind... i cannot explain how i was able to \"hear\" this message, but only that it came from within myself, but i had a feeling that there was something or someone behind me and i was to not look at them, but only follow it's command. so i lay down in the snow and after a short while, my mom opened her the back window to her bedroom that faced our backyard, and yelled at me, asking what i was doing. i assume she thought i woke up at some point and went into my own room, and had still been asleep. as a result of laying in the snow, i caught pneumonia and ultimately developed asthma. oddly enough, my asthma is most commonly-activated by being physically-active during cold weather. i didn't tell anyone about my experience for years because i was just a child when it happened and didn't understand it. as i grew older and realized it was an abduction experience, i didn't know who to go to and didn't know about \"mufon\" until just a few years ago. i apologize for not having any solid evidence of this experience, but i was only a child and even if it had crossed my mind to document this event with a camera, my parents didn't own one at the time.\r\n\r\nsince then i have had another abduction experience and will submit information about that separately, if anyone is interested in it. on a personal note: my only wish out of sharing this information is to help myself, as well as others who have also had genuine abduction experiences, to better-understand what has happened to us. i am hoping that with enough personal accounts, somehow we can fit together the pieces and make sense of all of this. thank you.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,
