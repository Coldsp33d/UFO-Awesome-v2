(dusk) to aid loading my nephew's car.  i looked up into a mostly clear sky to the west with some clouds to the north and saw what looked like a sort of semi-transparent cloud streaking at a high rate of speed from south to north for about 6 seconds.  it started roughly 20 degrees above the horizon when i noticed it and running nearly parallel to the horizon, ended perhaps 10 degrees higher before suddenly disappearing in clear air.  there was no noise. in size, it looked roughly the size of my thumb nail at arms length. my impression watching it was that this cloud-like object had right angles within its body, sort of giving it the look of a semi-manufactured structure. \r\n\r\namazed, my first thought was how could a cloud move that fast.  then, it being july 4th, i thought it might be some kind of firework except that there was no smoke, no trail, no fire, no illumination of any kind.  just a gray cloud moving rapidly without changing shape or dissipating. there was no way it could be smoke left over from some firework detonating. such smoke doesn't streak across the sky intact.  (there were people starting to light fireworks, but their fireworks were unmistakable.)   i then thought it might be a plane, but aside from deviating from the usual flight path in my neighborhood, there were no lights and it simply didn't look like a solid object.  moreover, it moved much faster than any plane i've seen around my residence. (charlotte douglas airport is a few miles north of me so there's steady air traffic overhead.)   after it disappeared, i looked to see if anyone else was watching it.  my nephew hadn't noticed it and what neighbors i could see were engrossed in their festivities. i went inside the house and told the family i had just seen my first ufo, so called because i had no idea what i had just seen.  they just looked at me blankly.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":67796,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.04611585109845,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07062015-0052","longitude":-80.87201466960622,"occurred":1435968000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"South Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1436226561000,"summary":"What looked like a cloud streaking across the sky at high rate of speed.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":31,"maxtempi":88,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":81,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":73,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":31,"maxtempi":88,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":81,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":23,"mintempi":73,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"29707","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Charlotte, South Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:21648"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Montgomery","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I walked out my front door at 11:40 p.M. on 7-4-15 with my adult son. i saw a big orange-red glow above my line of vision. i knew it was not fireworks or an airplane because it was not moving and was too low. it appeared to have a glowing aura around it, and i could see a triangle shape within the glowing aura. my son and i watched it for a couple of minutes, then it began to move toward the north. i went inside the house to get the binoculars. i was not able to see much other than a ball of orange light because it had moved further away, among the treetops. at one point, it stopped for about a minute or less and then moved on and disappeared. i felt i had actually seen a ufo because i had never seen anything like this before. i told my son to film it with his phone, but all he got, by that time, was an orange ball in the sky, moving north.

walked through the door and had a very surprised look on his face.  we asked him what was wrong, and he said he may have just seen a ufo.  i didn’t believe him at first, but then he started to tell me that it has been hovering way up in the sky for about two hours.  we went outside so he could point out the object, and sure enough it was hovering in the sky very high above the city.  my judgment on distance may be a little off, but from how big it was in the sky, it looked like if it had landed it would have been very large.  it had the oddest shape to it.  it had what seemed to be very distinct and sharp edges and was chevron shaped.  i thought that it might be a bomber or a drone, but it never moved, not once.  i thought that my eyes just may be adjusting, so i used a building in front of me for perspective on the motion of the object, and from what i gathered it did not make any movements.  i stayed in one spot for about 30 minutes and didn’t move one time.  i was kind of confused because i don’t know of any planes that can hover that long in the sky without moving.  we stood outside and pointed it out to people walking by.  some were interested and started taking pictures, and some just said it was a drone or a plane and ignored it.  after standing there for about 45 min, we went back into the bar.  we came back out about 30 later, and it was still there.  i then had to

then appeared to move slightly to my left, then hover in place. then it moved to the right, all the while, appearing to come closer. my first thought was that it was a helicopter, until it changed

cloud. after a few minutes, it reappeared. it seemed to be closer the second time. i tried to video the object but before i could, it was gone. it was at this time, that i called my friend who is also a field investigator for mufon. i called him according to my cell phone at 9:27 p.M. after witnessing the object twice. while i was describing to him what i had just witnessed, the object appeared again, brighter than it had been before. i promptly told him it was back and had to hang up so i could video the object. my phone call according to my cell phone was 3 minutes and 29 seconds when i hung up. that means, the closest time that i could pinpoint to seeing the object for the third time, was 9:30 and 30 seconds.It took me approximately 10-15 seconds to have my phone up and video the object. my wife who was very close to where i was standing, also videoed the object at my request. two of my oldest children, age 10 and 7, also witnessed the object. mr. moore received my wife's

real direction. all we could see was a bright red light.  after a few min's we both noticed 2 more joining from the west. it was almost like they were playing in the sky, they would alternate doing flyby's and fly circles in the sky. we watched for a good 5 min, sitting still against the old swimming pool, then it was like a snap of a finger they were gone. we both were confused as to what happened, was nothing like we had ever scened. i knew in the back of my mind it was nothing human. we sat waiting wondering if they would return, about 10 - 15 min after they disappeared they returned doing the same thing. they came in about 3 s apart, same area. we watched for aprx 3 min, they would swirl and fly random patterns and passing (head on) each other close before one had disappeared, 5 s later the last two followed. the thing that burned into my mind was how fast they came & left. they took off in a straight line from where we were sitting, almost at a 45' angle leaving a faint red

was to the right. dfw airport is west and a few miles from the area and in the direction we were looking. (in fact, before the object was seen, we had seen a passenger plane and commented on what the passengers must have seen and thought of the fireworks). i turned to another friend sitting on the other side of me and pointed it out to her. she also saw it.  the object never moved, changed colors or anything. we all kept glancing toward it but it never moved and it stayed the same.  when the show was over after 10:00 pm and we were picking up our chairs to leave, we noticed that the object was gone, and nowhere to be seen. i believe the object was a ufo because it would have still been there if it were part of something in the area. i am probably the only one of the three of us to believe in ufo's especially since i had a previous experience in the mid-60's as a teen in oklahoma. \r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":67778,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.973798799999997,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07062015-0033","longitude":-99.8987231,"occurred":1436046000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1436199699000,"summary":"Green orb in sky with fireworks","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":33,"maxtempi":92,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":81,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":22,"mintempi":71,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":33,"maxtempi":92,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":27,"meantempi":81,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":22,"mintempi":71,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Irivng, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:21665"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Wilmington Island","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were shooting off fireworks when we noticed 2 objects bright orange/red moving in random patterns. it had no strobe lights to indicate it was an aircraft. it moved in patterns an airplane could not do. it moved too fast for a helicopter to do the patterns it did. plus they were glowing, almost a light pulse, but the color was red to orange. it also lit up some clouds it passed through. they eventually within 2-4 seconds just faded and were gone. after the two were gone a third was seen low in the tree line. we moved over to clear the trees and saw basically the same thing. it moved similar to the other two then climbed high and to our left, then looked like it moved away from us then 2-4 seconds it faded out quick. total time that we observed these objects was 3-5 minutes. when reviewing a few pics we noticed a green bowtie looking thing in one of the pics. none of us saw this when observing the three glowing orb like objects.

started moving back west. we thought it was leaving but surprisingly it hovered again, but this time standing far from the main fireworks show and flashing red-orange(or red-yellow, i'm not sure). from time to time we took a look of it, but no change. once the show finished, maybe 5 sec later, the green dot became 3 dots (not sure how the other two dots appeared) making a triangle, one instant after, there was only two dots, one green and one red, and suddenly they went away at a very high speed in west direction, with a very strange movement, think about bicycle pedals: dots up and down in opposite direction but aligned all the time.\r\n\r\nonce we arrived home, we watched the video (showing the green dot over the fireworks) and then we realized something more strange: right after i zoomed in the green dot, a second red dot is ejected from the green one at a relative low speed, east direction, then as the red dot gets more stable it accelerates at an impressive high speed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then
