downward it instead glided nw.  i ran out of the house to get a better look and it was an orb gliding slowly in a nw direction pulsating red/orange. i ran back in to grab phone/camera and dragged my husband out. when i got back it was a much smaller orb still only red orange it hadn't traveled a long distance and it then just faded out.  i was unable to get photo.  approx 30 min later a plane traveled the same path but remained visible, with the flickering lights expected from a plane. ft. bragg and pope airforce base are both nearby i am used to seeing their aircraft during training.

west/north to south east, it look pretty much like a light ball with light glowing. i was pretty sure that it’s not a normal airplane because there is fly zone far from that area and we see many flight flying every day but the strange thing is i have never seen any flight flying in that particular direction. i know how the plane looks in night, it has light blink on the wings and you can assume the shape with their light but that object was completely different, it appears to be round shape with strong light glowing all around it. me and one of my friend captured in our mobile but since we are using iphone 4s which doesn’t allow zoom option, we can’t able to zoom in. i also capture one picture. i don’t know whether this object is alien craft or extraterrestrial but i am pretty
