so i continued to watch it so i could put it out if it landed in my yard. it continued travelling towards the south and i asked my husband and 16 year old son what it was. the object passed directly overhead and we were able to look more closely. it was not an open flame. it was some kind of orange glowing object. almost like a clear bubble with a bright point of orange in it that glared. the

ground and just simply appeared high in the sky. there were seven witnesses to this event, in which there were seven lights. the lights seemed to maneuver independently, but occasionally appeared to be in two triangular formations. each object moved silently and ascended and descended slightly multiple times and sometimes moved in horizontal motions. about ten to twenty minutes later, each object began to disappear one by one. some appeared to change shape slightly by becoming more of an oval before dimming and disappearing. for the next twenty minutes or so, a couple of the objects reappeared but ascended and disappeared shortly after. we stood on the boat at the dock in confusion and debated as to what the lights could be. all of the fourth of july fireworks displays in the area had

few seconds, descended, went stationary again, then traveled west to east on a straight line.  the orb, at times, became partially obscured by a house but would either ascend above it, or move east of it to come into few. the object was never lower than 45 degrees off the horizon but probably ascended to about 75 degrees above the horizon. there were no visible flashing lights and no sound.  seabrook nuclear power plant lies just about mile west of the beach and the object seemed to split the difference of the two while the fireworks were going off.  the orb then descended behind a building and i never regained sight of it.  i was very excited and frantic while trying to keep the orb in sight.  about 15 minutes after the event, i started to think of other possibilities.  the most probable being a drone taking video of the fireworks from an elevated position.  my wife also saw the object move east to west after being stationary for about 30 seconds.","distance":"501 Feet -

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On one sunday in the summer at approximately 8:00am at some point in the period between 1947 and 1949, my mother and her two sisters were walking home after attending a children’s mass in rural providence, rhode island. \r\n\r\nat the time, all three sisters were under 10 years old. \r\ndirectly in front of their house was a field which they used as a shortcut on their way home from the church. \r\n\r\nin the field, the sisters clearly saw a 20-30 feet high metallic gray “football” shaped object (wider than it was high) possibly with multiple (3 or 4) “landing legs” resting on the ground. at that time, the sisters believed that they were possibly seeing a blimp, since they had heard of blimps and of course had seen pictures of them. they could not otherwise think of what this object could be, although they all agree it did not look like what they thought a blimp should look like up close. \r\n\r\nthey passed within 10 feet of the object but did not get closer or touch it. the object was not making any noise. no propeller was visible. the object did not have tailfins or stabilizers. there was no apparent writing on the object. there were windows/portholes visible on the object. no occupants were seen either through the windows or on the ground near the object. the object was not “tethered” to a mooring or ground vehicle as a blimp would normally require, nor was there any ground crew. the object did not have a gondola at the bottom. \r\nalthough there were nearby houses, it was early, and nobody else appeared to be awake at the time, or at least nobody was outside. \r\nupon entering their home, they told their father (my grandfather), who immediately raced out of the house to see the object. he had always been interested in technology (the kind of man who built one of the first televisions in his neighborhood from a kit). when they exited the front of the house, the field was visible, and there was no object in the field. no object was seen rising from the field or in the sky. there was insufficient time for a blimp to have flown away in the moments that elapsed since they left the field. according to my research, blimps currently travel at approximately 35mph and likely take several minutes to maneuver, rise and reach this speed from the ground. i do not know what speed blimps traveled in the 40’s, but it was most definitely not faster than today’s technology. \r\n\r\nno remaining markings on the ground were noticed, although they didn’t think to check that at the time. no further investigation was performed.\r\n\r\nmy mother recalls hearing reports of other strange sightings of objects (in the air) during that period, but nobody ever claimed to have seen this particular object. \r\n\r\nthis object was not reported to authorities by my grandfather. \r\nthe incident was never forgotten, and had been repeated verbatim since i was a child by all three sisters and my grandfather. the facts between the sisters remain generally consistent with the above, although there is some disagreement on whether the object had landing legs and the exact number of legs (0, 3 or 4). the two oldest sisters were certain it had landing legs.\r\n\r\nall three sisters are still alive (although my grandfather has passed away) and all are available to answer further questions.\r\n\r\nattached is an aerial photo of the site showing the exact landing area.\r\n\r\nyou can easily find this on google earth using the coordinates: 41&#9702;49’ 18.07” n 71&#9702;26’49.68” w. i have marked on the aerial view the location of the church and the field (note that there is a basketball court there now if you look at more recent aerial images). i have not marked the location of the house, but it was directly across (east) from the field. oddly enough, the object was seen on the ground in the southernmost corner of the field directly on the baseball diamond. the worn spot on the ground is the result of more recent baseball games. before the school was built, baseball was played there, but in a different corner of the field. \r\n\r\nthis neighborhood has changed little since that time, with the exception of the building of a school in the northern portion of the field, and the absence of a building that burned down across from the church. approximately 5 houses were torn down to clear the way for the school, so the field is roughly the same size as it was in the 40’s. \r\nmy mother is one of the most trustworthy sources i know, and i say that not only because she is my mother. she is old fashioned to an extent, and not prone to a wild imagination or belief in any new age theories. apart from this one event, she has lived a very normal lower-middle class life with no deviations into the unusual whatsoever. she has one unusual characteristic – she can remember the finest details of the most mundane events, so remembering this event is particularly easy for her. she can recall the neighborhood with amazing detail. she can tell you what color each house was in the neighborhood back in the 40’s. this is, of course, a single event 60 years ago, so there is naturally some faded memory of this event.\r\n\r\nmy aunts are also trustworthy, with one of them being a former teacher and the valedictorian in mathematics from a large rhode island college. i have never known any of them to exaggerate or fabricate stories. \r\n\r\nattached is the witnesses best approximation of the object.","distance":"20 Feet or

took me to the area where they were launching the fireworks. it was about 10:00 pm est when me and my father noticed a lone light in the sky, at first we though nothing of it but then it started to pulsate a little, this caught my attention and when i directed my dad towards the light. at first he didn't see it because of the fireworks but when there was an interval he saw and stated that's a little weird. it just hovered and stayed there while we tried to debunk what it could be. it was not an airplane for it was stationary and did not have triangular light pattern, it was a singular light. my dad pulled out his star map app on his phone and when he pointed it at the object the closest thing it could be was a star ( i can not remember the name but it is one of the brightest stars in the night), but it was far to the left. then we though of helicopters (this of course was when the terrorist organization isis threatened america for an attack on july 4th and there were swat and helicopters in the sky). so as of now that is the most logical reasoning for a natural and man-made explanation. after about ten minutes the light then turned a white-red and then flew down or flew away (from my angle i could not tell) very fast. then after that i never saw the object again. the only way i could describe it was mesmerizing and, in a way, glad to have encountered a ufo for the first time. my dad believes it is a helicopter, but as for me i do not think so. for one it was a singular green light that turned white-red, two it flew away at fast speeds that was faster than a descending or accelerating helicopter, three the helicopters had search lights on and this light did not have that at all and it was behind the fireworks, and finally it was stationary while the helicopters were patrolling the area. so in my own personal opinion, this was a ufo and not anything man-made, and while i may be approached with people saying you just imagined it or you were seeing and misinterpreting things but i know what i saw, and i will affirm to this opinion unless strongly proven otherwise.

( meanwhile fireworks are going off all around us and this craft has our rapt attention)! my wife came back out and immediately started to film it on her smartphone, we ended up with approx. seven minutes of video but during that time all we could do is watch this object in between the burst of the fireworks celebration which it seemed very interested in as it seemed to be drawn to the larger explosions. it continued to change color between the blue-green to red-orange as it changed direction or sped up and slowed down. it had a range of speed from just hovering to darting through the sky in an instant, ascending, descending at times and changing course at very unusual angles, sometimes slowly, other times quickly. we all thought about what it could be, a very different firework, a helicopter, a blimp, a drone, a prank somebody conceived because everyone in the neighborhood would be watching up into the nighttime sky and what a dupe or \"viral-video\" that would make but in the end none of these made any sense. as in the end it darted out a bit of instant, returned half the distance and started to descend beyond the trees and went out of sight. we all at some point thought it was a ufo and explained what we each saw and all agreed it wasn't anything like any of us had seen before. my wife later uploaded her video to her computer and we both understood why 99% of the videos you see of the ufo sightings are so grainy, you just don't expect to see something like this and when you do you use the best tool available to you to record it and in this case it was a smartphone. aliens, i don't know. ufo, meaning that none of us in our group could identify it, yes. i'm just hoping to see something about this on the news tomorrow to verify what we saw wasn't a july fourth event the city of las vegas put on to wow it's citizens! we're hoping others saw this as there have had to be dozens of witnesses with it being the 4th of july and so many would have been looking into the sky enjoying the firework celebrations.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":67717,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.1565349295064,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07052015-0079","longitude":-115.24613367559175,"occurred":1435968000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1436120620000,"summary":"Glowing, hovering sphere","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/67717_submitter_file1__VegasJuly4thSighting2015.mp4"],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":39,"maxtempi":102,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":36,"meantempi":97,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":33,"mintempi":91,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":39,"maxtempi":102,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":36,"meantempi":97,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":33,"mintempi":91,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"89117","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Las Vegas, Nevada","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:22141"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Sandusky","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Me and my fiance was at the racetrack in sandusky watching races. and all of a sudden i noticed 4 bright orbs off in the distance. we watched them for about a minute and then remembered my cell can take recordings. so i recorded about a minute of these lights.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":67716,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.4574196,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07052015-0078","longitude":-82.7052605,"occurred":1435968000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1436118565000,"summary":"Lighted orbs changing direction with lights fading in and out","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":27,"maxtempi":80,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":20,"meantempi":68,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":13,"mintempi":55,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":27,"maxtempi":80,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":20,"meantempi":68,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":13,"mintempi":55,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Sandusky, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:22142"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Cold Spring","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband, mother and i were in cold spring, ny for the 4th of july fireworks.  after the fireworks while in the municipal parking lot we looked at the stars in the sky and their constellations.  we noticed one bright \"star\" that was not like the others.  the glowing object was orange in color and moved north slowly over west point military academy.  at one point it remained stationary.  several times it emitted smaller glowing lights from its rear/bottom that appeared to fall down and disappear.  the object disappeared and reappeared several times.  after 8-10 minutes we did not see it reappear and decided to leave to go home.

are not planes because i can see them to, and i live at 18 km from lisbon, front of the sea, atlantic ocean.\r\nin the 80s and since then i put my self in doubt because i thinking maybe there was satellites.\r\ni went to army, nato cryptologist and communications operator, 5 years of my life in the nato communications centre in lisbon, 1st corporal. i was all my life a communications and informatics technician, retired from portugal telecom.  \r\nnow we got laptops and software to track satellites in real time and i never got a match from the things i see.\r\ni got the impression i am living under a high altitude alley {from the 20 to 50 km altitude}, i see every night this dots of light at an incredible speed, they cross all this region in less than noting, coming and go from all directions. some we can see with naked eye, others because off the pollution, only with binoculars.\r\nbut in the friday the 24 of june i make the observation of my life till now, i start to see a very fast flashing light, 3 times more than a plane and was a mixing of white/blue thunder light coming from north, then more 5 dots show up behind the first one the moving very slow, without noise coming from different directions. the first one stay at front and the others stop in the sky above my head, i shout to my son to come up and see and he fells afraid. they stay 2 to 3 minutes and after they start to move to the directions i describe. i see yesterday 2 of this ones. \r\ndear sir my concern is only one, this planet belongs to who?\r\nwe people of earth we got the solar fleet or not? if not, thats the reason because the superpower country of the world make segregation of this subject, now i understand...\r\ni upload some home vídeos not edited from 1 or 2 dots i could recorded

this objects and i invite some one to look at the sky at night and see what i see every night. they are not satellites, they are at 800 km + - and at a speed 7.8 km sec, never match the software

was around 10:30ish at address listed.  we were looking at the big dipper ( was straight over ahead at time.) \r\n\r\nin the back yard i was sitting at,  the fireworks already were starting to come to an end. or less frequent at the time.  but the view or patch of sky we were looking at the time was mostly (n or nw bound.)\r\n\r\nwhile observing the sky, i gazed again towards the night sky in a north direction, and i saw this hovering dredal looking object ( which suddenly appeared must) , if i held something in the air to compare its size it would of been bigger then a grain of rice, but smaller then an aspirin. \r\n\r\ndescription was dredal shaped, it had a 1/3 white top and the 2/3 bottom half  and it was green. it was steady glowing. at first i thought it maybe some type of firework, but no explosion, then maybe i thought it was an airplane in the distance  flying toward us or away. but again it remained stationary and size remained the same.\r\n\r\ni'm ex-military and i'm very familiar in the aviation field, i would say on an expert level. i do have qualifications backing up this claim.\r\n\r\ni knew right away now, i was observing a ufo. my brother in law who was watching this with me, and my sister saw it also.  he thought it possibly could be a drone. although, i do not have any experience with drones. logic still applies,  if this a drone i'm seeing, then it was a professional or possibly a military grade small aircraft. \r\n\r\nwhat i witnessed was zero erratic movement, it was as stationary as a star while it hovered for over a minute, and when it descending. it was a perfectly straight line with out any turbulence ( no sudden dips) , that a small flying craft should experience.\r\n\r\nsecondly, it couldn't of been a helicopter,  although it moved like one on a y-axis. it was silent and close enough we would of heard it and there was not any strobe or beacon lights, and the descending movement was way to fast and way to low for recovery. if it was a helicopter without a crash. the best word to describe the way it descended was a fluid like. \r\n\r\nmy best description of the even it was unnatural, and something i was very unfamiliar with of any type of aviation craft i have seen.  shape/colors/movement/silence, were all foreign to me. i believe i witnessed some type of remarkably new technology or something other worldly. either way it was an ufo for sure.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

above the city. we walked towards it beginnt to assume it was a human unmanned aircraft then we realized there was a black rotating oblique cylinder rotating inside an almost clear perfect circle. it rotated every second inside the sphere. the sphere looked like it was somehow carrying this black object. it hovered while it ascended. it gave off the impression it was moving slow but somehow ended up going from low down by the city all the way up past where jets fly until it was gone. it's coloring didn't change as it got higher. you could see the piercing black of it way beyond where you see a jet fly. the object inside of it rotated the whole time and it was silent. we both have never seen anything like it. it felt like a movie. the pictures submitted are the object drawn by my mother and i in seperate rooms. we almost drew the same thing without talking about it.
