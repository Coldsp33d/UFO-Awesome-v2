and heard they are attracted to fireworks.  so, i took my phone out and was armed and ready for shots of at least one on the evening of july 4, 2015.  turns out i saw 3 following one another and about 10 minutes later another one. the way the lights were pulsating it couldn't of been a chinese lantern. too strong of a pulse.  the first 3 were over 2000 feet high and started to climb through the clouds until disappeared. the last one was somewhat lower and took a different path of the previous 3. my husband has an atp rating and has flown for 40 years. i called him out to look. he said it didn't have the navigational colored lights on them like a plane would have. i asked him what the altitude was and he said around 2000 feet and was climbing by the time he got outside. my brother took a photo as well of an orb last night (4th of july) in tennessee. he was around fireworks himself. i had told him about these being seen around fireworks. his photo was similar to what i took. he was hunting once  around the 4 corners area and saw a strange light at night. it made him feel uneasy and went back to his vehicle and slept the night in it. he said he also called his wife to tell her.  a couple of my photos when blown up look like there could be a solid object in center. i'll leave that for the professionals to figure out. i would like for someone to look at these photos blown up and tell me what their thoughts are on what these could be. so please get back with me concerning photos and video. you will see two separate pulsating lights in the video. the video isn't long because i wanted to zoom in on the objects and i couldn't do that with video on my phone. i started taking still shots. the video shows the 4th and last one that came by. it was lower and climbed into the clouds out of sight. it also had somewhat a different flight path.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

south, however, i could not see anything. i turned to the north to go back inside, where there is usually nothing but a mountain range, i saw two bright green lights ascending straight up from the mountain. the lights were so bright and large, i thought a helicopter would be flying over my head in a second. instead the vehicle stopped it’s straight up vertical assent in midair and hovered there completely silent and changed colors from green to red once stationary. there it stayed completely still and silent for several minutes. i yelled for my husband to come outside and he did. as he walked out of our patio door, he said, “what is that?” but he was looking in the wrong direction. i was facing west looking at the mountain range and he was facing east looking at the same mountain range. he was now telling me to look at what he was seeing and was i telling him to turn around and look at what i was seeing. he finally did so and then the vehicle which was stationary and red, turned green again and descended back down into the mountain range. he next looked back to the east to see if what he had originally seen was still there and it was not. he said, “call me if it comes back, i am going to get my camera.” it wasn’t but a few minutes when i yelled back into the house that it was back, as it was bright green again and raising straight up out of the mountain range. he was now outside with his nikon and a tripod which he positioned on our patio dining table. once ascended, the vehicle turned red again and was perfectly still for 20 minutes plus. my son and his girlfriend had time to come outside, pull up patio chairs, get binoculars, go back inside to get their jackets as we watched the vehicle hover in midair for 25 minutes. i then spotted a small airplane rounding and banking straight towards us and the unknown craft. at this exact point, the craft moved slightly, then made a 360 turn, turned from red to green and descended back down into the mountain range and finally out of slight. i thought as soon as the plane passed, it would reemerge again, but then realized that everyone who had been turned east to watch various firework shows in the valley, were now most likely moving around and driving around and if the craft had enjoyed 30 minutes of privacy, that was now over, as well as, the fireworks. needless to say, it did not reemerge. many things went through my mind as to what this could be. a very large drone videotaping the san gabriel valley and inland empire firework shows, or a friendly ufo, who picked the perfect time to play a visit. either way, we captured 5 videos and enjoyed watching whatever it was, more than we would have enjoyed watching fireworks and sitting in traffic.

around.  there wer maybe 4 or 5 of us at the time. standing outside of my house for some reason i looked up and pointed the disk out to my friends.  it made no noise but was spinning and lights were circling on the bottom.  the lights were patterned. red, blue, and i,can't remember if there were any other colors.  we were quite excited by this time. it stayed over us for maybe 30 seconds and then it zipped off. but we could still see it going like it might have been in distress.  of course never seeing anything like this we ran after it thinking it would come down where we could find it. as far as i know it didn't come down.\r\n\r\non one other occasion, it was dark just about dusk or a little darker.  i saw triangle shaped ships standing still in my grandmothers yard. there were 6 of them.  they stood still like they were just hanging there no noise.  i called my father and he saw them too.  he told me never to mention it anyone.  so i didn't.  now i am going on 65 and i think

next morning to the local radio station. all kinds of erratic flight under direct control of someone.....Very weird!\r\n\r\nalso saw small whitish figure in parents' bushes - which we interpreted as a

house. \r\n\r\nbrother explained he didn't have authority to do that....They were definitely like descriptions of the men in black. my girlfriends and i had noticed their car sitting down the road a

daughter and her family. as we turned west onto 180th st, i saw pinkish-orange lights in the sky. at first i thought it was fireworks, but they didn't explode or make any noise. there were five round lights flying together from the northwest towards the southeast. three of them stayed fairly close together, and two of them would move off in different directions, return to the three others, and then move off again. they seemed fairly low in the sky, maybe 1000 feet, although that is just a rough estimation and we had no point of reference.   i could not see any distinguishing features. while fireworks were going off around us at intervals, none were close by, and in the intervals we could tell that there was no sound coming from the slowly moving lights. i thought possibly helicopters, but dismissed that due to the silence and the random flying formation. i stopped the car and asked my husband, do you see that? what is that? and he said he saw them and didn't know what they were. i looked around but there were no other people out on the street, or i would have called their attention to the objects. \r\n\r\nwe saw these lights float gracefully and slowly, in absolute silence, over us and heading towards the southeast. we did not grab cameras although i thought about it, but my phone is new and by the time i could have figured out how to take pictures, the lights were gone. they just blinked out.  i asked my husband, “did we just see a ufo?” and before he could answer i said, “well, we don’t know what it is and it’s flying, so by definition, it is.” \r\n\r\nwe had been driving down i-5 for an hour and fireworks had been going off at intervals, so we were kind of keeping an eye on the sky. at first, when i saw these lights, i thought, \"fireworks\" but as they moved so slowly and silently, i changed that to \"helicopters?\" and thought, no. has to be ufo. there was no chopper sound. i was interested and curious and a little excited, but not frightened. my husband describes his emotional response as \"interested.\"\r\n\r\ngiven that it was independence day, i should add that neither my husband nor i had had any alcohol during the day. we do not use any recreational drugs. we had been a little tired coming home, but had full use of our faculties and had been talking in the car- neither of us had fallen asleep.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

started barking. looking in the direction of the girl and her dad. above them over the trees i saw an orb like orange and yellow object rising from the south east heading south east. at first this was about 9:30 pm  this thing was moving and ascending slow by the distance it was hard to tell the size. but as it moved to the south it gained height and moved slow. i texted my friend adam he and his family live right across from the park. i am sure he thought i was messing with him, he came over and this thing still glowing  and moved up and out fast to the south.He looked in the direction and it got smaller and was gone. my wife came back and the father and his daughter walked over with her to see the dogs that were still barking. i told her and the father and adam who were still there what happened . then low to the south heading to the east it appeared with all of us wondering what it is. my wife took out her phone and videoed it move up and south to south east. adam took out his phone and fallowed it our view was slight lee hiding by the trees. the at first i thought it to be a candle box but it was not going with the wind. the girl said that the candle box burn out and fall. i taught she was wright.But this never burned out.Adam came back in disbursal. we talked about it for a wile and the father and daughter left. we packed up and said good night to adam and drove home, about a 1 minute ride , that's why i was so accurate  with the directions of the orb.When we got home i was on the deck looking at the big dipper south east sky and there it was bright and still i called my wife and she taped it again for about five minutes, it moved up to the south east and slow.Then it picked up speed and was heeding south east on an angle higher and faster and was gone.

stationary object in the southern sky above st. stephen’s church.  i extended my left arm toward the object and raised my thumb as a reference for size.  this object was the size of my thumbnail.  i estimated it to be approximately eight hundred feet above the ground.  i based this estimate on the objects location in relation to the peak of st stevens church below it, and the cumulus cloud cover behind it.  i would describe this object as a ball of light.  it was bright red, and twinkled orange to yellow at its core.  i had determined at this point it was not an airplane, helicopter, drone, or fire work flare.  it was stationary.  there was no sound associated with the object.  \r\ni drove out of the parking lot on to culver street and traveled west intending to cross the bridge to lock island.  i continued to view the object.  i slowed down in order to observe the object for three or four seconds at a glance.  the object was now moving west parallel to my line of travel.  it had matched my speed of fifteen miles an hour and was visible at sixty degrees to my left as i traveled south west.  while i was on the bridge i again compared the object to the landscape and my thumb nail.  the cumulus cloud cover remained a reliable reference in the background.  it was now just above the trees located in the area of the old paper mill.  i estimated the object to be approximately two hundred feet above the ground.  its size was still consistent with my thumbnail.   \r\ni continued on lamson road and turned onto pendegast road. after traveling only a short distance, i pulled to the side of the road.  the object was behind me.  i stepped out of my truck.  at this point the object passed very close to me, approximately fifteen degrees off my zenith.  as the object moved in front of me i began to record it on my cell phone.  it was now in front of me traveling in a northwest direction.  the object climbed steadily and maintained a trajectory of approximately sixty degrees above the horizon.\r\nthe length of my recording was forty-one seconds. the time stamp of the recording was 20150707_213513.  i estimate the entire event lasted approximately fifteen minutes.

that come out at night around the 4th of july, so i wanted to see if there was any chance we could spot them. one of the nights we were there, we decided to get right on the edge of the lake to try and get a good vantage point. i had heard that the orbs are mostly sighted between 8:30 and 10:30 pm. we were on top of a small bank facing north, probably a couple hundred yards from the lake and about 100 feet about the water level. a couple minutes past 10:30 pm (if i had to guess, i would say 10:32) we saw a circular red/orange light come up above the tree line off to our right. it crossed the sky travelling from east to west. we looked at it through our binoculars, and it looked like there was some kind of flame at the bottom, so part of me was thinking it could have been a chinese lantern...But this object was moving fast. faster than a any chinese lantern probably could. as soon as we saw it, i became very excited, but also quite scared. i was able to take a picture of it with my phone, but the quality is very poor. as it crossed the sky it seemed like it was getting a little smaller than when it first appeared, but then again, i have no idea how to distinguish a change in size from a change in altitude. it then started to descend ever so slightly, and started to get dimmer and dimmer until it was no longer visible. if i had guess, i would say that the entire phenomenon probably lasted about 30 seconds. the remarkable thing was, exactly 10 minutes later (about 10:42) a second orb appeared. it looked exactly the same as the first and had the exact same flight pattern. we waited for a 3rd one to appear, but it never came. i'm going to be looking for these things a lot more that that i have actually seen them with my own eyes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

anybody was outside seeing the same thing but saw no one. so i got my other phone and dialed my sister as fast as i could while watching it slowly moving at the same pace..And when she answered i quickly asked what does a drone look like when its flying??? and as she was explaining it turned left and was going a different path..And after a second or two it started slowly dimming out and as i

the street and the church across the street (incarnation catholic church) would have adults and older teens supervise the children playing street games, such as basketball, shuffleboard, street hockey, etc. at dusk they would begin bringing in any equipment used back into the church. as this was happening at the intersection of st. nicholas ave. and 175st. i turned my head and noticed out of the corner of my eye to my left a craft in the air. as a kid i loved watching airplanes and a rare occasional blimp if i was lucky. at first i thought it might be a blimp because of the slow movement, but as it got closer i realized that it was a disk. i noticed that it was totally quiet. the bottom was flat and reflective and looked like modern stainless steel, but darker in color. the top had windows the turned slowly in groups of twos and threes. for example, it would be two close together and a space, then three together and a space after. i observed it for about a minute before i yelled out, \"flying saucer.\" after that i remember hearing a lot of the adults talking about it as it moved slowly north in a straight line towards the area of the george washington bridge. i watched it for approximately seven minutes in total before running upstairs to tell my mom what i had just seen. this is what i remember to the best of my recollection. there were many witnesses, but it happened so long ago that i don't remember anyone else besides my sister that was a witness. unfortunately she past away 18 years ago.","distance":"101-500
