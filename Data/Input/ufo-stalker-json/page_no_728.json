with a girlfriend.  over the years, we saw at least three ufos together, and saw several individually there in sierra vista.  during the time that i was stationed there everyone i know saw numerous strange lights and objects in the sky.\r\n\r\none morning, it had to be a saturday or sunday, my girlfriend and i went for a walk together.  we wandered the length of a canal that is bordered by 7th on the west, coronado on the east, and just barely south of carmelita dr, behind the houses that face north on carmelita.\r\n\r\nwe came to a perfect circle of sand, and inside of that circle was a perfectly round circle impression.  i don't remember the diameter of the impression, but it was probably between five and nine feet.  in the center of the circle, facing north, was a severed cow's head.\r\n\r\nthe sand was out of place, since everything else around there was dirt.  there were no footprints, track marks, or anything like that anywhere in the sand.  i figured that whoever made the circle impression would have to have left tracks, or at least some marks into, or out of, the sand, where they walked up to the circle, or placed the head, but there was no indication that anyone had tried to cover tracks either.\r\n\r\nthere were no burn marks, no other body parts, and no blood.  the head was fresh, and therefore should have been bleeding, but there was no blood under the head.  i walked through the circle to examine the head.  there were two large ticks on the head that looked to have died while trying to feast on it.  i thought that the presence of dead ticks in mid meal was just as strange as finding a head with no footprints or blood.  after all, the ticks would probably not have been on a live cow, and why would they have died on the dead cow?\r\n\r\nthe girl that i was with was completely uninterested.  that was her standard response to everything out of the ordinary though.  i found it really odd, but forgot about it until recently when i was going through some other ufo experiences that i had out there and have been reporting them to mufon.\r\n\r\nthere is nothing to say that it was related to the strange lights and experiences we were all having at the time, but coupled with the other weird things that were going on during the weeks prior to, and post, cow head discovery, i figured that it could be relevant.","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":67666,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.588448,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07052015-0031","longitude":-110.344383,"occurred":955353600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

but it did not go out so i thought it might have been a star. then it started to move and suddenly got brighter and bigger as it did so i could see a reddish tint to the top of what appeared to be a glowing ball almost like a fire glow. i then asked my cousin's wife and brother-in-law if i was the only one seeing it. they were also watching when it suddenly changed the direction and then a few minutes later it dimmed and then just vanished from the sky. we were all shocked and were talking about it and how it was unfortunate that no one had taken a picture or had even thought about it. my cousin resumed shooting the fireworks and about 15 minutes later another one appeared in the same area as the first one, i was upset because my camera and phone were in the house and there was no way anyone would ever believe me without any physical proof. my brother-in-law and my cousins wife then took out their phones and began recording, my cousins wife's phone would only show the object zoomed at maximum and i am not certain if my brother-in-law got a good recording. as my brother-in-law moved further towards the field to get a better look my kids and his kids noticed the object too, and my niece became very upset. as we thought to go get my father and sister, the object once again turned, dimmed, and disappeared from the sky. i was fascinated by the whole thing, this is not the first

dscn0221 is a still picture shows the streetlight that was in the bottom of the video; and dscn0222 is a still picture of an orb to the north northeast.  in the high overhead view the viewing location is the red star.  path 1 is the first orb which roughly traveled that path west then northwest pausing and hovering a few times.  path 2 is the second orb which came in from the west, stopped then moved off to the northwest.  paths 3 and 4 were the 2 orbs in the video that moved in from the west stopped then 4 ascended and moved north then both went off to the northwest. path 5 was the 5th sighting of an orb which just moved west then northwest.  path 6 was the orb that came in from the west, stopped, turned off the glow at the black hexagon location and continued east past me overhead.  path 7 i believe was the same one from path 6 now coming back west and then northeast.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":67642,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.513649330009198,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07052015-0007","longitude":-82.51090640213545,"occurred":1436045100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1436057057000,"summary":"Several glowing orange orbs seen over about a 45 minute period.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"34608","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Spring Hill, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:22633"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":728}
