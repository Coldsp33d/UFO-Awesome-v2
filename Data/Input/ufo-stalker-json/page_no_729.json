lights independently of each other began to swivel and turn from green to red and back to green  it then descended very slowly till went behind tree line.  these objects were visible by naked eye, no actual structure was seen, it was just pure light.  looked at them through binoculars, but still no structure was seen only pure light.  there was no sound associated with the lights but sound was heard from the planes passing by while observing these lights.  all witnesses are adults, above 40, no alcohol was consumed prior to observation.  this was our first ever witnessing an event like this

their nightly \"duties\".  i usually take my phone with me in case they decide to dawdle, but since fireworks were going off i didn't anticipate either of them being out very long, so i unfortunately did not have it with me.  \r\n\r\nless than a minute after i went out, i observed the first of the objects moving slowly from roughly ne to a southerly direction while looking up for fireworks.  it was not traveling in a straight line, but rather a somewhat meandering path.  the object did seem to favor turning toward its left (my right) more than any other direction.  on 2 occasions during my first sighting, it appeared to emit either flames or sparks from what i can only assume would be the rear of it (it could have been the bottom, as none of the objects ever got close enough to view any type of definite shape). the emissions only lasted for at most 3 seconds, and they reminded me very much of the \"trails\" left behind while someone is welding, with pieces of glowing metal staying lit slightly longer than the sparks from the weld itself.\r\n\r\nwhen i first sighted it, i assumed it was nothing more than a roman candle or some such type of firework, but i immediately discounted that when the light neither faded nor moved toward the ground in a downward arc.  my next thought was a helicopter, but i've heard them fly overhead many times before and even with all the noise from the fireworks around me, i could not discern any sound from the object. \r\n\r\nby this time, the object seemed to speed up a bit while moving over the roof of our home, so i immediately took the dogs in and called for my fiancee.  she arrived a few seconds later, and when i went into the backyard in an attempt to reacquire sight of the object, i was unable to see it.  i started around the side of the house for a better view of the southern sky when she called to me from the back porch.  she had sighted not only 1 but 3 identical objects - one at a heading (that i confirmed after the sighting was over via my phone's compass) of roughly 290 degress magnetic, while the other 2 seemed to be much closer to each other at approximately 310 degrees magnetic.  one of those objects seemed to be slightly lower an to my right of it's mate, but since they were apparently very far away i was unable to determine if that was actually the case or if one of them was simply lower to the horizon than the other. it may have been possible that these were 3 additional objects from my original sighting as i have no way of knowing if my initial object circled around to join the \"group\".\r\n\r\ni immediately ran inside to grab my phone, but by the time i got back outside 2 of those 3 objects had vanished.  my fiancee verified the flames/sparks that i observed - they came out of each of these new objects, but not in unison. i originally got some still shots using my \"perfectly clear\" app on my phone, but then realized that app does not shoot video, so i had to switch over to the stock android camera app for that.  i was not sure if the videos were actually being shot, so that is why i have multiple videos before the final one.  just as with the other 2 objects she observed, the final one either ascended into the sky until it was no longer visible or the light slowly faded on it.  \r\n\r\na few final observations: while taking the stills and videos i thought they might be drones of some sort (i own one myself), however i have yet to see one that's capable of carrying a payload that would emit the flames/sparks...I assume that would be far too heavy for a civilian drone to carry.  also, i would like to state that my fiancee is a management official at a local health care facility, and she is far more skeptical about anything out of the ordinary than i am, and even she has no explanation for what they were, and was slightly shaken afterward.\r\n\r\nps: i have more photos and a couple very short videos that i am unable to attach, but none of them show any more

said, \"oh look, it is here to see the fireworks.\" then we stopped laughing as the light stopped moving, and we realized it wasn't an airplane at all.  it was pretty bright, and moving in a se direction, when it suddenly stopped and hovered for about 30 seconds or so.  we continued to watch it, then it began to fade which took about 10 seconds, and then blinked out.\r\nit was neat to see,

times by the same observer.\r\n\r\ndriving east on route 37 i spotted a rectangular object to the east. my position was near the intersection of hooper avenue on route 37 east near 149 route 37 east in toms river. the object was rectangular, white, and moving southward relative to my position. it was very small leading me to believe the object was a mile or two from my current position.\r\n\r\nmy first impression was \"this was just a large banner someone's flying over the seaside heights beach\". beach banners tend to be red letters on black netting, rather than presented as a large bedsheet. what convinced me to contact mufon was not seeing a plane towing it. my father-in-law was in the car with me, i remarked, \"that's strange\" but he was oblivious or thought i was talking about something else. before i approached the stop and shop on 353 route 37, the object was now low on the horizon and difficult to observe.\r\n\r\nthe distance between the two points is a little over a mile.\r\n\r\nwe made a stop and drove south down coolidge from bay avenue. while heading south on coolidge, and passing raider way, time approximately 17:05, i saw the white rectangle again. no plane was visible towing the object. after (maybe) two minutes, the object went behind trees while heading south. the rectangle was a bit larger from this vantage. the object was hidden by treetops before i reached the light on windsor ave. this time i pointed out the object to my father-in-law, he remarked \"huh\" but made no further comment.\r\n\r\ni believe there's a chance this might've been a case of mistaken identity, this being a banner, but banners tend to be much longer rather than having the dimensions of a postcard. it's strange enough to report, and i'd like to know whether or not there's a prosaic explanation.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

was walking down the road,returning from a friend's house. most people in my village are asleep by this time. my road dips down on a preettty steep angle, going to a beach (hobart's beach) on the avon river. out of nowhere, comes this light, pulsating between a deep red and pure white high in the sky, about a mile over where the water would be. then, the thing exploded into 10 lights in a disc like hover, and flew right over me. then, they all combined and disappeared. i ran into my house, and called my sister, and she told me to come and fill out this form. then. i heard this bomb-like noise followed by a loud deep humming noise, like a ship's horn but way deeper. outside there was another red light, this time not pulsating, and it split into two, returned to one, and dived lightning fast into what would be the water. i then turned all the lights on in my house and hid in the bathroom. that is where i am as i write this.","distance":"Over One

a triangle in the sky it wasnt far away from me but it was high in the sky, i didnt know what to think i had never saw anything like it before. so at the next wide spot i pulled off and amed my head lights at it, it had red,blue,green,yellow,an whiteish lights around the edge of the object and black in the center.I sit there for a few minutes just watching it,it didnt move it wasnt making any sound,i thought to my self if i flash my headlights at itmay do something,so i begain to flash my head lights at it, and it did nothing so i started to leave but before i did i thought i would try it one more time. and as i started to flash my lights it started brighting an diming back,to be honest that excited me! so i decided to get underneath it because it wasnt far away just high in the sky so i took off to get under it i went about a mile an seen 3 people standing beside there car looking at it. as i passed them i saw a road to the right that i thought would put me underneath it but it a dead end road that went into the woods next to a field so i stopped an got out and then started through brush because i had lost sight of it in the trees an brush. but as i got to the clearing were the field was i saw a light blue light that covered a field that was on the other side of a creek from the field i was coming in,it was like the light was coming out of pure blackness it looked darker behind the beam than everywhere else so i bent down to crawl under the bobwire that was around the field but as i got up the light was gone, so i looked up to see if i could see the triangle and was there so i walked in the fieldto get under it,so when i got as close as i could i remembered that i just bought a lighter so i got it out an lit it and started moving it left to right it never done anything so i started making differnt shapes it never moved until i made a circle, an when i did it bobbingan moving left to right and then it stoped so i did it again but this time when started bobbing iseen it was getting closer and a light blinked on beside it. it would blink off an on and every time it blinked on in different spot in the blink of an eye it would do that an as i was watching all of the sudden a light just blinked on to the left of me not a foot above the trees beside me i could have hit it with a rock, it was about 10 or 15 foot high an4 foot wide it was like it just fliped on it was bright but didnt shine it was like it was contained inside the shape it was in you could fantly see the leaves on the top of the tree but the funnyest thing about it was that i couldnt move i couldnt take my eyes off it all i could do is move my eyes as it moved toward town and when it moved far enough away i could move again an when i could i looked up to see if the other thing was still there but to my surprize there wasnt just one any more there wereat least 15 triangles and eachone had a light around it,it was like a star beside eachone that blinked on an off around eachone. an at this time when i saw this a fear came over me to this day i dont know why but i was terrorfied\r\nso i started running toward my truck, when i got to my truck i got in an started leaving when i got to the top of the hill i stuck my head out to see if i could see them behind me, an they were. i took my side mirror an pointed up to keep sight of them, when i got home which was only 2 miles give or take.When i got home i ran in the house to tell my wife what had happened she said where have you been its 1.00am in the morning, to me i know i was just gone for 1 mabe 1 an a half hours not no 5 hours i told her what had happened an that thay have followed me here i got my flashlight an went outsideto see if thay were still there but what i saw was different. it looked like a scalene triangle and it was redish orange and right over my home but high in the sky i took my light an pointed it at them an tried to see if thay would follow the light, some would and others wouldnt it was :amazing: as i was doing this my wife was hanging out the window looking an then all of the sudden it was like glitter falling to my right i turned to my wife an said did you see that she said yea but as fast as the glitter started it stoped.And at that moment i saw a bright light and it was no ordnary light and it was right over the four lane across from were i live an i have to say it was very big!!Lie the size of a two story house not moving no sound i took my flashlight an started flashing it toward it an as i did it changed shapes from a circle, to a circle with two legs on the bottom an when i flashed it again it went back to a circle what made the light also stange was that it looked like liquid inside and it was constantly moving i got excited an jumped in my truck an started toward it as i did a redish,orange ball of light came at me about the size of a beachball i rammed my breaks on because i thought it was going to hit me,but right at that moment it took a sharp left turn an started zig zagging around the houses going east.After i lost sight of it i started to the light again but when i got closer it started backing up an when i got as close as i could to it it stoped it was like it knew i couldnt get any closer without going in the woods. so i just bent down an watched it.I knelt there for about 30 mins until i had to leave because i had to go to work the next morning. and it stayed there til i went to bed, an when i got up the next morning i opened the curtain to just see if it was still there, at first i seen nothing but as i looked around i saw a plane going acoss the sky,right above where i had saw the light the night before as i was looking at it i saw a black line going stright up if i would have held my hand up to see the distance from the plane to the black line it would have been about two and a half inchs the plane was about 3,8ths of an inch long an the black line was around 2 inchs long i am trying to give you an idea of how high it was in the sky and how much bigger the black line was frm the plane and i am not for sure if the plain was a fighter jet or a passenger jet because it was so high in the sky but if it was a passenger jet what ever the black line was that was going toward space had to be over a mile long.But thats my assumption.And then i had to leave to go to work an that was the last of the sighting...But i also want to say after this event, its like memories came flooding in, of past events that had happen in my life even from when i was real small,... the reason why i am telling you this is that mabe you can help me because i have not been the same since!! and i hope you can help me find answers an not think i am :crazy: like everyone else i have told this too!! thank you so very much! and i hope to hear from you.But if not thanks anyway. ronald owens...   \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile,
