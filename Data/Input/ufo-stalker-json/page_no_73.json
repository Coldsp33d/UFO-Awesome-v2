how to grow my own food and to work on a path of spiritual enlightenment. i had become incredible proficient in meditating and found a calling to become a healer. at the time of the encounter i had been working with healing through the human energy field and i had become pretty good at it. one night i took my dog up on the large hill that was attached to the property i was staying on. i was meditating for about 30 minutes when all of a sudden i was forced to think about aliens. i had not gone into this meditation with any of this possibly on my mind already, so i was curious. an energy in my head pulled my thoughts towards their direction (north of me) until i finally opened my eyes and witnessed a craft hovering over some pine trees about 200 feet away from my location. it flew towards me, then shot west without and maneuvering. i couldn't see where it went, but then it reappeared right above the same trees it originally appeared to me above. both times it seemed as if they had guide lights colored white and red on the front of the craft. it slowly moved toward me again, but this time as it crossed over my head i had the urge to snap my fingers. i reached up, snapped my fingers, and immediately a huge beam of light come over me. i remember being excited and thinking \"beam me up scotty\" in an excited tone, but i don't remember actually being beamed up. what i do remember was three people who looked like humans observing me. i feel like they were mentally connecting with me in order to do this because i don't know how else i would have seen them with such detail in that light. they were white skinned people dressed in government looking uniform. there was one lady and two men. they never once were nice or smiled, they just seemed to want to see who was able to mentally attract them. a few days later i went and tried to meditate again during the day. i had an overwhelming negative energy bombard me that completely made me stop meditating for 2 years. i slowly have worked my way into meditation again and feel i have much more guard up now in case something of the sort were to happen again. i have slowly become a healer again, but not as proficient as i was back then. last week i had a healing from a reiki master that made me recall more of what happened. i remember after the ship leaving, i ran frantically down the hill screaming and crying. i got to the bedroom i was staying in and felt panicky and continued to cry until i went to sleep. i did not remember when i woke up that i had a scary encounter. i had thought to myself, maybe it was a dream, but if not, at least i'm okay. i thought maybe they were nice. i was never able to put the negative energy bombardment and the aliens in the same context. i thought maybe i opened my third eye too fast and that happened to slowly down my path, but i was never neither allowed nor able to connect the two together. i firmly believe i was in shock for the last 7 years and could not recall the situation properly. i now know inside of me that energy was cast by them to deter me from accessing my mental powers. i used to have complete control over my breath before that as well, and could never remember to mindfully take full breaths again until i remembered the rest of the story and realized that i had allowed them to take something from me. i immediately felt my healing powers come back and i breathe the way i had taught myself in the 10 months prior to my encounter. this is my story, and its all i remember so far. something tells me that the beam and the apparition of these people is all i remember, but not all that happened. now that i can recall how terrified i was leaving that hill, i trully believe and feel that there was more to the story that i cannot access in my memory. my dog had stayed with me throughout the whole encounter as well. i remember him being calm, as if he had no idea they were there.","distance":"21-100

my patio with a friend just enjoying the night and talking. it was a very clear sky and the stars were bright and pretty. my friend had gone in for a drink or used the bathroom so i was still out just looking at the stars. as i kept staring to the right of the sky i noticed two stars that were glistening with orange tint to them when the one started moving to the left slowly. i was not scared or freaking out because i do believe in ufos and definitely now after my sighting, but at the time i was not sure what i was seeing. so the \"orange star\" was going across to the left still high up in the sky when it stops and is still for some seconds maybe and then the \"star\" starts moving straight down and as its doing that it is growing in size since its gettint closer. at that time im yelling for my friend to come out and see this. i did not try to use my phone because i was thinking the flash would make it leave or something. my friend comes out and is watching with me at this time now and we are both sayin what is that? so to me it was just an orb that was glowing and it stopped and stood still. my distance calculations are not good so i can only guess it was a little higher than the tallest tree of my back yard at the time. behind my yard is a cemetery then a road and then a river. i am not sure if the orb was over the cemetery or possibly over the river since its in the sky. i go in and run upstairs to grab my binoculars and try to get a better view from my bathroom window upstairs but even with the binoculars all i could see is an orange glowing globe. the other orange orb stayed afar still looking like a star but did move around and was gone. i run back downstairs and go back out and its still out there. my guess is 5 minutes from me spotting the orb till it's gone. then it goes straight up pretty fast and i do not recall any noise. once it reaches a certain high point it stops and then shoots off to the direction i first spotted it and then its gone. i was like wow that is crazy what just happend. it was not a plane and definitely not a helicopter. the only people i ever told is my family. my only regret is not using my camera on my phone.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I grew up on a small rural farm in paris township, kenosha wisconsin. i remember several things occurring from 1987 when we moved to the farm until the summer of 1994 when i left for college. these incidents cover that time period, however, i can’t recall exact dates. much of this i thought of as a dream until facebook came along and an old friends contacted me saying something like, “hey, do you remember…”\r\n\r\nface in the window:\r\n\r\nit was around new years and my parents were away from the house at a party. my brother was at a friends and i had a friend over to work on a 10-page government report due when we got back from winter break later that week. i’d guess the incident occurred at around 9:00 pm and probably between december 30 and january 1. i was likely a sophomore or junior in high school so it would have been either 1991-1993. there was a large front porch on the front of our house and due to it being winter we never used the front door because the front of the house faced fields and the wind would sweep snow drifts onto the porch. so we always used the side-door which led to the driveway. however, if you stand on the porch near the front door there was a picture window looking into our dining room and at the end of the dining room was a large desk with a computer. \r\nmy friend had just finished the paper. we both stood up at the same time and turned toward the window. staring at us from the window was a face. i recall it being whitish/grey, and it seemed as if the skin was smooth like warm candlewax. it’s head was longer than a human, and slightly more bulbous, but not in an exaggerated way. its eyes were dark and maybe three or four times the size of a typical human. while the description sounds like a stereotypical “grey” alien, it also seemed different. in fact, different enough for me to think it was something else other than an et until recently. anyway, it was staring and in the few seconds i saw it i remember feeling as if it wanted to hurt me, was upset with me, or needed to get to me and was upset it couldn’t. i didn’t hear anything, and i remember thinking that those were feelings i felt deliberately from this creature. it wasn’t fear, although i was terrified. about the same time that my friend and i dove to the floor i saw the creature turn it’s head and run toward the driveway. from my position he ran to the left. \r\nafter about five minutes my friend and i had convinced ourselves that what we’d just seen was a neighbor messing around with some kind of a mask. however, when i walked my friend out to his car we realized that there were no footprints in the snow – and there was snow everywhere from the porch to the driveway. i don’t recall ever seeing the creature again. \r\nin my early thirties facebook came around. by this time, even though i vividly remembered that night, i started to think it might have been a dream. one day i received a message from my friend after connecting on facebook. one of the first things he said to me was “hey do you remember that night at your house when we saw that thing?”\r\n\r\nlights at night: \r\n\r\ni think this incident occurred before i was in high school, so it was probably between 1987-1990. our closest neighbors with kids lived ¼ mile down the road and one of the kids was camping with me and maybe my brother in our side yard which was about a half-acre piece of land behind our 3-car detached garage and then bordered on the side by two large grain bins at least twenty feet tall and an old barn. \r\ni woke up in the middle of the night because i saw a really bright light shining into our tent. at first, i thought maybe a farmer had pulled up near the barn to turn around and had their bright lights shining on the tent. i wanted to see who it was so i crawled out of the tent and as soon as i was out of the tent the light was gone. it wasn’t like someone pulled away or even flipped the lights off. it just wasn’t there. so, i got outside and walked onto the road and didn’t see any cars. it was really dark outside and i was heading back to the tent. but, before i got to the tent i saw several bright spherical lights. if i had to estimate, i’d say they were between a softball and bowling ball in size. there were several colors, although right now i only recollect red and yellow. initially they were hovering above me and the tent, about as high as the grain bins. then they began to move. sometimes they were in a circular pattern and then sometimes three would form a triangle maybe five to six feet long. i don’t recall how many lights there were, but i want to say it was around five. so, they would be in the triangle or circle formation and then suddenly break from each other and just move randomly all over the place, always above me, but in a lot of directions, before going back to their pattern together. \r\nthat’s all i remember and always thought it was a dream. it never occurred to me that the incident wasn’t a dream until, again facebook, when this kid, contacted me and asked if i remember the night we were camping in my yard and saw those strange lights by the old barn and bins. i knew he’d had been camping with us, but i don’t recall him seeing the lights with me which was especially haunting for me. \r\n\r\ntime loss:\r\n\r\nmy friend and i were hanging out at my house. it was about noon and we were talking about something and decided to go for a walk down the street. we would have said “up the hill and back.” there was a dip in the road and then the road went up a hill.” we would often walk it when we were bored or talking about something. this was probably the same time period as the lights, between 1987 and 1990 and it was in the summer because i remember wearing a t-shirt. \r\nmy dad asked us where we were going, and i told him just up the hill and back. he said not to be gone for too long, although i don’t remember why. he and i walked up the hill and back. it was at most 15 minutes. but, when we got back my dad was furious and said he was about to call the police since we’d been gone so long. had he not looked so mad i would have thought he was joking. then he said my friend had to get home because either his grandma or mom was freaking out and kept calling. i used to wear a watch back then and looked at it. only about fifteen minutes passed so i was even more confused, but, when i got inside the house all the clocks were almost four hours later than my watch. \r\ni remember going up and down the hill countless times that summer with my friend trying to figure out what happened and neither of us could. thinking about it that was probably the summer of 1989 or 1990, because my friend and i stopped hanging out shortly after that. \r\nflashing lights:\r\nit was nighttime, probably around 9:00 pm in the summer. i can’t recall which year, but probably 1989-1993. i was with friends, but i can’t recall who. what i do remember is looking off toward the north probably about 85 degrees off the horizon to directly above us and we could see flashing in the sky. they looked like exploding fireworks without noise and without the streaming. the lights were all white and only looked like a quick explosion. \r\nmy friends and i ruled out fireworks because, except for the visual explosion there was nothing similar. plus, they were so high in the sky and they were about the size of the stars before the exploded and moved. \r\nwe could actually see what looked like a star, then it would explode, but also seem to move to another area of the sky and explode again, move to another area of the sky and explode again. they continued in these strange moving patterns for what seemed like forever, but was probably only ten minutes. \r\nthe next day i described it to my dad who said it must have been the aurora borealis, which was sometimes viewable, but nothing like this. since then i have searched online and haven’t been able to find anything like it. i only recall seeing this once.\r\n\r\ndreams:\r\n\r\nalong with these incidents, i also had a series of dreams, which unto themselves i wouldn’t think were anything more than dreams. in fact, until i started thinking about the old farm recently i still just thought they were dreams. however, after listening to an audiobook on an alien abduction i thought i would at least mention them. for transparency, i should say that as i kid i did believe in ufos and ets. i wasn’t obsessed, but if i saw something on tv i’d watch it and occasionally look at the sky hoping to see something. \r\ni only remember fragments of the dreams. the thing that made these dreams different from other dreams is i always woke up somewhere outside my bed and often outside of our house. \r\none example is a dream i had about a ufo that was on the ground in our driveway. it was more of a “pod” of some sort, and saucer-shaped. it might have been only ten feet wide and i remember thinking that it was way too small for me or anything else to fit inside. it was probably only three to four feet at it longest from top to bottom.\r\ni remember a typical grey alien of some kind, but i don’t remember our contact as much as i remember it being irritated with me for doing something. but, i don’t know what. it wasn’t mad, but more like a parent is irritated with a toddler. at some point the saucer was flying around and i was with it, but then it was on the ground again and i was left on the ground. when the dream was over i woke up alone on our driveway in the middle of the night. \r\nanother dream i recall was something about these hooded creatures and a tall uncloaked figure in my bedroom at night. i woke up because i was floating, but unable to control anything. i could only see and hear. the sound i heard was a light droning or humming. my legs began moving through the bedroom wall that led to the back of our house and toward the farm fields. \r\nthe next thing i recall is walking by myself in the middle of the night along a trail. our farm had our house, behind that was a field and then a large garden, the animals (pigs, cows, goats) the bee hives and then a large soybean field we rented to other farmers. i was toward the back end between the bee hives and the pigs. i only remember this because the pigs’ grunting seemed to wake me up while i was walking. \r\ni remember dreams of a figure in my bedroom doorway multiple times, as well as the feeling of moving without seeing anything. other places i woke up were at the bottom of the stairs alongside the book case, our front porch and several times outside – often behind the garage and near the grain bins where i had seen the colored orbs. \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

wife and i were on our way to the kroger at the corner of delk road and powers ferry rd se in marietta, georgia. my wife was driving and i was in the passenger's seat. we were making our way north up powers ferry road. we stopped at a red light at the terrell mill/powers ferry road se intersection. as we were stopped at the red light i looked over to the traffic lights on the right to see when that traffic light would turn from green to red. at that moment i noticed the object. it looked like a solid white stationary light to me. i wasn't sure what it was so i didn't mention it to my wife at first. as the traffic light started to change the white lights of the object started to flash on and off. that is when i mentioned it to my wife. at first she didn't see it, but she noticed it a little further down the road. both of us had no idea what the object was. at this point i thought the object was flashing on and off. my wife described the object as disappearing and reappearing. i have a dash cam in my car so i turned the camera toward the object. with my eye the object appeared to have at least three square lights i could see that were in a horizontal row. they were turning on and off in a sequential chase pattern and then a flashing pattern. around this time my wife and gotten into the middle lane and was concerned with traffic. we sat stationary for a little while and observed the object before turning into the kroger parking lot. looking back in the direction of the object we could no longer find the object. as we parked i went and took my dash cam and went through to see if i caught the video on my dash cam. once we got back home i was able to grab the video from my dash cam and upload it to my computer. the video shows that the object first appears around the 16 second mark into the video. my particular dash cam is a vantrue r2, and the video it recorded was in 2k resolution. the dash cam also time stamped the video however the time is ahead by an hour as i hadn't remembered to reset the time after daylight savings had ended earlier in the month. this event took place november 20th, 2017.

mexico. we departed ensenada at about 6pm en route for los angeles,this was the final evening of our cruise.\r\nafter dinner and a show in the ships main theater the wife and i retired to our cabin. as i entered the cabin the first thing i did was open our balcony door and step outside onto the balcony. i had been standing on the balcony for about a minute when i looked to the sky and observed what i fully believed to be an airplane,at this same time my wife came onto the balcony and joined me. i pointed to what i believed was the airplane i was observing and told my wife \"we haven't seen many of those lately, just as my wife started looking at this \"plane\" with me it split into two bright lights  and slowly both lights climbed in elevation in an arcing type trajectory, then both lights disappeared while at the same time four more lights appeared much lower in the sky in front of us in the distance. we then observed many lights all over the horizon in front of us that would switch position in the sky instantaneously, some were low on the horizon and some were high, the color of these lights would vary but were for the most part a yellowish golden orange, neither my wife nor myself have ever seen that color. these lights would move instantaneously from one part of the sky to the next,suddenly all the lights disappeared and directly in front of us we observed three red lights on the horizon sitting at a 45 degree angle, no craft was visible only these three lights, i could not tell you if these lights were 100 feet away or a mile away,those lights then disappeared. the entire event lasted about four minutes and during this time we witnessed several of these lights/orbs move at incredible instantaneous speeds from one spot to another. what has compelled me to report this was i was watching a cable news network show tonight and they had a guest on the show that was the fighter pilot of the plane that caught an unidentified object on camera, the story was released by the n.Y. times this week and the video of this pilot and the object has gone viral.The pilot explained that this incident occurred 13 years ago off the coast about 100 miles south of san diego between san diego and ensenata, that is exactly where we had our sighting nov 8th 2017.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and the spheres hovered for about 2 minutes. my husband was driving and we had stopped at the beginning of the driveway and just watched in disbelief. all of a sudden, the spheres went vertical into the sky and accelerated into the clouds, at about a 45 degree angle.  my husband and i looked at each other and said,\"did you see what i just saw?\" my 11 year old son saw the balls of red and green light because we had the sun roof opened at the time and he was scared. i tried to reassure him that it wasn't anything but i wasn't quite sure what we had seen either.  i have not been able to reconcile what we saw that night with anything that made sense.  i told friends what i saw and they said it was landing lights from a plane.  the problem with that theory is that you would have heard a plane but what i saw was absolutely silent and they hovered.  they also moved in a way that a plane never could have moved.  i just wanted to tell someone who may believe in ufos because that is the only thing that fits the description of what i saw. i am a fairly logical person and what i saw that night defies logic, as we know it today.  i was not scared when i had the sighting, more like

incredible speeds . i felt like once they noticed me looking at them they started leaving faster , it was incredible . after the sighting a big bold very large orb flew over head , scared my wife to death . she was freaked . i didn’t feel like it was a bad sighting i felt like they wanted to be seen and i didn’t get any negative feelings from this . although i have had about 3-5 sightings in my life this was the first one ever i saw a fleet move in formation . and the way they light up and just moved at the speed of light into space was something i’ll never forget. even when i first walked my dog i didn’t look up until one of them made a huge flash like almost they wanted to get mine or anyone’s attention. it made my wife a biliever and that for me was a huge plus , this world is incredible . we only see 100% of the light spectrum 90% of our world we can’t see . so maybe i saw an exhaust from a ship my eyes can’t see i don’t know but it was sirius enough that i wanted to

what the f*** is that?\" and directed my attention towards the south right above the tree line. there was a large,  triangular object moving like nothing i have ever seen, or can even comprehend. it seemed to be descending, and shifted back and forth on the x and y axis before moving in one direction in a \"glitchy\" manner. my heart was racing and i had a small panic attack as we tried to follow it and  it disappeared behind the tree line. it was difficult enough to comprehend what i was looking at, but it seemed like a large 2 dimensional, asymmetrical triangle at a tilted angle with greenish lights on each corner, moving at a very strange angle, that looked physically impossible. my friend and i have experienced something that we thought was a ufo in the same area about a month earlier and we were joking about it no more than an hour before the event. after event, we returned to the place that we first saw the craft and attempted to elaborate what we had seen. the helicopter

saw what appeared to be 3 stars in a triangular shape moving slowly se from my location. after a second i could see a very dim outline of the craft, showing straight edges. at each corner was an extremely white, bright light, with one of them at the front of the object. appeared to be very high in the sky, around zone of commercial air traffic. watched for about 1 minute and then noticed a commercial jet flying toward the object from the east. as the commercial jet approached the object either turned off one light at a time or suddenly shot upward out of sight, not sure which. it was gone after that. also please note that while filling out this form my computer went instantly dead for about 5 minutes. the object appeared to be massive in size, like city size for the height it was
