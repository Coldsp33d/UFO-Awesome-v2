States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in the backyard grilling food before a july 3rd fireworks display in the meridian ranch community of falcon, co. it had just turned dark - but with well-defined light contrast between open sky and cloud cover. at 9:15pm (15 minutes prior to the display start time) i saw what appeared to be an unusually neon red/red-orange object directly to the west. i do not recall how the object initially appeared... it seems from my memory like it came out of the cloud cover. the sky was mostly clear by this time - just after a large rain and lightning storm had passed - but there was a distinctly dark area of low level cloud still present in the north-west region of the sky - not too far away from my location. at the southerly edge of this cloud cover is where the object first appeared.\r\n\r\ni noticed the object easily because of its bright red lighting against the early night sky. the lights captivated me because they were hard to discern in shape - appearing to at times consist of two very closely positioned red orbs - not like a red light on a typical helicopter or plane. i knew it was not a plane - because it was mainly static in location. it was also on my side of the cloud cover - so not a plane in the distance coming toward me. it was silent as well - no blade noise of any kind in the distance - and the style of hovering was too odd to strike me as a helicopter. i honestly did not know what the object was. the color was somehow more intense against the sky as well  - and the lights where larger - not like typical safety lights. the shape seemed to change to some degree - but the distance made it difficult to clearly observe. there was also a green element - perhaps a third light of its own that was clearly a distinct part of the object. the green light seemed to very subtly trail (or elongate) when the object moved horizontally in its opposite direction. \r\n\r\nthe object was initially moving very slightly while hovering - so not perfectly static - but very close to it. it then drifted a short distance to the north, and then back a little to the south - maybe all within the width of half of a rooftop from my vantage point. it seemed to be only a few miles away - if that. if i were to guess - i would say it was no further west than the area of black forest road and maybe 1 to .5 mile(s) south of the black forest tree line. \r\n\r\ni knew this was potentially out of the ordinary and became a bit excited by the unusual characteristics. i called through the sliding door to my other two family members to hurry and observe it. once they arrived - i had them record it with their iphones - but the lighting was very poor for video capture from this distance. while the three of us observed the object - it seemed to move slightly to the north before it then suddenly descended. it descended straight down vertically - and in an easing manner - but at a decent rate of decent. we lost it for a moment behind neighboring rooftops. we observed it again perhaps 10-20 seconds later, when it appeared a rooftop or two more to the north, and ascended back up to just beneath the low lying cloud layer. \r\n\r\nat this time, my family members where commenting on its unusual nature as well, saying it was definitely odd - not ordinary. i should also mention that at this time there was no longer any element of green to the lighting of the object - and i never saw that again during this sighting. only red - and perhaps now - from memory - a subtle element of white - but mainly red and for the most part - no pulsing or blinking anymore. that was all in the initial part of the observation. the object then moved across our visual field to the north and descended out of view again. \r\n\r\nthe fireworks display had just started - and we got a little distracted - and my food was needing some attention - so the others opted to go sit in front of the house to watch. i went out ahead of them (leaving the food to grill a few minutes longer) and checked the sky above the house to see if the object was visible. sure enough - it was hovering stationary at about 75-80 degrees just north of our house - definitely over the neighborhood at this point. i would guess it was maybe 500 ft over head - but hard to tell, not knowing its size. it was below cloud cover though - and that was pretty low (we live at around 7100 ft – so clouds are often very low to ground level). it felt as if the object was observing - leading to a brief discussion of perhaps government security presence for the event - but that made no sense. it was a minor event and the object was totally silent. there were moments between fireworks that were completely still/silent - and there was no discernible prop or engine noise at all. the object was also perfectly static – all with red lights only – perhaps three now visible (from memory). i asked my family to record it again from this perspective. then the object drifted at moderate speed back out of view to the northwest of my house - more towards the original location and along the westerly underbelly of that cloud layer.\r\n\r\nmy family stayed to watch the fireworks display - but where kind of silent and distracted. i ran back (into the backyard) to remove the food from the grill quickly - and to keep observing the object in the northwest sky. to my surprise - there where now 2 objects! both identical in appearance previously described. the second object was further north than the original - which was now hovering static, northwest under the cloud clover - probably just above the southern black forest tree line - and east of black forest road. the more northerly object was also just under the same cloud cover and seemed to be working in unison with the other object - both appearing to hover in an observation position. i ran upstairs, grabbed my android phone, and took a photograph of this positioning from my bedroom window. now of course - i understand why videos and photos are so frustratingly poor most of the time. phones are not great at night time or distance capture. this required both. most of us aren't running around with filters and dslr cameras with zoom lenses tripods on us - which would really have made my photo and our videos look much more impressive, close, and clear. visually - these red objects where very clear and painfully obvious in the sky.\r\n\r\ni ran out to the front once more - attempting not to neglect my family during the fireworks show - but i couldn't stay seated long. i did observe one of the objects descend once more - while pointing them out to a passerby on the side walk - and he observed it as well (with another friend) from a vantage point between some roof tops - and thought it very odd also. he flippantly mentioned it being a government drone - but again - to sport bright red lighting would be counter intuitive. and i doubted the government would waste time/money droning our small community event. plus - they objects appeared to be too large to me - and the colors - with the strange green element originally - nothing conventional seemed to make sense. \r\n\r\ni last saw the objects back in their northwest and further north positions - along the west edge of that strip of low, thin cloud layer (the brighter night sky allowed this to be easily discernible). i spent some time watching the grand finale with my family - then returned to find the objects where gone.\r\n\r\nthis entire event easily spanned 30 minutes - possibly 40. frustratingly, no one else in the neighborhood appeared to be looking in that direction at all. the fireworks where to the southeast of the community - launched from the golf course club house area - so everyone had been attentively facing the opposite direction in oblivious fashion.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

in the sky coming towards birmingham international airport on interstate i-59 south. i assumed just a plane or helicopter but has we passed the airport and came closer to our exit i then noticed it hovering over our exit. i stopped in middle of interstate in the right lane of interstate and turned on my flashers on and turned off my radio. i then rolled down my driver side window and pulled my head out and looked up and it was so close above us. there was no wind or noise. i then opened my door and had my left foot on the pavement and left side of my body out of the car and to observe better view than trying to look out my windshield as was when first stopped the car. so i am half way out of the car with left side of my body and i look up and the white lights were so bright i could barely see the object outline. there were 3 white bright lights in triangle formation with a bright red light in the middle. there was no noise or down draft or wind, nothing was moving. it was just hovering there. i then decided to get off the exit, but not the one we were suppose take. the exit was a short sharp turn to the right. this exit was exactly next to where i had stopped on the interstate (paralle). the outline of what i saw of othe object while on the interstate was black i believe from what i could tell through the bright white lights. as i stated the exit i took was right next to where i stopped on the freeway. i looked up and it was completely gone. i did not see or hear it leave (no noise during entire encounter). it only took less than 5 seconds to take this exit from the freeway and make the sharp right turn off the freeway. my ex-husband thought it was a helicopter but did agree with exactly what i saw in my description and felt some helicopters do not make any noise. he did agree with hovering, no noise or wind. i suppose he wanted to rationalize what he had seen. however for me i know it was not a helicopter because it was hovering above us so close to

the subdivision was called honey lake . just a decade ago the land was under water and was part of the everglades. broward county was in the midst of an explosion of homes being built out west.\r\nhoney lake is about 12 miles due west from port everglades and the fort lauderdale airport.\r\n\r\nthe local news reported that the aircraft carrier uss nimitz was coming to port but was to large of a ship to dock at the port. it's was to be anchored 3 miles off shore you had to take a tender if you wanted to see the ship for a tour. \r\n\r\nsighting :\r\n\r\nthe sky was bright blue with some clouds. it was sunset around 6 pm, and i was outside walking my dog barney, the neighborhood kids were playing down the street when i heard them yelling to look up. some of the kids were calling to their parents to come outside and see what was in the sky.\r\nas i looked to the west i saw a very large almond shaped craft. it was lit up by the background of the sunset.\r\nthe object was extremely large. i could see lights passing thru the middle of the object.\r\nit was headed in a west south west direction deeper over the everglades . \r\n\r\nthe object was moving very slow. it was too far away to hear any noise, but i would say it was about 30deg above the horizon . the size of it was more than 1 mile across. it was about 7 to 10 miles away . i watched it move a cross the sky for over 10 minutes.\r\nthe sun had set, the sky was very orange and the object was very clearly outlined by the orange sky line. it was no cloud. i could see light running back and forth in the middle of the object. not lightning\r\nit was huge. if you took joe robbie football stadium, and placed it in the sky it would be dwarfed by the size of the unknown craft. it looked very much like the craft in the movie independence day . note (the movie had not been made before my sighting). when i saw the movie in the theater i said to my self omg that's the closest thing i have seen to it!\r\nas it was getting darker the craft continued moving west and out of sight. at that time i could hear jets above my head. i saw two f 14 streak across the sky less than 1000 feet, headed in the same direction towards the unknown craft.  about 5 min later i saw three all black military helicopters less than 1000 feet above the ground headed in the same direction. possibly blackhawks . \r\ni knew that the air craft carrier was anchored off port everglades and assumed that's were the military craft came from.\r\n\r\nin closing \r\nthe size of the craft was huge ! living in south florida we have the goodyear blimp. you can see it in the sky, what i saw was no blimp or air plane.\r\nyears later after watching many ufo topic shows i see where many eye witnesses have came forth about the black helicopters chasing ufo, my story sounds the same.\r\ni am not looking for anything. i know what i saw !\r\nbut what bothers me why no media made note of it, no tv ,radio or news paper, i can only tell you that many south  floridian had to see it there was no way you could not see it.\r\nit's my story i lived it \r\ni am a retired broward sheriff deputy of 28 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

noticed a white and red light hovering where i have never seen lights hover before. i happen to have my binoculars in my hand from checking out the moon a few minutes before. when looking through the binoculars i could clearly see a bright white orb with red lights flashing behind it in the shape of a cylinder. i ran inside the house to wake my boyfriend. he came out and we both watched it for approx. 7 minutes as it hovered there. from where we were standing in our back yard the bright white orb light was to the left and the red flashing lights extended off to the right. the length of the cylinder shape coming off of the orb was approx. 7 to 8 times the size of the orb. the red flashing lights appeared to me as though it was scanning something. it then turn abruptly with the bright white orb facing down and descended somewhere on the morongo indian reservation. when the object had descended out of site i looked to the east where a plane was coming from palm springs area. as we watched this plane come closer to us a streak of light went flying across the sky at an incredible speed. it looked like a shooting star except for the fact that it was an aqua bluish color. we came back into the house at that time and i came to this site to make a report.  as i was writing this report i stepped out side to see if it had come back up from where it appeared to have landed. my boyfriend went outside with me. the original object was not seen, however at that moment what appeared to be a plane with flashing lights was flying from the west to the east over the area were the first object had been spotted, when i looked through the binoculars it was not a plane. the object appeared to be round, light bluish color with flashing silvery looking lights. no sound as it cruised over the area of the previously seen object, and continued on east ward. these objects were between a mile to 2 miles from our home. sky was clear. i am shaky as i type this. i have see a extremely large black triangle object approx. 8 months ago. i did not report it at the time. i had written info down that i was going to submit but never got around to it. what i felt tonight was completely different from what i felt then. when the black triangle glided past and blocked out the entire sky i had to wake my boyfriend to come out on the couch to sleep while i watched tv (which i rarely watch). that episode made the hair on my neck stand straight up. tonight/this morning i am a little giddy. not afraid of this object in the least. asked my boyfriend if we could drive over closer. he said no. so there you have it. what i experienced over the last hour/hour and a half. i don't own a cellphone and my boyfriend had just woken up and did not have his on him. we were both in awe of

to the public, over the hills behind the rock quarry in the hills over the bull run water shed. we came around a corner and there it was, in the air. big as a house, directly overhead. close and covering much of the sky. we sat there for a few minutes in the truck. stunned. then we both got out of the truck and stood there for i have no idea how long. we didn't even talk, really. we just stared at it. everything was absolutely silent. no birds, no sound at all. so bizarre. then after, what, 20 minutes? an hour? i don't know, but after a very long time it started to move, very slowly, and still so silent. we watched it move toward the watershed and we watched it move down and over the treetops, silently toward the next hill. over the hill and gone. \"wtf,\" said my boyfriend. i didn't know what to say. we got back in the truck and decided to head to our friend's home to tell them about it. we got to their house and they were out so we drove home. \r\n\r\nthe weirdest thing is neither of us thought about it again until the following weekend at someone's home. a girl said something about ufos and from across the room he and i caught each other's eye. holy crap. it hadn't crossed either of our minds over the week. how was that even possible? we talked about it a lot after that though. why we never even thought or talked about it for a week is just so strange. \r\n\r\nit was a disk, silver with two kind of yellowish lights. one seemed like a power source, pointing toward the ground but it didn't light the ground up. like you could see a beam of light but it didn't light anything up. and then round lights all around the bubble kind of top. it looked like what you see in the movies, a round disk with a top surrounded by lights. \r\n\r\ni've never written

this is my first report and my first time witnessing something completely unexplainable to my mind. i am an analytical person. i never thought i would see something i would be so dumb-founded over. it was may 30th/2015 and i was on my front landing at about 1am. a bright orb, which at first looked like any other satellite in the sky. it was tracking from the se of me down towards the horizon and moving a bit faster than a normal satellite, after i thought about it for a second. the object stopped then emitted a beam of light that looked like moonlight and coned to the ground. after i guess a couple of seconds it stopped the light and proceeded to move to the west. when it did that i  noticed another object to its west, now moving towards the first object(towards the east). the second object was a bit dimmer but it was closer to other light sources like the almost full moon and venus, than the first object. the two objects then moved around each other in an oval shape, the first object doing a semi circle under the second object as the second did the same move only above. both objects then vanished. the whole incident took only perhaps 15 seconds. i was unable to take any photos or video as the time was so short and i was not looking for ufo's. i always thought people just had too much imagination or are nuts or want attention. i am none of those things and am actually hesitant to report without any evidence but my brother in ontario said he heard that the us government had reported that they were doing testing of some kind over the pacific north west, near the border with canada on that night and that others had seen something but i don't know about any of that and have not seen any reports nor have i actually tried to research what i saw. i thought maybe if i just report it that i might learn more and not look at anything before then that might influence my thoughts on all this. i enjoy some of the shows you do and i think it is good that people are checking into things that are too real to be explained by weather events or balloons. i have been out looking and seen nothing more, however i do have a camera ready now, just in case. if possible i would love to hear if what i saw was reported by anyone else and if there is recorded evidence that would lend credence to what i saw, because it did not look like anything man made. i do have a sketch but i believe my description is accurate and prefer not to submit anything at this time. thanks and happy searching, j

associate saw the following:\r\nin late october of 2009 witness saw 6 bright, silver metallic orbs flying in a perfect arrow formation. the sixth one momentarily broke off formation and then rejoined the group. the formation was very precise. the silver orbs were about the size of basket balls. they were flying low about 100 feet off the ground or very high tree tops. witness went inside the business and got second witness who also saw the orbs. \r\n\r\ntwo days later, at the same location, at 2 am, witness saw a \"rose bowl sized\" translucent sphere. it seemed invisible, but witness could see an outline around it. witness went inside and got a very bright blue crystal flashlight and signaled in morse code \"hi can you see me\". witness walked back toward building and was facing red hill ave. the sphere came toward him and stopped overhead. it had a light beneath it that reminded witness of a setting sun, colored yellow and oranges, very bright and then getting dimmer and dimmer.\r\nwhile it was overhead witness was frozen, scared, and felt a heat/energy over his body like \"being lite up like a christmas tree\". he felt a huge/odd pressure in his head. when the light on the sphere dimmed it shot straight up into the sky and disappeared. after it was gone he had no idea what time or day it was, his watch had also stopped. \r\n\r\nwitness says he saw hundreds of the translucent spheres in the direction of the ocean, making impossible turns no normal aircraft could make. he could only make out the outlines of them. witness also saw two massive triangles also translucent in the same area to the south toward the ocean from the business where he worked.\r\n\r\nwitness has been hearing odd frequencies in his head, starting softly in his left ear going to his right ear and and getting louder and louder until dissipating. \r\n\r\nwitness does not have tinnitus, witness is a drummer and has taken precautions to prevent hearing damage. \r\nwitness does not take any medication, does not drink alcohol or do any drugs and is healthy.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
