understand.  i figured that i should report it though, in case it is ever useful to future researchers.\r\n\r\ni was very young, between ten and twelve years old, and i had fallen asleep on the couch in the living room.  i do not remember the exact sequence of events, but the following occured:\r\n\r\n- the tv went to static and woke me from the couch, so i turned it off\r\n- the tv was off, but turned itself on and went to loud static\r\n- there was a bright light in the backyard visible in the living room\r\n- i woke up sprawled out on the stairs between the main floor and the second floor with no idea how i got there, i made a lot of noise - talking and maybe even shouting (i don't remember exactly, just the impression i have now) and then lost consciousness\r\n- i woke up in my bed with no idea how i got there, and then lost consciousness\r\n\r\nthis series of events ended when i came to consciousness sitting on the toilet in the bathroom on the second floor.  i had no idea how i got there, and had total amnesia.\r\n\r\nthis was very strange, because i had memories of coming from a totally different place, on a table, in a cavern, surrounded by strange beings, who told me that i had a different name than the one i was born with.  after they released me, i returned to my body, then slid into it from the right with no memory of who the body was, or where it was.\r\n\r\nthen i picked up on the earth, i knew i was on earth, so i repeated that to myself \"i am on earth\".  then i got the country \"i am on earth in the united states\", then i got a state, city, street name, street address, first name, last name, and then recovered my full memory.\r\n\r\ni felt very ill.  as if i had been placed in an oven and my insides cooked.  my guts and intestines felt hot to me.\r\n\r\nthe next morning, i showed no signs of illness, and went to school.  \r\n\r\nit was a very surreal experience, and i was shaken from it for several months.  there was nobody that i could tell though, so i just figured that it was a weird dream.\r\n\r\nit is also interesting to note that i must have moved around a lot during the night, but nobody ever woke up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit is also worth noting that this happened one other time, but without the amnesia.  a couple of months later, i was in the cavern, on the table, surrounded by strange creatures, and then i went back into my body, which was laying in bed.  it was the middle of the night.  after i woke up, i felt very ill, again, as if my insides were heated up.  \r\n\r\nimmediately after rising from bed i observed a transparent spider crawl across my desk, which i knew wasn't real.  i didn't know what i was seeing.  about five seconds later a real spider that looked exactly like the transparent spider crawled along the exact same path, with the exact same movements as the unreal transparent spider.  i threw an object at it, and struck it, or at least struck very near to it.  i couldn't find its body, so i assume that it ran away.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":67574,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.609696216296264,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07032015-0027","longitude":-104.91127020591871,"occurred":605667600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1435947348000,"summary":"Bright

it will all come together. my mother had finally become aware of chem trails which i had pointed out years prior only to hear her laugh at me and my conspiracy stuff. she was over the top with it in my opinion and every cloud she saw was suspect and became a lil boy cried wolf situation. i had run outside to look at what she was yelling about many times only to see stuff that wasn't anything special to me. well on april 23rd 2014 i was in my room working on music i was either making a beat or mixing a song not sure exactly but one of the two, my mom was downstairs outside our apartment taking pics of chem trails yelling and saying i have to come see this. i laughed saying nobody cares i've been telling people for years, but she persisted and got more frantic. her tone changed to where i heard the sound of my mom thinking i'm stupid and crazy if i don't believe her. so reluctantly i come outside, she says \"tell me you don't see that s*** in the sky they were just bouncing all over the place\" and the look on her face told me she really saw something. i look up and at first glance i didn't see them, i thought to myself that my mom had truly lost it. i say \"i don't actually what the hell are you talking about mom\" she stomped her foot, grabbed my hand and pointed to the south east looking over our complex. that's when i felt a feeling i've never felt before it was beautiful and scary yet weird and strange all at the same time with a bunch of relief because i am a believer. right before me were what looked like 4 stars in broad daylight, i couldn't believe it they were like mini sun's just chilling in the clear above my complex sorta in the shape of an offset square, you know like the lil dipper without it's handle. well i grabbed the binoculars from my mom cuz she couldn't find them with them and i look... that's when i was hit with a life changing moment!!! i saw what looked like a flying vimana spinning at a very fast rate and kinda wobbled like spinning a top. it looked like it was chrome i could see the sun reflecting off all it's edges and had red lights spinning in the opposite direction in the middle of it. i think that was from the speed it was spinning at kinda like seeing lug nuts on a big rig when you are driving by it on the freeway trucks wheels are moving forward but the lug nuts look like they are going backwards. thats how the red lights looked and i actually could see that they were round red lights perfectly spaced apart. without the binoculars they looked like a set of stars hanging in the sky but were slowly spreading apart. i was shocked i can't even explain the feeling that went through my body except that i felt like a kid spying on their parents and saw something i wasn't supposed to see. i dropped the binoculars and ran upstairs as fast as i could and grabbed my phone so i could document what i just saw. i watch enough alien shows to know this had to be filmed and i hoped like hell they were still there. i come back outside and they are still there, but now the formation had spread apart and the bottom right one looked like it was moving further east and moving south at the same time. the square was stretched out and looked more like a triangle and so i just started filming. zoomed in all the way on my samsung galaxy s3, i wish i could've gotten it closer to show what i saw through the binoculars. now i totally understand why ufo footage is never that great, i actually had just gotten a dslr but it was in the shop that week! not to mention you just panic and kinda lose your senses a bit, i didn't know what to do i wanted to just sit there and watch it through the binoculars since it was so amazing but i knew i had to get footage of it and all i had was my damn phone. you can hear my reaction to it and my mom in the background asking if they were still there and a bird swoops by in one of the frames towards the end that gives a good distance ratio for the pro's. the footage is shakey since it's zoomed in at parts, i'm giving the raw video and one i cleaned up and slowed down when i zoom in because it's hard to see but they are there and i'm giving both files. nobody can explain this to me and anyone i have shown was a bit tripped out. i know what i saw through binoculars i'm not sure if all 4 looked the same up close i just locked on to one since it wasn't easy and what i saw shook me to my core that lil chrome thing was just spinning so fast. as for losing sight they just spread out a lil more and faded out and disappeared. my mother and i will gladly answer any questions that come out of this, she said that they were zipping back and forth above our apartments and that is what caught her attention and then they just froze in the position that i filmed them in. not sure what else to say this has bugged me for over a year now and i just had to send it to mufon because i caught something special and i know what i saw through binoculars...","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

along side the road. i noticed it around the 400 block of mt. zion rd. it was pretty high in the sky but not as high as a plane would be. that struck me as odd. i live near an airport and i see a lot of planes and helicopters. i noticed this light or orb because it had no blinking lights. i don't know how to explain it but it just kind of flew more smooth. it was just weird. i pulled out my cell phone and got a video of it but i was driving 20-25 mph and watching the road not the object so i could be safe. i stopped at a red light and found the object and recorded it. i have a 0:40 video of it but i had to trim 0:09 of the video to make it 0:31 and use a video compressing app on my phone to be able to attach the video to an email so that i can upload and save it to my desktop so i can upload it to this tool. i also uploaded it on my facebook page and tagged mufon the object didn't make a sound but i will say that there were obviously cars driving around me so its possible that any sound was drowned out and i couldn't hear it. i was heading home so i was trying to keep an eye on it and get to where i could stop my car. i finally turned left into florence baptist church and got out of my car and watched it. by now i had stopped recording as my phone isn't the best quality and i was having trouble seeing it. as i watched it seemed like it was flying and one second i see the light as plain as could and then its gone. it didn't fly behind anything it just seemed like it wasn't there. maybe turned its lights off or something. it just disappeared. the whole time i watched the object there were never any lights blinking. it was moving pretty fast because from the time i first saw it to when it disappeared was maybe 3 mins and it covered a lot of ground in that time. it was 70 degrees and humid outside with no breeze. i am using the temp gauge on my car for that info and i drove back to where i first saw it to get the exact location (400 block of mt zion road) and i looked at the clock.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

be too high and too large. it also was extremely stable in 'hover'. there was no wavering whatsoever. even helicopters move a little when they hover for extended periods.  i continued to watch for about 30 seconds more before calling my wife outside. when she arrived object was still stationary and exactly where i first saw it. to me, it appeared with two evenly sized and spaced red lights, blinking green light on left end, i saw blinking white (silver) light behind the two red lights. using letters to code the light colors, it looked like this to me:\r\n                         w/s\r\n

moved rapidly w then stopped. it then return e to it's original position (as near as we could tell). it stopped for about 5 seconds, then accelerated rapidly due n. we could not tell it it was loosing altitude as it moved off into the distance or went behind cloud cover. it could not have been a fixed wing aircraft. if it were rotary wing, it was faster than any helicopter i've ever experienced and we should have heard some kind of sound for such drastic maneuvering. we did not have our phones or a camera on our persons at the time. i can easily sketch what i
