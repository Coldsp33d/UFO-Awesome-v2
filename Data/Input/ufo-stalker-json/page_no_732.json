smaller stars came out of the large star which was remained stationary and then thess smaller stars became stationary and then smaller stars came out of them. then all of the stars except the main star started zig zagging around the big star like maybe if you had a large glass jar with bb's in it and you started shaking it as fast as you could, but one that was not a bb or a marble but a ping pong ball remained suspended in the middle not moving. i couldn't stop looking. i was mesmerized. we went in to get our parents but they were taling and sent us back out. later my cousins left an i went to bed. that week during bed time, my bed is right next to the window. i had an urge to look out. i say a face, angular, it looked like flakes where on it. it had yellow or green eyes. i jumped out of bed and ran out of the room to my parents. that same year until i started experiencing obe's. first i would hear a tone in my ear like a persistent note. i would focus on the sound and my brain would fell like it was vibrating faster and faster until  there was an explosion of light and then i was over my body and i could will myself to go where i wanted in the house and did. i also was able to see events in different locations miles and miles away in a trance like state, which often siezed me nightly. i could see and hear every thing but could not move. i say my fathers car plung into a river and the police and emergency vihicles, at the same time i say my mother scream out and arise from the bed hearing the radio of the wreck. all three events were tens of miles from each other. my uncle and mother are still alive and remember this, although i don't know if this started that night, because when i was an infant in a crib at my grandmothers house, may 5 or 6 months, i had a fever and i was above my body. i remember the conversation my mother and grandmother spoke to each other. when i told this to my mother for the first time when i was in my twenties she was stunned. my mother and i have a special communication between us. we call each other out of intuition or she will speak to me in a dream to contact her, sometimes she is in the form of someone in my immmediate environment. one time she was my college dean who came to my seat in a vision and said you need to call your mother. when my mother and i speak in instance such as these we do not even mention the

day) in calgary that were scheduled to be between 10:45pm and 11:45pm that day. they were being launched off the centre street bridge in calgary, so we decided to go to the sunnyside bank park and watch the fireworks from the top of the hill to get a good view (on crescent road nw near 2nd street nw). i remember looking at the time on my cell phone and at 10:51pm i made a comment to my wife that they were late with their fireworks. \r\n\r\nwithin a few minutes of that time the fireworks had started and they lasted approximately 15 minutes. once the fireworks finished, i waited for maybe 30 seconds to see if any more were coming, but all there was now was smoke above the centre street bridge. i looked at my cell phone again and the time was 11:09pm. i made another comment to my wife that they were liars, as i was expecting fireworks to last an hour. she laughed, and shortly after that she asked me \"what is that green light up there?\"\r\n\r\ni looked up in the sky and saw a green stationery star-like object in the sky hovering probably above centre street (not directly above us, just slightly east from us) and it was north of the centre street bridge. i don't know exactly how high it was, but it there was cloud cover and the object was still below the clouds. at that moment when i first saw it, i didn't know what to think, as it was stationery. in my mind i immediately related the light to some of the fireworks from before (although it was hovering and not rising and falling like a firework) or maybe a helicopter with a green light (i didn't hear any helicopter noise either, but the object was very high).\r\n\r\nthe object hovered in that spot for several seconds (10 to 20 seconds), then suddenly it shot off in the south east direction at a speed that i had never witnessed any airplane do before. it shot off several kilometers in the south east direction within 1 or 2 seconds, the came to a sudden  stop, and it hovered again for several seconds. my heart immediately jumped at that moments, as i suddenly knew that whatever this was, it definitely was not a firework, a helicopter or any other conventional aircraft known to me. \r\n\r\nthe light then suddenly vanished, as me and my wife started talking to each other in great excitement about what we just witnessed. the light appeared again, i reached for my cell phone to start recording, but as soon as i had the phone ready, the light vanished again, and we did not see it after that. \r\n\r\nwhen my wife first noticed the object, it was hovering lower, then it shot up with incredible speed and became stationery, at which point she drew my attention to it. i had missed the first part when it ascended, and i only saw it shoot horizontally across the sky. it was canada day fireworks and there were thousands of people scattered all around to watch the fireworks. \r\n\r\nmy wife, my 16 year old son and i all saw the object. the people standing behind us saw the object. since there were thousands of people present, i'm sure that many others saw the object. i hope that many more reports from that evening are filed, as i'm sure there are countless other witnesses to the event. \r\n\r\nit was just a light in the sky and if my wife had not pointed it out to me, i would have missed it. due to that fact, i'm sure that majority of the spectators did not see this light, but those that were looking up in the right direction would have seen it for sure.

famous lights over phoenix occurred and witnessed it first hand and, to me it just looked out of place for the phoenix sky line, my first thought was somebody rented stadium lights to maybe have a bar b q on top of south mountain. \"even at the time, i believed in ufo/aliens.\" but again i didn't and don't think the lights over phoenix were a ufo.\r\n i was born with a neurological disease nf1, it is a disease that causes tumors to grow on nerves, in 2009, i had a back surgery to remove a tumor. i really liked the neurosurgeon who did the surgery. then in august of 2013, one of the tumors in my leg was diagnosed as a malignant periphrial nerve sheath tumor a.K.A. sarcoma cancer. i had a c.T. scan and an m.R..I done. when i went to the neurosurgeon, \"keep in mind, this is a well respected neurosurgeon\"\r\nhe asked when i had surgery on my left ankle, i told him \"ive never had surgery on my left ankle\" he started laughing, made me pull down my sock to see if i had a scar, i don't. imaging showed two black screws in my ankle. dont know if they are,what they are,pr where they came from. anyway the neurosurgeon who tried to take as much of the tumor as he could but it was to little to late...I had to get my leg amputated. the oncologist i was referred to also asked about the screws in my ankle after viewing the image. the reason for my history brings me to last night,my encounter.\r\n i really dont know what time it was, between 130am and maybe 3am. i woke up from a state of sleep where you are just starting to dream. i am wide awake when i wake up, i know 110% i did not dream this. i woke to find a circle on my ceiling above the foot of my bed. it made a chirping noise like a cricket \"kinda\" accept there were no individual chirps, it was a consant noise. then i find myself trying to willingly elevate, i dont know why but thats what i did. i tried to call my wife who was sleeping on the couch with my son, but my voice wouldn't project the volume i needed it to, so i panicked. it was really very scary at that point, and i dont frighten very easily. after 3 or for minutes it just was gone. i didnt see a flight path it took to leave, it was just gone.\r\n on most nights, if i get up to use the bathroom i, put my prosthetic leg on. last night after this encounter i used my walker to go to the living room to check on my son and wife. they were fine. i wanted to look out the bedroom window but was hesitant. i was thinking to myself what if i was taken, so i started feeling my face for facial hair to see how much growth there was, there wasnt days worth, so i knew i wasnt taken but not convinced, then i remembered that last night \"july 1st\" was a full moon\" so i was hesitant but i looked out the window to see if it was still a full moon and it was.\r\n    theres a couple more things that may or not be relevant to this story, but i will share if i hear from somebody.

message. i was shaking to think what could happen to dallas, texas and i must act immediately. i was looking for other people as a witness. nobody was looking at the skies. i saw a couple of airplanes fly above me but they didn't seem affected. i waited a few more seconds thinking that this was the end of the message and then i saw the orb create a human face. i gasped and could hardly breathe. the message was intended for us. the orb disappeared. i decided to leave and send my information to

towards me from east to west. at the time there were planes taking off from d/fw airport from north to south which is their flight take-off path and this craft went right across the sky directly in their flight path. it seemed to be low in the sky as it came towards me so i was preparing to hear the sound of a helicopter but there was no sound at all even when it traveled directly in front and

off towards the town centre. you would imagine it to be over but no a black helicopter in the direction where the object shot off too  was flying over there for 10 minutes before the object came back

(we were off work for the summer. both my wife and i teach school now.) it was a perfect night so after the movie i decided to walk out onto our deck just to enjoy the night air.  my wife and son went outside too.  i was setting on our deck while my wife and son were setting on the porch.  i live in an extremely rural area and there are no loud sounds at night.  crickets, owls, etc. are all that are heard. i noticed a glowing \"orb\" hovering above the tree-line approximately two hundred yards away to my left.  the orb began moving from my left to right while still right above the tree tops.  as the orb came closer to my location i realized that i was not looking at a known object. i would describe the orb as being approximately the size of a basketball and it was yellowish colored with a green tint to it. the object appeared to be emitting a \"glow\" of energy that made the edges look fuzzy or more like small \"tentacles.\" as the orb continued moving toward my location it did not make any type of sound.  the orb did not \"flutter\" or move erratic; it was clearly on a distinct, direct path of travel and it was powered by some type of power source.  as the orb came closer to where i was setting (now only \"roughly\" 120 feet away) i started whispering to my wife and son \"come over here and look at this!\"  both my wife and son were ignoring me. (they did not see the object because they were setting on the porch, under the roof.) i then said louder, \"hey you two, come over here and look at this, this is crazy!\"  my wife said what are you talking about?\" i then said, \"over there, look!\"  i then abruptly pointed at the object.  as i pointed, it was as if the orb detected my movement.  the orb abruptly changed it's direction of travel and speed.  the orb immediately went straight upward into the night sky and disappeared into a cloud bank.  as soon as the orb disappeared, the entire night sky lit up like a huge firework and a loud, thundering \"boom\" sound was heard by all of us.  \r\n\r\ni told no one of the incident. however, approximately two months later (around september 2014) i was talking to my brother and he told me of a strange incident that happened to him during the summer also.  according to my brother, he and another man were leaving the woods after a deer scouting trip when an object very much like the one i had observed came up the \"hollow\" where they were standing.  according to my brother, he said the object continued to travel toward them and the closer it came, the more it descended in flight. my brother stated that he became startled because it looked as if the object was going to literally land on them.  my brother stated that when the object came to within thirty yard or so of them it was as if it detected their presence.  my brother stated that the orb abruptly changed directions and it flew up and away from them at an extremely high rate of speed before disappearing.  \r\n\r\nin june 2015 while at work a student was sharing an incident with my wife about what had happened to he and his mother recently. (this student had absolutely no idea about my incident.)  according to the student, he and his mother were \"coming back from a baseball game\" when he noticed a basketball sized orb that glowed yellowish green following them above the tree-line.  when they slowed to observe the orb, it accelerated it's speed and changed it's path of travel to avoid them.  \r\n\r\nmy wife told the student \"you have got to go tell my husband this.\"  the student walked down to my classroom and started relaying the encounter to me. (i had students in class at the time.)  after the student shared his account, i told him about what i had observed last summer.  during this time i had another student from my class (17 year old male) raise his hand and state, \"mr. kennedy, you are not going to believe this but i had the same thing happen to me this past year.\"  i then asked the student about his experience and according to the young man he stated that while his father, uncle and himself were out coon hunting this past fall they noticed a yellowish green orb following them as they walked through the woods.  according to the student, the orb continued to follow them from above as it hovered above the treetops.  the student said that the object followed them for well over two miles as they walked through the forest.  the student said that his uncle and father became so unnerved by the object following them that they began to shoot at it with a twelve gauge shotgun.  the student stated that the shotgun had no affect on the orb but it did turn and fly upward into the night sky and away from them after being shot at several times.\r\n\r\nthese individual encounters/events have all happened within a twenty square mile radius of each other.  three of the four encounters have happened within a five mile square radius of each other.  \r\n\r\nmy eye witness account did not frighten me, nor did i feel in danger, etc.  according to my brother, he was alarmed and the student stated that his uncle, father and himself were very frightened.

even been frightened. i wasn't as that was my 4th time seeing ufos. however, it was surprising, because there were planes in a close proximity. the objects didn't seem to move away or anything, so i thought that i was looking at venus and some other star which was close to it, so they looked like ufos. but then the objects moved north and continued hovering. by that time, everybody had left the scene and i went to grab my laser which has a very long range. i pointed the laser at the bigger object and shone the green light at it. it looked as if the laser had hit it and at that time, the objects seemed to move slightly up and started pulsating. so technically you can say that i've made contact with ufos, but it wasn't direct! unfortunately, i couldn't take any pictures, because my phone didn't seem to be working then for some strange reason. then they continued  moving nw and faded away and disappeared. then they came back again to the same place they were before. this happened 3 times. in addition to that, you could see these 2 tiny red lights in the sky at the same time as the other 2 lights, moving in different directions and in straight lines and changing direction. i

the phone, so i was observing while talking to the person on the phone.  it was difficult to keep focused on my phone conversation, because i wanted to run inside and get my husband (who was sleeping), or get my camera, but i wasn't able to think straight about what to do while on the phone.  \r\n\r\ni was in the office, on the driveway side of our house, when i saw the object hovering a few blocks away.  it was at the same level that a helicopter would fly.  i went outside, still holding the phone to take a better look.  i walked down the driveway to the end, and made a note that the saucer was probably just three or so blocks away, hovering.  i made mention to the person on the phone, but they didn't seem that interested and kept discussing my reason for calling them.  \r\n\r\ni kept my eyes on it from the office window, after i went back inside.  after i hung up the phone, i went outside to look at it, again, but it now had begun surrounding itself with a cloud.  very quickly, it was disappearing from my view, and now i realized that i should've gotten my camera or woke my husband to come look.  \r\n\r\nas the cloud completely surrounded the disc, the cloud began to glow brightly from within the cloud, and then the glow was gone.  the cloud was there for a little while, and then i lost interest and went in the house.  \r\n\r\ni honestly cannot give an exact date of when this happened.  it was likely in early 2010.  i know the year was 2010, and since i was discussing things with the irs, it would've likely been before april, but i have no recollection of even the month, at this point.  sorry for that.  \r\n\r\none of the things that was disturbing about this is that it would've been hovering over and near a very busy road, (dixie highway), between 10:15 am and 10:45 am.  also, this was only blocks from the pompano beach airport, where they house the goodyear blimp.  i wondered if anyone else was seeing this craft?  i guess i'll never know.  it was not on the news. i watched the news hoping someone else saw it.  \r\n\r\ni felt a need to share this.  i have another report to make of a craft i saw in connecticut, circa 1976.  i suppose i should report that on another website?  it feels good to get these stories off my chest!  thank you!","distance":"501 Feet - 1
