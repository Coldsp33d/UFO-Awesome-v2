came to know that i have to visit one of our customer in mp(maddhya pradesh) our customer is hindalco so without any further preparation i board a train from kolkata to singrauli (shaktipunj express) from howrah. i couldn't sleep well in train so at night i was awake almost all the time. the incident took place at around 1:15am when i was looking through the window i saw a plane is flying parallel to our train so i overlooked it but suddenly it catch my attention when i saw strange lights coming from it green, yellow, red, orange, blue all the colors are there it was just amazing to watch, so i watch it for a while the i realize amazing and horrible things. the unusual craft is moving very fast like jumping from one place to another place in seconds first it was small jumps then over time it jumps like one end of the sky to another end and then come back to the same place again then again right above our train then right side of the train again in left side. i came out to the door of the train to watch it clearly i saw it clearly, generally a plane took at least 15-20 seconds or more to cross the area which it crosses in a blink of an eye,and the lights were really unusual. it happens after we cross the station chetar somewhere in jharkhand i think and stopped where few days ago a train accident happened lots of flud lights are there the train also slowed down there. i you want i can give you all the details. kindly reply me. \r\n\r\nthanks and regards\r\nsandip roy \r\n+918013169556","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

was broad daylight, they were pretty far away. they were definitely reflecting sunlight, maybe even more so than a metallic structured craft. think how a mirror can reflect light from very far away.I remember thinking that it's weird to see \"lights\" in the sky in the middle of the day. several miles away from where i was standing, making them difficult to see clearly. four of them were in a diamond formation with one or possibly two off to the right side. they seemed to be moving in and out of this formation continually. one would move right up next to another, then back to it's original spot in the formation. eventually the formation was broken and they appeared to be moving about randomly after that. they never stopped heading west, all the maneuvers were performed while moving away. as they moved away, they became more difficult to see, until eventually i lost track of them all. my neighbor claimed they might be balloons, but they don't stay in formation or maneuver back and forth, or look like mirrors reflecting sunlight.\r\n5. i went from surprised to happy to motivated to annoyed and to vindicated and back again. as i watched this happen, i did try to take a video

his eyesight was so bad that he wouldn't be able to see them.

view our solar system from above (to gain this understanding and \"perspective\").. (an \"overhead\" perspective)..Enter date of 6/30/2015 start (your simulation) at around 10pm (i observed and had this revelation as the conjunction was occurring) run it forward through midnight...I began to wonder if i could find more occurring... i did....As i repositioned the perspective to zoom out and an overhead view of our system i made what appears to be shocking discoveries.. multiple conjunctions\r\nfrom earth:\r\n1.Jupiter-venus\r\n2.Mars-mercury (possibly @ earlier hour)\r\nfrom moon:\r\n1.Jupiter-venus\r\n2.Uranus-earth\r\n3.Mars-mercury (possibly @ earlier hour)\r\nfrom

jupiter:\r\n1.Uranus-mars\r\n2.Earth-venus\r\n\r\nnow if that all wasnt enough. still zoomed out above the solar system i suddenly observed what appears to be the planets making a sort of arrow!!!!!!\r\nif you make jupiter the point of the arrow and draw a line from it to uranus, neptune, earth...You will observe an arrow or pointer..Of sorts....So at that point i was stunned....I thought some more and asked myself could this \"arrow\" really be pointing to something?  i decided to change the perspective lowering it to a \"level\" position observing jupiter from behind and to the rt of earth...As i looked it appeared that there was a star off in the distance in front of jupiter..There was..Iz..But wait...So i said to myself ok.. lemme change to a constillational view.............When i did i was dumbfounded.... \"the star\" i thought i was observing was ... is regulus.....\r\n\r\nso... i ask my best friend what kind of star is regulus and of course he informs me its not... its four stars........Now..... about 2 or 3 hrs later he comes running to tell me.. a new crop circle was just discovered ... near stone hedge.........Smh..Smh..Smh.....So i tell him to show me a pic of it...And well when he did, i immediately knew what it is...Depicting....\r\n\r\n\"the cross\" = tip of a spear = arrow = pointer\r\n\"4 crescents = the 4 stars of regulus (the 2 that

visibility about 7pm on a summer evening. the sun was behind the house and was still relatively high above the horizon. there was little cumulus and the wind was light. it was about 1 hour before high tide, fisherman were at the sea wall on the sea front. about 25-30' above the horizon looking east i witnessed a spinning orb for about 6-9 seconds. it just appeared from thin air, it looked like a spinning coin that flashed at a regular frequency. the spinning orb moved to my right towards berry head brixham about 1/2 mile from the end of the peninsula. the flashing appeared to intensify and the spinning orb disappeared. during the incident i checked myself and looked away towards torquay and returned my sight to the anomaly and it was still there. when the anomaly disappeared i held up my right hand to gauge the size of the craft. it was about half the size of my little finger nail, gauging the distance was difficult but appeared to be within 3-4nm of my location. the craft made no noise and moved laterally without elevation change. after the incident i went down and spoke to some fisherman about what had happened. one group said they saw it another group did not want to talk. i have lived all over the planet and have witnessed anomalies in sierra leone, africa, northern california (likely beale afb air traffic) and hot spots in the south west of england. i am not afraid of witnessing these occurrences. i worked in northern california for many years and have credible stories and professional witnesses that have seen and shared occurrences. i knew a fellow sailor who worked for the fbi in the et investigative branch based in sf. he shared stories that they were aware of 5 species of et. 3 friendly 2 hostile. this is going back 20 years now. they were capable of radar tracking craft as far as saturn. the information still scares me today. we are being observed and we need to make peace and settle our human petty differences and respect our planet, or else something worse will happen..

(trailer). i was alone, my mom had gone out for some errens. i was making coffee at the counter. this counter jutted out into the kitchen leaving the front door easily in my sight to the right and the back door just slightly pass my perifrial vision on the left. no tv, no music, no neighbors. out of the corner of my left eye, i saw movement at the back door. i looked and saw a 6' grasshopper ish being with a tuxedo with tails, a top hat, and a black cane with a carved bonelike top. he knocked on the back screen door. i looked back at my coffee cup in disbelief, then i looked again and it was still there, cocked his head. i looked away again in fear. looked one final time, saw it was still there and that's the last i remember. the whole event took only moments. \r\n\r\ni moved to l.A. in jan. of 1981. i had no memory of this event. i didn't tell my mom anything when she came home that day, i don't remember anything more from that day. \r\n\r\nit wasn't until i was in college that i remembered it. it came back as clear as it was that day not over time but all at once. i began telling the story to my close friends but there was always part of me that questioned weather it happened or not. i am an artist, maybe i made it up. but the detail was too clear and then i rented the vidio \"communion\". i'm sure you know the premis of that movie as well as it's location. when i saw the alien wearing the tux, tophat and cane, i damn near fell off my chair. it was like being hit with a brick. what are the odds of that. there's no way we both dreamed up the same being with those odd details. this is not your standard grey. i think it's important to note that the movie came out after my encounter. this was proof to me that i really saw it that day. i even made a painting of it that's a virtual photograph of the event. i would be glad to provide you with a copy of that painting. my purpose in writing you is to add my story to your records but more importantly i would really like to know if anyone eles has seen this and if they remember anything more about the encounter. i would really like to know what happened that afternoon after my 3rd and final glance. my rebooted memory stops at the third glance. but i got a feeling that was not the end of the story. please let me know if you have heard of anything like this and thank you for all you do to inform and

i'd estimate it to be somewhere near the top of the hill, across the valley i look across to. \r\n\r\ni didn't see where it came from but as i watched it was slowly ascending. the light was unwavering, not pulsating or flashing. it was like a green traffic light. \r\n\r\ni turned to film it rise, but it's hard to make out as i was only using my iphone. you can see it's moving in the video.\r\n\r\ni then took a few pictures, some zoomed in. again, they're not very good.\r\n\r\ni called my girlfriend, who watched it with me for less than a minute. i carried on filming the

swerve to the right and descend rapidly. the lights seemed to stop and fly along with me.  one light was a little above the other.  the 2 large bright lights then moved very slowly from nw of my aircraft to directly west of my side window. then suddenly a third large light appeared to the rear of the other two lights with a little more distance between it and the first two. my friend had been looking down at some flight charts when i calmly ask him to look out  to the left of the aircraft. he is normally not very excitable but he became terrified and started to call ft worth center to report the sighting. i stopped him because i didn't want to be diverted to carswell afb for interrogation which had happened to a friend of mine. i did call center and ask them if there was any other traffic in my vicinity and they replied negative. i was not excited because i had several sightings on clear nights at 45,000 ft. flying from new york to dallas addison airport where we were based.These sightings were much further away and eventually took off at extremely high rate of speed leaving a short streak of light behind them as if there was some friction involved. the 3 large bright lights disappeared suddenly. these sightings all appeared between 1969 and 1982.  the first sightings appeared close to the usa moon landing,also the high altitude ufo's took off at about a 45

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Beginning about age five i developed a need,  which soon became a compulsive need, to visually check all four corners of my bedroom before i could turn off the light and go to sleep. this need was the same even when we moved to a new house. i don't know what i expected to see, or what i was afraid would be there, but i absolutely had to check the corners before i could relax and go to sleep. as a child i was never afraid of the common childhood scary things. i was not afraid of an “under the bed monster” or “the closet monster”, the corners of my bedroom drew my concern.\r\n\r\nin the summer of 1966 i was eleven years old. i lived with my mother, a single working mom, in the city of nevada, mo, a town of about 10,000 people. we had a large older home situated on the corner of a typical four way intersection in a neighborhood of similar homes. it was just my mother and i in the four bedroom home.\r\n  i am unsure of the exact date but at some point during the summer vacation from school, i began waking up each night from a sound sleep to the same mental image. i would not be dreaming about the image prior to waking. during those brief moments between sleep state and being awake, the moments when you know you have been asleep and you know you are waking up but are not fully awake, that collection of brief moments would always be the same. i would have a vividly clear image of hugging a smooth, white, warm, cylindrical object that was emitting a pulsating energy of some sort. the pulsating was on for 1 ½ seconds and off for the same amount of time. i would hear but more so feel a humming during the pulsations. the energy emitting from the object had no noticeable effect on me. there was no electrical shock or tingly feeling. no real feeling at all yet i was certain it was emitting energy of some sort. i do not know why i felt it was emitting energy but it was certain to me that it was doing so. i would be sitting beside this object with my arms stretched out and wrapped against it. it was about four feet tall and probably five feet in diameter. every night i would awaken to this mental image. as soon as i was fully awake the image would go away and i was able to go back to sleep. at first it was puzzling and confusing as to why this was happening. after a few months of this it became frustrating. after eight or nine months of waking to this every night i became quite angry about it. after what was probably a year of waking to this mental image every night i awakened this night, as usual, but instead of rolling over and going back to sleep i sat up on the edge of my bed, feet on the floor, and rested my hands on my knees. i stared at the floor just in front of my feet and tried to figure out why this was happening and what this object was and where had i seen it. i had become quite angry with the situation. in my mind i screamed “what is this and why do i keep seeing it”?  the memory that unfolded to me that night was as clear and vivid as any memory i have. it was not a dream. it was not an eleven year old boy’s imagination. it was shockingly real and unfolded as follows:\r\n\r\ni woke up in my bed, unsure of the time but it was dark. i raised my head just enough to see four creatures coming towards my bed. one came from each corner of my bedroom. they were about four feet tall and even though it was dark there was enough moonlight coming in my windows i could tell they did not look like regular people. the next thing i remember is being carried above their heads across our front lawn, over the curb and into the street. i could not feel their hands but also did not feel as though i was laying on anything. there was a very thick fog all around and a bright white light was reflecting off the fog and the intersection was extremely lit up. i could see just enough of the front of a house to recognize it as the house across the street from ours. i was being carried to the intersection on our corner. i looked to my left and saw my mother being carried in the same manner. her eyes were closed and she appeared to be asleep. i felt sedated but at the same time i knew this was actually happening. i felt no fear and no need to struggle to free myself. in the center of the intersection sat a craft. it was perhaps thirty feet in diameter and was saucer shaped. it was probably ten to twelve feet from top to bottom at the center angling to eight or ten inches at it’s rounded edges. it was standing on three legs that appeared to unfold from the bottom. there was a hatch that folded down to form a ramp. i remembered thinking it was odd that they parked in the middle of the intersection. what if a car came along and hit it? what if a neighbor looked out the window and saw it? i know it’s hard to believe but these were my only thoughts about the situation i had found myself and my mother in. i should have been terrified. i should have been trying to get free and run away or something. i can only attribute it to the sedation. \r\n i do not remember being carried into the craft. i next woke up sitting on the floor in a circular room that appeared to be the same diameter as the craft i had seen in the intersection. the room was about seven feet high. i do not know if there were other levels above or below. it was white and well lit although it was not apparent where the light was coming from. the walls of the room angled to a small height just as the exterior of the craft had. the inside of the room seemed very plain and devoid of knobs and switches and gauges compared to the pictures i had seen of the gemini space capsules our astronauts flew in. across from me was a counter a few feet above the floor and above the counter was what appeared to be cabinets.\r\n i had the feeling i had just stopped crying. i looked up and a creature was kneeling down in front of me. she was about four feet tall with gray weathered looking skin. her hairless head was too large for her body. she had very little muscle mass. she had large black almond shaped eyes and practically no nose and a slit for a mouth maybe two inches wide. she fit, perfectly, the description of a gray alien but it would be close to twenty years before i heard the term or saw an artist’s rendition of one. she asked me “are you alright now”? even though she did not actually say the words, i heard them perfectly. i could hear the sound of her voice in my head and there was no noticeable accent. at age eleven i was not familiar with the term “telepathic”. i answered her with “yes”. she smiled a tiny smile and i found her to be very comforting. i should have been terrified but i was not. i should have been full of questions but i felt no need to be so. again, i can only attribute that to being sedated. \r\n\r\n i heard my mother making a sound she made whenever she was very scared. i looked to my left across the room and i saw her lying on a table with four or five creatures surrounding the table. i could not see what they were doing to her. they all looked like the creature kneeling in front of me. i said “they are hurting my mom”. she said “no, they’re not. she thinks they are but she will be fine”. i said “well, she doesn’t like that”. the creature in front of me smiled that tiny smile again and said “no, she doesn’t like it but she will be fine”. she again asked me was i alright now and i responded yes, i am. with that she stood up and walked four or five steps across the room and sat on a type of chair or stool and began doing something with a small device on the counter in front of her. i have no idea what the device was or what she was doing with it. in 1966 a basic computer filled a large room and i had no concept of today’s pc or laptop. i felt the need to go back to sleep so i leaned against an object to my immediate left. it was a cylindrical object about four feet tall and five feet in diameter. it was white and warm. i stretched my arms out and placed them against it as well as the side of my face. it was pulsating and emitted a hum and i could feel a type of energy emitting from it. i went to sleep. i have no memory of being examined or how i got back into my home.\r\n\r\nafter this memory unfolded before me that night i felt relief that i finally knew what i had been waking up to every night. i accepted the fact that this had actually happened to me and my mother. i cannot understand why i did not find the experience frightening or why i felt no need to ask any questions about who these creatures were and what did they want from us. i can only attribute it to being sedated. in no way do i feel this experience negatively impacted my life. if anything, i feel the opposite. i say that because i do not have to wonder if reports of ufo’s are real or not. i do not have to try and keep an open mind about reports of abductions. i know they are real and i have honestly been aboard at least one craft. \r\n\r\n i do often wonder why i started feeling the need to check the corners of my bedroom many years before the abduction occurred. i cannot see it as a precognitive situation. had i been abducted earlier and simply have no memory of the event? why can i remember the one abduction and not any other(s)? i do not wake up nightly to the humming and feeling of pulsating energy from “the object” anymore, that stopped the night the memory came to me, but i do still need to check the corners of whatever room i am sleeping in. \r\n\r\ni only discussed this event with my mother one time a few years before her death. (i did not discuss it with her as a child because i was afraid if she had no memory of it she would not react well to hearing her son say he had been in a flying saucer.) i asked her if she had any memory of being carried out of our house one night in nevada, mo. she got a panicked look on her face and said she had made peace with it by convincing herself it was just a bad dream and wanted to leave it that way. i respected her wishes and made no further mention of it. \r\n\r\ni am submitting this because i feel the work mufon does is important and the only way we will ever get to the truth is if people make their experiences known. i give mufon permission to use the description of this event in whatever manner they see fit. i give mufon permission to contact me if they wish to do so. i do not want my name or contact info to be made public.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":67484,"landingOccurred":true,"latitude":37.820890671456674,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07012015-0023","longitude":-94.33904052080365,"occurred":-113270400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1435763833000,"summary":"Abducted at age 11 along with my mother in 1966","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":25,"maxtempi":77,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":18,"meantempi":65,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":12,"mintempi":53,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":25,"maxtempi":77,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":18,"meantempi":65,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":12,"mintempi":53,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"64772","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":17928,"locationName":"Nevada, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"Alien Encounter","$$hashKey":"object:22936"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Reno","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on american airlines flight 166 from boston to lax when i observed a group of objects flying effortlessly through the clouds over the desert of what i think was nevada. my phone was still on eastern time at the time and reports the time of the photos i took as 3:05 pm so i am sure the flight data would help locate the place where this occurred. i was on the right side of the plane, facing north out of the window when i noticed at least six bright, shining, almost burning orbs in the clouds. some dipped down behind the clouds. others rose. they illuminated and cast shadows in the clouds as they moved. i was dumbfounded at first and it took me a few minutes to even thing to get my phone out and record the events. by the time i got my phone out, only three remained. and by the time i thought to switch from still photos to videos only one remained. three appeared in a formation. others ascended and descended independently. i shot the photos, recorded video, and then the last one faded.
