and round. seemed to have a light in the middle of it. it was moving straight slow and then went behind a cloud and all of a sudden started going the completely opposite direction. planes can't turn that fast.\r\n-i was in shock and really surprised. i am a firm believer in extraterrestrial and studying biology in school. but i've never seen anything like this.\r\n-it ended up going behind another really small cloud and then i never saw it come out from behind the cloud. so i looked around and i found it like 50 feet in front of the cloud. like it teleported or something. and then i couldn't see it anymore. it was gone.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

vidalia. the highway was 2 lane and very few vehicles were traveling the road. i noticed two jet trails in the west that were very odd. there were jets going different directions and their trails would dissapate. the two i was watching remained the same, always the same width, length, and angle. other jets were flying this way, that way, and within minutes their vapor trails would dissapate the two of these objects stayed exactly the same. i watched this go on and on as i made my way toward alexandria. it is a long straight highway, so i was just curious as to what was going on. it's getting latter in the afternoon, and i'm getting closer to alexandria when i enter trees on the right side of the highway, when i drive out of the trees, there is a field, now i have a perfect view of one of the objects. it's not on the ground, but something like tree top high off the ground. in the middle there is a large brown circular object that has dents, or indentions. in a wide ban around the center of the ufo there are other different size brown objects that are the same color and makeup, but not as large. these objects are just motionless, and there is like a grey or brown mass around the entire ufo. it appeared as if the boulder objects were suspended in a spider web looking material. i was really close and extremely scared, i was glad that the highway turned south at this exact time. i was just outside of alexandria, and in couple of minutes i was in the edge of traffic. i know other people had to have witnessed this but i never heard a word about this from any source. i saw this many other afternoon's. too many to put into words, but not one thing was ever said or printed. the last time i saw this thing was probably dec.2013\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

showed her both planets and with jupiter you could see 3 of it's moons coming off at the 7 o'clock position and one at the 1 o'clock. theses appeared as small pinpoint objects. i had just taken over the eyepiece once again, and as i looked at the conjunction a pinpoint, pulsating or rapidly blinking light flew thru my view behind jupiter. unfortunately the occurrence happened so quickly i didn't have a chance of getting a pic of it. after it passed thru my field of view i quickly looked up with my naked eye to see if i could make it out (the red pinpoint), but it was not to be found in the

over into the back parking lot behind the 4l plaza (261 n. broad st.) to streach my legs. i spent a minute or so walking around behind the car and was headed back towards the front of the car when i looked up to stare at a radio tower located 35-40 ft. in front of. as i was looking at the top of the tower i noticed movement  out of the corner of my eye. i then saw what i thought was a plane at first off to east moving west on a straight path. it quickly realized it  was in the shape of a v, so i thought maybe a stealth bomber. but then i could see it wasn't a plane but was actually 6-10 objects flying in a v formation. i then thought to myself it must be a flock of geese? but as it got closer i could see no flapping wings and there formation was way too precise to be geese. as the got a little closer i could see they where all perfect spheres. they looked to silvery metallic at first like huge steel ball bearings. but then turned transparent right bout the time they got directly above my location. i could bearly see them, just like thier spherical outline and some of the link ghts from the city below would reflect off of them as they passed. i then thought to myself that this must be some top secret new aircraft. maybe like a new type of drone? then just before they disappeared behind the cloud off to the west several of the objects quickly switched places back and forth in the formation. there movement was so quick and so precise when they did so that chills ran down my spine, because i just knew that nothing man made could manuvore like that. i was left frozen in place and shaking my head in disbelief. i could not fathum what i just saw. i don't think i was the only one to see it. because 20 minutes later after i droped off another fair i noticed a group of  6-7 people standing in the save-a-lot parking lot staring and point in the direction of where i saw the objects. one of they was even holding thire phone up in the air like they where using

occurred and what happened.  i do not have any video.\r\n\r\nat approximately 7:15 pm, i was in a car that my wife was driving.  we stopped at a cvs drug store and she went inside to pick up a prescription.  i remained in the car in the parking lot.  i was just killing time looking around and i observed in the sky, in a southeast direction but pretty much overhead of my location, what appeared to be a bright star that that a yellowish tint to it.  i stared at it, wondering if it was a planet.  i had never seen a yellowish star before.  i looked at it for approximately 5-8 seconds.  then it just blinked out.  i thought maybe it had been covered by a cloud or something, so i kept looking at the same spot waiting for it to appear again.\r\n\r\nbut after that initial bright looking \"star\" disappeared.  six more of the exact same size, brightness and color, appeared in the same spot.  but these six \"lights\" were in a configuration that i could not and can not explain.\r\n\r\ni do not know if these \"lights' were six different objects in some kind of formation, or if all six lights were on one very large object.  i could not see any shape of or outline of what object these lights may have been attached too.\r\n\r\nthe six lights also only lasted approximately 5-8 seconds, then they all blinked out.  they had appeared simultaneously and blinked out simultaneously.  the entire time i observed the initial lone light and afterwards, the six lights.  these lights never moved.  they were all stationary the entire time.  which is strange in and of itself.   none of the lights ever pulsated or blinked.\r\n\r\ni can get the exact date if it is needed.  i would just have to check with the pharmacy and see what day we picked up a \"z-pack\" from the pharmacy.  it should be in their records.\r\n\r\ni have made a drawing of what i observed, and it is shown here in this email.\r\n\r\ni should state some facts about me.  i am 62 years old.  i served 8 years in the marine corps, and i am a retired police lieutenant of the cleveland police department.  my vision is good, and i don't claim that this was some kind of alien spaceship.  i am only reporting what i observed, and stating that what i saw is not explainable by me.  in truth i am a pretty sharp fellow.  but i have no even remotely reasonable explanation for what i observed.\r\n\r\nas i said earlier.  i could not see any detail of what these lights may have been attached too, or on.  but my impression at the time, was that they were on one large object, that was probably triangular in shape.  mostly because the alignment of the lights was so perfectly aligned.\r\n\r\nmaybe someone else reported something similar in my area, and if so.  please let me know.\r\n\r\nhere is my drawing of what i saw, but they were much lighter in color than my

would dissapate. the two i was watching remained the same, always the same width, length, and angle. other jets were flying this way, that way, and within minutes their vapor trails would dissapate the two of these objects stayed exactly the same. i watched this go on and on as i made my way toward alexandria. it is a long straight highway, so i was just curious as to what was going on. it's getting latter in the afternoon, and i'm getting closer to alexandria when i enter trees on the right side of the highway, when i drive out of the trees, there is a field, now i have a perfect view of one of the objects. it's not on the ground, but something like tree top high off the ground. in the middle there is a large brown circular object that has dents, or indentions. in a wide ban around the center of the ufo there are other different size brown objects that are the same color and makeup, but not as large. these objects are just motionless, and there is like a grey or brown mass around the entire ufo. it appeared as if the boulder objects were suspended in a spider web looking material. i was really close and extremely scared, i was glad that the highway turned south at this exact time. i was just outside of alexandria, and in couple of minutes i was in the edge of traffic. i know other people had to have witnessed this but i never heard a word about this from any source.

of energy.  i had taken two videos, one at 8:18 p.M. and the other at 10:06 p.M.  the direction was nnw over blue springs lake at an elevation of about 18° from the horizon.\r\n\r\n1.\t in the first one, while observing what appeared to be a blinking light flying nnw over blue springs lake, one can see a series of images of two lights, with an occasional streak.  the following are some of the images of the craft in the 1st video.  it may be possible that the bluish colored lines below the bright images are parts of a larger sphere which is only partly visible on occasion.  they resemble elements of the spheres that have been observed during the last eight months.  (frame 4:49) is a good example.\r\n   \r\n2.\tthe 2nd video  shows blinking lights that change morphologically during energy pulses.  the (frames :23 and :48) are some of the variations in which yellow-redish energy pulses take place.\r\n          \r\nthen as the craft dissapeared from view in the second video, i noticed a red background field. it began with (frame 1:22).  it began very faintly, and then intensified by the end of it.  it is unclear what could be causing the energy field, but it does appear to be round.  \r\n\r\ncomparisons of red fields during 2nd video\r\n\r\nanalysis of the first video began after the second had been completed.  one can see a field intensifying from the 14-second mark.  it became so intense that there is little need to edit the (frame at 22:58)...  1/60th of a second later, frame 22:59, it disappeared and all was black.  then it reappeared again in frame 23:00 and was visible until the final frame in 23:10.\r\n\r\nenhancement to the second video’s full view of the field in (frame 2:21) shows a full red energy sphere.  \r\n\r\nas of now, there is no explanation of what the nature of this energy field is.  whether it is a craft, a portal, or a field that is generated remains unknown and only speculation at present is possible.  what is clear however is that it was present on two occasions and exhibits a tendency to intensify, to completely disappear, and to reappear again during filming. this is the only occasion in which this has been apparent thus far.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

right over some homes across the small valley.I assumed it was a smaller plane because there was a row of approx. 6-7 round white lights along the \"side\" in a row.I knew it was going to crash because it was so low in a hilly area.I drove around a curve in the road and was startled to see the object was now right over the road in front of me.This was a matter of seconds and it had to have been at least a mile away.It was still and about 20ft off the road so i assumed it was a helicopter.I drove under it and stopped,opened my window and looked up.It was not a plane or a helicopter.It made no noise ,there was no downdraft.It was just dark with these lights.Nothing happened i just stared at it.I was worried about being late for work and eventually drove off with it still hovering over the road.Can not believe i left,i was very calm,not afraid at all,it was very surreal.The next day i noted that power lines were going across the road in the approximate area.It was definitely an object and not identifiable.From a distance it seemed to be about the size of a small passenger plane,when i was under it,it went beyond the sides of the 2 lane road so i could not see the length due to rain and dark.It is still a mystery to me to this day but i can still remember it all as though it were last month.No other cars were seen on the road before or after this incident.I did a sketch at the time that i am trying to locate.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Path then

friend was leaving the next day to head to alberta for work.  so rather than a party, another friend and i decided to just treat him to a beer and have a quiet evening, as he had an early morning flight.  we only had a couple of beers each, i think its important to specify this so no conclusions can be made that we were impaired in any way.  the three of us decided to sit on the dock at a local lake and just talk a bit, we were just saying good by to our friend.   \r\nyears before i had seen a movie where some kids were stuck in the desert, and a local kid was helping them survive and cross the desert, (i have no idea of the name of this movie, but i believe it may have been a disney movie).  anyway in one of the scenes, it was night time and the local kid sees an object moving through the sky, he points it out to the other kids and says the gods are moving in the sky.  the other kids  try and explain to him that no, its not the gods, it a satellite.  the movie showed the object and it looked like a star moving across the sky.  \r\nback to my story, that night on the dock by the lake, i happened to notice the same thing, an object moving across the sky which looked like a star.  you could easily tell this thing was extremely high, not an aircraft such as a helicopter, as i said it looked like a star, plus there was no sound.  i said to myself cool, it must be a satellite on a polar orbit, just like i had seen in that movie years ago.  i knew it was a polar orbit as it was heading from south to north.  i watched this thing move north for perhaps a minute.  we were sitting facing west, it was perhaps 15 degrees west of us, not directly overhead.  i picked it up when it was perhaps 30 degrees south west of us and i followed it until it was roughly about 15 degrees north west of us.  it was at this point that it stopped, it did not slow down, it just stopped.  this is when i spoke, at the same time, my friend who was leaving in the morning also spoke, exclaiming at the same time, holy $()/&, did you see that, he had been following it as well.  for the next minute or so we were trying to point out this \"star\" to our other friend who had not seen it.  where it had stopped in the sky was directly next to another \"star\", while still trying to point out this thing to our other friend, it started moving again just as fast as before.  only this time it was not heading north, it was heading north east, it changed direction by about 40-45 degrees from its original course.  as incredible as that was, the star that it had stopped by, well that one started moving as well.  that one headed north west.  it was at this point that, when they started moving again that our other friend picked them up.  we followed them as long as we could but they blurred with the other stars and disappeared.   \r\nthat is my story, perhaps it can be explained, perhaps not, i just figured it was time to share it.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
