i noticed 4 dimly lit lights in the sky, that i at first took to be stars. i realized that they were too big to be stars and they were the wrong colors. they seemed to be grouped together in a cross-like pattern and the colors were white, green, red and orange. after watching them for several minutes, i also realized they were moving together in formation. in the 20 or so minutes i watched them, they moved approximatly 10 degrees north to south. i decided at this time to see if i could find some friends of mine, or maybe a police officer with a radar gun, at a coffe shop i frequented at this time. i had no luck, so returned to the track about 20 minutes later. the lights were still there, at approximatly the same height, but their orientation had changed. the white light was still in the lead but the 2 lights that had upper and lower of the cross were now switched, and after watching for another 20 minutes, the entire cluster was moving from south to north. nothing else of significance happened and i left, feeling sure the whole thing must have been some kind of atmosheric disturbance of some kind. it does seem to me that the next days news cast mentioned that other people in the area had also seen lights in the sky that night, although i cannot now find any evidence of this now.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

to them began flashing but not at a regular pulse (smaller light can be seen in image). when i got home and started looking at the details of the images, the timestamps were not what they sould have been for the images. where the lights were, there was nothing in that area for miles and miles as far as structures, houses, or any signs of life and they were down in an area where they wouldnt have been seen from the ground because there were desert walls all around it. i could make out some type of image just on the edges of the light, and it looked like a metalic grey. the little light was to the right of the middle big light and it began blinking after i started taking pictures, but it wasnt a steady blink, it would blink...Blink blink...Blink blink blink...Blink blink, so it wasnt random. my first thought was ufos as i kinda laughed it off and figured it was government stuff. looking directly at the bright lights hurt my eyes like looking at the sun even at 34,000 feet. i said

though that seemed possible for the set of orbes that fell towards ocean, the second set of orbes is what made me wonder. they did not fall but stayed absolutely stationary before disappearing into thin air. my reaction was to remain calm and alert my father and the instructor. my father couldn't look because he was busy with the flight controls, but the instructor also saw the orbes. we had no

or early 1963. (i was only a kid)\r\nwe (my family) just moved into a new house in vienna, va. (1962)\r\nbeing this was a new house and surroundings to me, i was very unfamiliar to the house and yard. i do know i had yet never been in my own backyard. and had no idea what it looked like or its surroundings.\r\ni shared a bedroom with my two brothers. they slept in a bunk bed while i had my own bed.\r\nthe head of my bed was up against the wall which also had a window looking out into our back yard.\r\neveryone was asleep, and i do not have a clue as to what time it was. all i know is us kids were in bed for the night.\r\nsomething made me wake up. i remember the room was bright. for whatever reason i wanted/had to look out the window. to this day i wonder why i looked out the window.\r\nthere were three what looked to be people in my back yard. the whole area was a very bright white. it was like it was in the middle of the day brightness. these entity's reminded me of a family. there was two tall ones, i'm guessing maybe 4 feet tall, and a smaller one. the smaller one was in the middle, and i am pretty sure the two tall ones were holding hands\r\nwith the smaller one. i know they were looking at me. i don't recall seeing their noses, necks, any hair or even mouths. it is like their heads just blended into the body. they were a grayish white. no clothes, and nothing to reveal if they were male or female. just all grayish whiteness except for their eyes which were very dark and the almond shape as it is described now a days.\r\nas weird as it sounds i felt like something was telling me it was ok and not to be scared. and i wasn't scared, and looking back it was very peaceful. they just continued to stare at me. again recalling how i felt very safe and like they were friends. it was a feeling and knowledge from within i am having a hard time explaining.\r\nin the short amount of time i was actually looking out the window, i saw my back yard for the first time. it was all lit up like daylight. i saw a few bushes and trees. i even saw a shiny structure to the right of them about 15 feet. it went straight up is all i knew at that time. turns out it was a neighbors antenna tower. he was an amateur radio operator i found out years later.\r\nclose to the base of this tower but in front of it it was as white/grayish as can be, and i think i saw a structure, and i do recall it appeared to be a saucer shape. but i am not sure of this as i was more interested in these three entity's and it was very bright and hard to look at the saucer \"thing\". i recall it was hard not to continue looking at the three of them.\r\ni know i am repeating myself but i felt very at ease and safe, and because of this(?) i dropped back down into my bed and fell right back to sleep.\r\nthis is something else in all these years i have wondered why i just went back to sleep instead of continuing to watch what was in my back yard.\r\n\r\nweeks/days(?) later, settled in to a new house, i eventually ventured out for the first time into my new back yard. it was like i already knew what to expect in seeing. the same trees, bushes, layout, and yes the antenna tower was all there just as i saw it when i was looking out my window at the three i call friends.\r\nthe most amazing thing about it is there is an indentation in the ground and round in shape where i saw this saucer grayish thing.\r\n\r\nnot many people i have told this to. i have talked to my family a few times about it, and a few close friends. one of my brothers says he remembers that night, but i have a hard time believing it because i don't recall him being awake, but then again, i don't recall looking in my room while all this was happening. so i wouldn't know if anyone else was awake or not.\r\n\r\ni find this incident really weird and strange as years go by. i know what i saw. and being the age that i was at that time, i don't recall watching cartoons or tv shows that showed these \"little gray men\" with almond shaped eyes, no mouth, no neck, etc. i know i didn't read books about it...So i am left knowing what i saw, and now seeing tv shows etc. about this stuff, and everyone in them describing exactly what i saw. it's amazing and baffling at the same time. sometimes i wonder if i was dreaming it. but on the other hand, how can i dream of something i know nothing about? \r\ni remember being at peace and feeling like they were friends (only way i can describe it). it was a strong feeling.

one another to create the super star. she turned in the other direction to take some pics of the moon and the colorful sky and left the camera on continuous mode. while reviewing the pics we noticed that one of them had 3 bright lights all in a row. these lights were not seen in the sky by either of us nor by any of our three kids who were out at the time. i told my wife it was likely a glare or

effects would be if i shot my phone camera at the sun to take some video.  i had previously thought i had seen something while doing this a few days earlier.  \r\n\r\ni shot a video that lasted 19 seconds and was aimed directly at the sun which was at 287° or wnw at an altitude of 16°.   i noticed an interesting sphere within what appears to be a field.   at first i thought all i was seeing was some type of reflection, but the odd thing was that i noticed in many of the frames that lights were on the surface of the sphere.  as can be seen in frames 1:54, 4:11, and 11:44 those lights are in different positions in each frame, as if it were rotating.\r\n\r\nif this had been a reflection, the image should have been a duplicate of the sun, only dimmer and smaller.  instead, the character is such that sphere images are different.  at times, when the sun was moving up in the frame, the sphere moved down and behind a tree.  clearly it had its own movement that was independent.\r\n\r\ni noticed other faint movements in the video frames, but they are very faint.  they also last for just one frame.  most were too difficult to get any decent resolution.  however, frame 15:54 had an image that was able to be edited and enlarged to make it viewable.\r\n\r\nthere was also another frame at 6:30 in which a spot of white appeared in the far right and middle of the image which also was enlarged to be more readily seen.  the light which appeared due to the camera’s shuttering down with the sun’s brightness allowed more detail to be seen and more clarity in what the nature of the object is in frame 6:30.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                    \r\ncurious about the direction and what lay in the direction of the sun, i checked and discovered that the craft was directly over the most westerward of the lakewood lakes, precisely over the middle of the lake.   (see report about jupiter-venus fly-by).   two weeks earlier on june 8th, other craft were observed which seem to come from the same general location as well.\r\n\r\nthe distance this time is 1.25 miles to the center of the lake from my vantage point in the parking lot.  for background information, the image of the location of the june 8th sighting is included as well.\r\n\r\nsummary:\r\n1.\ta sphere entered my videotaping of the sun.\r\n2.\tthe nature of the sphere is that it seemed to be spinning.\r\n3.\tthe sphere had independent movement.\r\n4.\tother craft were seen as well, though much smaller.\r\n5.\tthe location being identical in the lake is not coincidental since both the sun and venus are on the ecliptic plane as well as all planets but pluto.  what is new is the fact that more craft were seen over lakewood lake.  this makes the 2nd time that lakewood lakes seem to have craft associated with it.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

many other mornings before being taken off to school, in the city, my brother and i where tasked to walk a distance from the residence in the (finca) farm, where we where growing up along with my mother and her second husband, the walk normally took us no more than minutes to get from the house to the car gate, there was a concrete pillar on one side that was used for looping a heavy chain with a heavy master built padlock, we kept 3 doberman pincher dogs, for protection and companionship, none that came to greet us or escort us as they usually did (trained), this one time, i remember the air being heavy to breathe as my brother and i approached the gate, we did so without even noticing the orb, as if it was not there, the first we noticed the thing, it was already there, as if it had been there all along, at least it is the feeling i'v had every time i recall that morning, my brother reacted like a flurry, first it was surprise, an expression of startle, then his movements became fractioned to my field of vision, as if he was moving so fast that my eyes could barely register at frames per seccond, like a hummingbird, i was turning to see what he was doing, when i turned, feeling what i can only describe now as an adult as some kind of fractioned time spurts like a badly working high speed shutter, i turned and i saw a creature of pure beauty and symmetrical endowed perfection, the image that later in my teens would become my ideal image of a woman. the only human i have ever seen with nearly identical features is the actress liv tyler, tho her hair was longer and wavy, thin, yet obedient, wore a seamless suit, not skin tight, but form fitting, her voice came to me clearer than sound, as if to my mind instead, it was soft, and delight is the only way to describe my memory of her, maybe what he saw was different, because his was an expression of pure shock and awe, followed by his usual olympian speed (marathon runners, martial arts since age 5) tho while i was mesmerized, he only traveled about 4 to 5 feet, and seemed to move yet i could not see him getting away from me at all, the gate we where standing at measured around 7 feet tall by almost 15 or more wide, cyclone fence welded to l frame metal held up my a pole on welded indistrial hinges, and the opposite side assisted by a thick guide wire , to pull and protect the build from sagging, on the business end was a square pillar 2 foot by 2 foot by about 7.5 or 8 feet, not ornate, the thing was heavy, gravity pulled it open and allowed to be closed by effort to swing it close again without incredible, but considerate effort on our part, (task to teach us teamwork) at the point my mind absorbed the fact that a stranger was looking and talking to us, i remembered my mother's words about talking to strangers, as i remembered those words the woman in the metallic clothing, her voice whispered into my mind to not be afraid, but my fear was already in gear, not because of her, but of what the punishment might be for allowing a stranger to approach the property and so freely speak to us (overly strict childhood) we feared my stepfather more than any childhood imagined monster or movie could conceive, as my heart lept in panic, i felt my body release the hold that frozen me in place with warm delight,  the padlock that i held the key for, not only opened by itself and buckled making the chain fall limp, but the u shaped lock section, came completely undone from the lock block, and again i felt the words don't go/fear,  my recollection fails me after this point, it becomes spotty and fractioned, i remember running behind my younger brother, feeling like our lives might depend on how fast we could muster speed to return to our parents, fear feeding my speed, making every muscle explode in pain and effort, while my brother's image flashed on and off in front of me like a blur, hot, cold, then hot again, when we returned to the residence i realized i was much farther behind than my younger brother, my mother and stepfather, had been waiting for us, they asked us what took us so long, which it took years for me to understand what that question might mean (lost time?), after that even, my mother tried several ways to make us explain what we saw, my brother shut in, still today his recollection of childhood events is spotty, where as for me my memory of those times is acute, im cursed with flashback like events, several times after that, my mother and i would be late sitting on the swing, talking about reader's digest articles and we see strange lights, one time a small light traveling faster than anything ever! leaving no lines, and with no flash, made a 90 degree turn without loosing any speed before disappearing apparently outbound(up), at first i thought it was a shooting star, as we watched it and i made a wish, it veered direction, my mother gasped and we very fast like went indoors, i understood the concept of ufo, at age 12, not because of the movies. there was all manner of silent floaters in the night sky in the republic of panama, west of the now closed howard air base in panama. my brother refuses to speak of the things he has seen even today.\r\n\r\nof course, i tried tell our parents, my mother tried, my stepfather ridiculed us and put us through corporal punishment for making up stories, my grandmother advised to try to forget, or i would go insane, im 39 years old now, talking about something that happened between 10 and 12,  im haunted, every time i watch ancient alines and hangar one,  because i feel i have a story to add, but have kept it closed, for fear of ridicule and financial ruin, im still as afraid as ever, each key stroke here is done with my heart hanging on my throat.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional
