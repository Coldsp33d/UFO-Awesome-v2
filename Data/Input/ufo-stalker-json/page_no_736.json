(it almost looked like the headlights of a plane but bigger and brighter and in an upside down bubble siren shape).  i called to my wife to come and look at it.  it continued north, not blinking, not making any sound and the small cloud followed the light the entire time although there were no other low level clouds in my area.  as me and my wife observed the object it went north over the trees but before it did the light grew dim and appeared to 'blend' back into the cloud with just the edges slightly glowing again.  a few minutes afterwards i noticed three planes fairly close to each other going from the east toward the direction of where the object would be.  although we live over a flight path there are two directions that are usually flown and none of the plane every look or sound like this.  i checked the hubble and iss locations and they were below the horizon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

just left work, went home fed my cats and headed into the hospital to see my husband. drove in front road along the shore line of lake ontario. i noticed something shiny and bright to my right. it looked like a bubble, sort of see through but not, same colours as a bubble but metallic. it landed on the water but did not make a wake, the water was still, the orb took off very quickly along the pier, but there was nothing in the water to show that some thing was going through the water. \r\nthe pier is very well lit and you can see that it was still light out, what  happening. a year earlier i had been followed in town along a street, i was getting off of a night shift, i was driving my bus back to the yard. it was around 3:45 am, it was a still warm summer night. i had my window open and i heard nothing, but i noticed that there was a light following me down the street. i could see nothing over me, and i could hear nothing. i stopped the bus and got out, there was nothing any where around me but the light was still there. i got back into the bus and headed as fast as i could back to the yard. when i turned off of division street it continued down the street, silent and not seeing anything/\r\nthen if we go back all of my life i have feared that some one was watching me and following me. i can remember when i was 10 years old i was in my bedroom with my next door neighbour, she was staying the night at my house. when all of a sudden my hair stood on end, my stomach felt terrible, i was terrified but didn't know why, then my room filled with thousands of little lights. no one i knew had a mirrored ball, i don't think they had them back then. we did not know where the light was coming from as we did not have a light on. i don't remember what happened that night, but i know we were not sleepy, and didn't want to go to bed, but after the lights, the next thing i remember is that we were out in the back yard. the doors were locked, and my window was closed with a screen over the window. the window were on an old war time house, where the windows were change each fall and each spring, they were not a window that even together we could not have lifted them off and gone out and put them back on. we went next door as we were wet and very cold and were afraid to tell my parents. i just get glimpse of that once in a while, i find it scary to remember the visits. my be i'm crazy, and it is just a dream? how do i know what i know?","distance":"20 Feet or

security officer at a mall. we were both in our vehicles talking. it was a clear night, stars in sky very visible. i looked up to see the stars and i noticed right over head a large v shaped craft flying overhead. it was dark and had 5 round light on it. it was flying very slow, flying south west and i noticed no sound came from it. i yelled at the over officer to look up, but he looked at me like i was crazy, by the time he looked up it was just past his vehicle. i told him to get out and look at it before it hit the city lights and you couldnt see it anymore. he never saw it and reported to my boss that he thought i was on drugs. later i started drawing it on paper and showing friends what i saw, most thought i was making it up. later on i started a security job at a holiday inn and part of my job was to deliver first usa today newspapers to the priority club members. i noticed on the front page, was a digital image of exactly what i saw fly over mount vernon, il, it was the phoenix lights story. i showed the newspaper to those friends that didnt believe me. it was so visible, due to the clear sky, i could make out the shape, because it blocked out the other stars. i thought to myself, i was in the military and seen many air craft, i never saw anything like this that had no tail on the end. it was very wide. i stood up and put my hands up in the air to measure it, from where i was at my hands were about 3 feet apart. to this day, i dont know what it was, i cant say it is an alien craft, but something ive never seen before. if it is a govt craft, its something no one knows about. it didnt make any erratic moves, it flew in a straight line, slow, and moving south west, towards phoenix path. to this day, its bothered me, because i dont know what it was, but it was comforting to know many people saw what i saw in phoenix. all i can say is, i just want to know what it was, and was it alien, or a new human technology. the only evidence i have is its exactly what they saw in phoenix, the newspaper image on the front page is what i saw. i would be more than willing to take a lie detector

been converted to an art studio where some kind of an outdoor concert or something was going on.  the few days before and after my sighting, lawrence was hosting a few different festivals with live outdoor music shows with stage lights and big screens.\r\n\r\ni happened to look north of where i was and saw a row of lights that seemed to be blinking or pulsating in the sky to the north.  it looked like three lights at first and i initially dismissed it as an airplane.  the problem is that aircraft running lights do not pulse, and there are not three blue-white lights on an airplane.  there's a green light on the starboard wing, a red one on the portside wing, and a white light on the tail.  this object had a row of lights that seemed to pulse around it, running from left to right.  in fact, it may not have even been individual lights, but just a solid light that pulsed around the object (or maybe just a light, i saw no \"object\" per se, just the lights).  \r\n\r\nwhen i realized it probably wasn't an airplane, i decided to see if it was just the reflection of stage lights on a power line from the outdoor show going on next door.  i walked up a small hill to test this, but the lights stayed where they were and were in fact obscured behind the power line.\r\n\r\nthe object was pretty far away it seemed and also seemed to be moving along the edge of a thunderstorm to the east.  it flew steadily and eventually vanished from my sight behind the tree line.  \r\n\r\ni'm not really sure what i saw, but i'm bringing it to mufon's attention because i have heard that there has been a string of sightings recently around this area of north-eastern and north-western missouri and the greater kansas city area.  i read one post on facebook about the radios going out at harrah's casino and two ufos being spotted over the casino at that time.  apparently there was also a set of clothes found outside, complete with pants, shirt, and shoes, and nobody around, which i thought was bizarre and pretty creepy.  others have been seeing lights and objects in the sky around their homes in the kc area too, so i think that maybe this is significant and worthy of some greater attention.  \r\n\r\nthanks.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

shape was a little different. this for the most part was as described above, a very large 55 gallon drum rotating very slow with no sound and holding its position. had just finished a model rocket

me in. he stayed to observe, but never spoke about it with him after. the school is now indian hill elementary school outside of westerville and is located roughly 45 miles from wright patterson air
