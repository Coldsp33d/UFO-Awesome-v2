flashing in a straight line as an airplane would but they were flashing in random positions and moving erratically. we both noticed them at the same time and she said \"what is that?\" being an unbeliever at the time, i jokingly replied \"close encounters of the third kind\". then suddenly the lights came straight toward us and were no longer lights but rather aircraft of some sort. we only saw one at the time and it was hovering just above the treetops, maybe forty feet off the ground. i turned the car down the street where the ufo appeared to be and stopped the car to get a closer look. i got out of the car and was standing in the street looking up at this thing. i was so close that i could see what appeared to be a row of windows down the side and bright white light was emanating from within the craft. there was a weird colored amber light on the front, a blue light in the middle and a white light on the stern. i could see depth or space in the craft though the windows. and the astonishing thing was there wasn't a hint of any noise. no turbulence on the treetops, no hum, no buzz...Totally silent. as i was standing there observing this thing, my wife shouts \"randy, there's another one!\" from inside the car. she was looking out the back window and saw a second craft coming up at a right angle to the first, like a wing man. again, not a sound. it cruised up and stopped behind the first one. while i'm standing there, the first one slowly glided across the street right in front of my car and started to descent below the treeline on the other side of the street. below the treeline was an school baseball field. my wife said \"it's landing in the baseball field\" so i hopped back in the car and took off around the corner to the field. it didn't take more than a few seconds to get there and when we did, we could see this thing hovering not ten feet off the ground. it sat there long enough for us to get a good look at it, then suddenly it shot up into the sky at such a high velocity that i knew it could not be man made. it was as if it was sucked back up into the sky. so i took off back to where we had left the second one and it was gone too. right after they left, we could see those weird lights in the sky again but then they disappeared. i haven't told anyone this experience for fear of being ridiculed. my wife has since become very religious and she thinks that what we saw were demons because she knows full well that they weren't of this planet. i myself know that we saw extraterrestrial craft.","distance":"21-100

i have started to realize that an incident that occurred when i was only about 15 years of age might have been an alien form rather than a ghost as i was told it might have been.  watching hangar 1 as i have, now and then, it started to make more sense that it well could have been an et.\r\n\r\ni was asleep in my bedroom and it was approximately 3 or 4am in the morning.  the room was dark with only a little light coming from my bedroom window that was at the foot of my bed near my dresser.  you could still see furniture outlines in the room so i could see shapes.\r\n\r\ni was awoken by the sound of someone trying to open the front door which was near my bedroom door but then i realized that all my family was home already and asleep.  it was then fright came up as i realized this was an intruder.  it was raining outside so i could hear the rain too.  i listened to see if perhaps i was just hearing things but then the doorknob actually opened the door which was terrifying to me as it's always locked.  the person came in and i heard the door gently close and then i heard footsteps walking towards my bedroom door.  i knew the sounds of the floor as they were wood and had squeaks here and there and this was authentic, i knew the squeaks.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden i heard the steps stop and i realized the person had stopped at the door to my bedroom and was just standing there looking in for a few seconds.   it was then that i realized that i couldn't move.  i was frozen.  i was lying on my right side facing the wall which was right up against my side of the bed.  my grandmother was sleeping with me because she was visiting from another city and my bed was the only large one - enough to accomodate another person.  she was lying on the outside of the bed right next to the door.\r\n\r\nthe person then entered the room and although i couldn't move i could move my eyes and when the person passed towards the foot of the bed i could see a tall humanlike form which i thought was a male but now that i think of it i don't think it was altogether human, i will explain in a bit.\r\n\r\nthe person stopped before proceeding into the room completely and was standing looking in my direction right at the head of the bed.  i don't know how i didn't pass out then in fright.  my grandmother did not wake up or move.  then the person walked ahead to where my dresser was, near the window at the foot of the bed, and seemed to open something that sounded like a face cream jar that was half full - a very hollow sound.  i don't know if it took something from my dresser or put something in it.  no idea.\r\n\r\nthen the person was apparently done doing whatever it did and started to walk back towards the door of my room.  to my horror it stopped again near where our heads were, i was still frozen, and the next thing i knew i could feel the thing's arm coming over and it touched me on the left side of my neck which was exposed as i was lying on my right side.  i could feel that it was touching my neck with 3 fingers only and at the time, and i still think so, it was a thumb and 2 fingers but it could have been just 3 finters.  i didn't feel warmth and now i am thinking it was more of a reptile kind of touch but not sure.  i do know that the thing was very tall and the more i think about it, must have been tall because i was in a queensized bed, was far to the extreme right side of the bed plus my grandmother was between me and the thing.  it had to reach over her and all across the width of that bed to be able to touch my neck like that.  i passed out in fear.\r\n\r\nwhen i woke up from that i screamed, knowing it was not a dream and awoke my family to tell them.  they said that it was raining and that if someone had come in there would be water in the front porch and in the hall but i instinctively knew that there would not be a trace.  and there wasnt.\r\n\r\nto this day and i am into my 60ties now i still on occasion sleep with the overs over my neck as the feeling of that touch still haunts me.  \r\n\r\ni have to say that while living in that same house i did have a couple of other incidents that were strange and now i wonder if it was all connected or not.  the one that stands out is that, and i don't know if this happened around the same time as this entity appeared or was much earlier or later but one night i was awoken about the same time of the night 3 or 4 am to that same bedroom where i saw the entity by my room totally lit up.  it was like a snow blower city machine was shining it's flood lights into my bedroom window.  it was mid july i think so snow was out.  i got up and went to my window and t he yard was totally lit up too with light but there was no sign of where it was coming from.  however i can't remember looking up.  i might have looked up but i have no memory of that at all.  i can see the yard and grass and big tree that was in front of my window and it was all lit up in white white light but that was it.  something tells me i did look up but there is zero memory of it.  i only mention this because of the entity that was in my room on another night.  i am sure it wasn't the same night though as when i saw the entity because my grandmother was not in the room with me for sure.\r\n\r\ni have always been open minded to ufos and most other things like that but i was not immersed in the topic at all - this all just happened out of the blue.  however after watching hangar 1 it seems to be opening ideas that i had not though about before like the entity perhaps having touched me for a purpose.  i sure hope it's not some way of following me throughout my life.  i have had poor health since about 1990 but up til then i was healthy.  there were no marks on my neck from being touched.  the only medical thing that is a little strange perhaps is that i was diagnosed with cancer years later, many  years later, and the issues were all along my left side.  it might of course just be a coincidence.\r\n\r\nif there is any other information you require don't hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

star but it was too big to be a star and it was 3 of them next to each other they were different sizes i started to get chills and jittery checking behind me as i kept walking home and started getting light headed but it went away. but i seen what i seen i'm not crazy i just sound like it but doesn't every person who claims they've seen a ufo let alone

your vision. the streak disappeared. i thought that i had just witnessed a fireball. i said \"wow\" my buddy says \"what?\" he had not seen or noticed the flash of light. as i was telling him, the object reappeared on the same path as the streak of light. at first it was dim, but it increased in brightness, then quickly faded away. \"look\" i said to my friend and pointed he looked, and sure enough, a second or two later, it came back. he saw it this time. the color had changed, the object was now a red/orange color, and not nearly as bright. this happened a total of five times, including the initial flash, each time it came back, it was harder to see it, then it finally was gone. this lasted 10-15 seconds. i first noticed it to my north, it was traveling, west to

above our house. i could not really capture them, but as i was trying, my eyes caught sight of a very bright object in the nnw sky about 50 degrees up, and as bright as the planet venus at dusk (which we happened to also see), and about as 'large' from where i stood, too. \r\nit was moving faster than an airplane, so i thought it was a meteorite, but its brilliance was sun reflection, not fire. at one point it went 'dark' and i could no longer see, but not long afterwards it was visible again, and much farther along on its trajectory but much fainter too. as i was filming (sadly not in that direction) i said to my grandson \"what was that ...?\" that is why i can be sure of the time when i saw it.\r\n\r\nas it traveled faster than a plane, i thought it might have been the space station, but checking up on its course, i noticed it was not in my area during that day and time.\r\n\r\nthe object did not veer off its trajectory. i lost sight of it because it became too small/faint as it gained distance.\r\n\r\ni felt excited, and also annoyed and frustrated because i could not identify it. i mused to my grandson that it could be an alien spaceship, but that worried him some. when i told him i wanted to get binoculars to see the object better, he was uncomfortable to let me go inside, so i didn't, and stayed with him and watched the object until it was no longer visible.\r\n\r\nhe later asked me if space aliens are real and i answered that i don't know, but that i have never seen one.","distance":"Over One

the night sky, i had a strange experience.\r\n\r\ni was taking the metro home from work.  it was a very crowed metro, peak hours, all chairs were taken and several standing. the metro came to a stop, the doors opened several more people came in, but there was one that caught my attention creating a suffocation feeling and i became extremely uncomfortable.  trying to reason with myself that the feeling was ridiculous and uncalled for i tried to focus on not looking in his direction.  from what i glanced at quickly from time to time this person had absolutely nothing unusual about them.  average height, brown hair 30 something, casual office dressed, standing at the far corner of the metro. i continued to focus on showing nothing and looking out the window, when the metro stopped and the person next to me left. there were several people standing next to the chair but no one sat down when i noticed he was walking towards the empty seat next to me, and sat down.  i focused even more on showing nothing and continued looking out the window.  we did several stops when he got up and left.  but just before he stood up he rested his hand on my knee and then squeezed his thumb and finger so hard on my leg that the pain ran through me so hard it took my breathe away he did this as he slowly stood up. i had no marks or bruises however and i bruise very easily.  the memory and feeling is as sharp today as the day it happened and i have a very poor memory but not only poor i do not affiliate emotion with my memories very well.  this experience is very different and when i think of it i become irritated uncomfortable and a deep desire to understand.  now i don't think that the two experiences have anything to do with each other.  but both were within the same week and both extremely unusual. i was alone for this experience but the story above i was with a friend.
