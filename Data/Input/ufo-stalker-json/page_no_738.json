at coindre hall in huntington ny. when all of a sudden we notices a very large craft flying overhead silently and slowly with a cloud or something under it hiding it from view. however, i do seam to remember seeing a black object above the cloud. the object stopped when it got over huntington harbor at the opening to huntington bay. we then ran down the hill after it and stopped at the end of the dock near the boat house. i remember someone started yelling take me take me. the dock is about 100 ft or so long and we were at the end. we all stood there not talking or moving at all. we were all just staring at the object. the object now had white light columns that seamed to shine down around the perimeter of the object. in the center was a black hole that had a white beam of light that would shine down on the land scan around and go back up. all around the black hole center  radiating out to the column lights was a gas or electricity that was in the clouds or mist that was under the craft. the radiating gas or electricity was colorful and not like anything i have ever seen. there was also a humming noise in the background. every time the beam of light would come down it would scan around and then retract back up into the black hole in the bottom center of the craft. the beam of light did not act like light as we know it. it would come down as if it had an end to it not like light that would keep shining until it hit a solid object. it would descend down scan around and then retract back up getting closer and closer to us every time it came down. i remember thinking that the beam was getting close and feeling a fear come over me. i thought its getting really close now. then all of a sudden it felt as if i had just awoken from a dream, the beam was gone, i columns were gone the sound was getting lower. everything was getting farther up into the sky when the object just took off at a tremendous speed straight up into space. i felt a gust of worm wind in my face followed by wind from behind and it was gone. we all looked around at each  other and said things like omg did you just see that, what was that, in tired, what time is it etc, etc. i remember the whole event felt as if it was only about 15 minutes or so. however, it was 3:00am. although the event only felt like 15 minutes it had actually been 4 hours. \r\n\r\n a few days after the event happened i remember having a dream that i was in a craft looking out a window at an assortment of different looking crafts. i remember that they all looked very different from each other and not like any craft i have ever seen. \r\n\r\n  i have always wanted to get hypnosis to try to see what actually happened during those hours that felt like minutes. however, i don't know if i really do want to know what happened. maybe its something that i will not want to remember. however, i have been getting more curious lately.","distance":"101-500 Feet,

but thought perhaps this could be helpful if there has been.\r\n\r\n1. first in bedroom of home.  then kitchen for husband.  bedroom and then bathroom for wife.  daughter age 12 observed from upstairs bedroom.\r\n\r\n2. horrendous sound of coyotes like we have never heard in 19 years of living in the woods on the north side of holland, michigan which woke all three of us up from sleeping.  we had the windows open as we usually do.  in all these years i have only seen a coyote twice during the day but often hear them at night in the distance.\r\n\r\n3. had no idea what it was. \r\n\r\n4 & 6. after we had been awakened buy the coyotes, i sat on the bed and looked out of the bedroom window while sitting on the bed which faces north.  to my right (east) i observed blinking lights far off in the distance through the woods.  (there was never any sounds after we had heard the coyote's originally.)  it was a very dark night.  i had thought of turning the flood lights on in the backyard but my wife said not to do it.\r\n\r\nthe lights then got closer and several dashed extremely fast through the woods.  the woods to the east and north in our area are parallel tall pine trees planted during the depression times.  west is much more dense and hard to get through.  they continued off to the west.  a final light turned out of the woods from the east over a corner of the basketball court and down the drive westward much closer to the bedroom window.\r\n\r\ni ran to the kitchen on the other side of the house to see if i could see anything more.  westward i saw nothing.  to the southwest i saw a flashing light in the distance far enough out that i presumed in was on 160th.  then in an instant it was in our flower garden in front of the kitchen window.  to move to the kitchen window it would have to pass through thicker random woods which would be hard for anything on foot to do.  i felt like it knew i was looking that way and came towards me.  then it moved to my right and out of view after standing still for 15 seconds in front of the kitchen window.\r\n\r\nmeanwhile, my wife was looking out of the bathroom window eastward into our backyard.  a light moved toward the tree and then down our driveway westward.  she also thought i had run outside because she thought she saw a bare torso of a man in the backyard which she thought was me who had gone out to see.  later she did not see this and it certainly was not me.\r\n\r\n5. evidentially my teeth had been chattering because my wife told me they were.  my wife did not what to turn the lights on outside because she did not know what was going on.  for two months she would not take the dog out at night.  it can be very dark here at night and we still do not like to walk around in the darkness at night.\r\n\r\nmy daughter we did not discuss this with and we did not know she witnessed this until just recently.  she is now age 16.  she saw the lights and thought she saw something in the back yard.  her bedroom is directly above ours with windows facing east and north.\r\n\r\nhere is where a possible explanation comes in.  a bit later it was not as dark and there was a hound dog that was walking outside our bedroom window with a red light flashing light. (not a white flashing light as we had seen before) even weirder is he started clawing at the side of our house off to the side of the bedroom window and howling.   \r\n\r\nso, maybe it was just a pack of dogs all wearing flashing lights running through the woods in the middle of nowhere making no noise.  conceivable, but i have never seen a pack of dogs out here in 19 years.  one occasionally during the day.  nor have i seen any dog around here with a flashing light other than the hound dog.  to me these lights seemed very bright and made no sound even though the windows had been open.  the speed they made it through the woods i have also never seen any animal do out here.  and why no noise?  i can even hear squirrels running through the woods and deer certainly make a noise.

join the raf, the week previously i had been to my third interview/induction meeting. as part of this process i had received a booklet containing all uk raf hardware including the planes and helicopters used as well as weaponry used, with the instructions to learn all the hardware available as we would be tested on this information. after my third interview i was taken aside and informed that due to previous bouts of hay fever i would be unable to continue the process at that time, however i could reapply one year down the line. i still have the letter i received somewhere which would allow me to give an exact date of the sighting. i include this information for two reasons, firstly because at this time i was required to know and identify all types of military aircraft and secondly because i was disappointed by the decision and was outside in the back garden having a cigarette whilst mulling over my options.\r\nit was around 1:30 am and i was sitting on the bench in the back garden contemplating my next move. i remember hearing a faint buzzing sound which i can best describe as the sound an air conditioning system would make. this noise didn't break my train of thought as i remember hearing it and without really thinking about it, attributing it to the nearby motorway. after maybe 20-30 secs of it continuing, my thoughts changed to realising that was not the sound of the motorway, i had never heard anything like it before or since. at this point i looked up and slightly to my right but essentially directly above me i saw three bright white lights in the shape of an equilateral triangle, upon closer inspection i could make out the body of the vehicle which joined the lights. the body was a matt black colour which could be made out against the slightly lighter night sky. as the object moved it blocked out the stars that were in my line of vision. at this point i also saw two orange orbs following the triangular object, these were offset but following directly behind the triangular object, as the three objects flew directly above me the two orbs crossed over, switched position and carried on on the same trajectory. i watched as the objects passed directly overhead until they went out of vision over my house, at this point i ran inside and watched from the living room window as they continued on the same flight path until they were out of sight. the whole incident was over in around 3-4 minutes.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

here.\r\n\r\nlast night we had another ufo sighting. same part of the sky - south of long beach, ca over the pacific.\r\n\r\nat about 10:05 pm, i went outside to sky-gaze as i often do. it was fairly overcast. the moon, which sat high in the wsw sky, was shrouded by the low clouds and cast a diffuse glow. a couple of minutes later, due south and about 30 degrees above the horizon, another diffuse light appeared behind the clouds. it was white and looked similar to how the moon looked, but not as diffuse. it gradually grew brighter, and as it did, two other similar looking diffuse white circles of light appeared, forming an equilateral triangle. they were all about a third to half the diameter of a full moon. \r\n\r\nat this point i yelled for my wife, called her on my cell, and knocked on the pane glass living room window to get her attention. she came running out with her i-phone and saw the triangular formation just before it faded out. as those three lights faded out, a brighter light appeared in between where the other three lights were, and grew brighter, casting a bright glow against the surrounding clouds. we could make out a fairly well-defined bright star-like light at the center and the surrounding glow it cast was about three-quarters the diameter of a full moon. she managed to catch that final light on video before it faded about 30 seconds later. \r\n\r\nall of

back deck which faces west. i was out there summoning as i do every other day or so. once again i saw nothing. i went into the house and noticed a missed call from my brother.. i called we spoke briefly .. only 2 minutes or so. we hung up and i went over to the couch in our living room on the first floor of the home and i sat down. as i'm waiting for everything to load up so that i could play playstation boxing, something told me to look out towards the window in the foyer area of the house, it's one of the smallest viewing windows on the property and is half covered by a diamond shaped curtain. when i looked up, i noticed a very brilliant violet colored light moving smoothly through the sky from the south, moving in our direction which would be a direct north heading. i called my wife erin from upstairs so that she could see what i was seeing. it didn't take long, as the window is located at the bottom of the stairs. her reaction was similar to mine.. basically saying \"wtf?\" again and again. at this time, the object makes a smooth transition to a western heading while maintaining what appears to be the same slow steady speed. i start saying to my wife \"i've gotta go out back and see this thing.. wtf is it? i thought she would be hot on my heels but as i got to the back door i looked back for her and she wasn't there. she had stopped off for the video recorder. when i first noticed it, i thought maybe a ufo? and started yelling for my wife to come quick before it's gone.  the actions observed by myself were, very brilliant violet lights most beautiful clean looking light i've ever seen there was no sound whatsoever. it moved with ease, no effort.. it's light seemed to go on and off randomly.I observed this object vanish only to reappear in the blink of an eye, but in a different location.. i saw it just above the trees and it looked like  a globe with a light in it. some other things it did include.. flying forward then backward.. it changed speeds and went dark but was still viewable. one thing in particular though, was the fact that i was filming in (black and white mode). there is a shot when u can actually see violet or red when the craft rotates.. it's earlier in the video as it moves above the trees furthest to the right. when i saw it i was excited and anxious. i went to the back to step out for a better look and that's just what i got.. so good of a clear look that i didn't immediately go outside, i kind of got scared and froze, hanging half in half out of the deck door until erin approached from behind with the camera and i wasn't alone, is when i stepped out and started to shoot. i had a range of emotions during and after. after i felt like i wanted more contact, felt almost certain there would be and more regularly. i felt angry, because i know we are not being told the truth. i felt that we saw a ufo or something supernatural. i lost sight of it because it juked me outta my shoes, just saying that it moved in way as to cause me to lose sight of it. as i'm filming the last couple seconds of footage, i observe the object get kind of fat and blurry and then it was gone. since then i've watched the video and now know what happened. it made a move to the right as if it was gong to fly out view, so i'm thinking it's gone, but no, it just vanished for a second then reappeared in the same spot but reversing direction

investigators and a witness to previous events at her home in independence, mo near the missouri river.  the location has been the site of an ongoing investigation with photos of unexplained objects, strange sparkles that fell from a ufo and affected vegitation, an et in the witness' bedroom, low flying craft, and unexplained objects observed by the investigators.We arrived at the home at approximately 8:00 p.M. to set up equipment and visit with the witness. we were hoping to get more evidence since the witness and her husband often see things at this location and our investigative team has also witnessed unexplained events there in the past. we all saw several strange unexplained things in the sky last night such as a bright white object which blinked on, then off, then on and off again, and a bright orange object with another smaller one next to it. at about 10:35 p.M. we all observed a single large white round object which flew very high at a high rate of speed from ne to e then blinked out. at about 10:40 p.M. i was sitting in a chair and another investigator stood to my right and back a couple of feet when i noticed what i thought was the investigator bending over very low - i saw what i thought was his head in my peripheral vision but when i turned to the right to see what he was doing it was actually an extraterrestrial standing there. he had no hair, tan skin, was approximately 3 1/2' tall, had a thin muscular body, thin mouth, small nose, not extremely large eyes, long face with pointed chin, and a head in proportion to the body or just slightly larger. he was either wearing a tight jumpsuit or no clothing. it shocked me, to say the least. i told everyone what i saw and grabbed my flir to check the area and check the ground for a heat signature left by the feet but there was nothing. i was again looking forward, when in my peripheral vision saw what i thought was the investigator moving forward. i looked to my right and there was the et again. he disappeared as soon as i looked straight at him. i then got the impression that the entity had been there all along and that he was observing us. we then all got our cameras and started taking pictures. a few minutes later i again saw what i thought was the investigator move forward and when i turned my head to look it was the entity, inches from my face, bent over slightly and he turned his head and stared right at me with a look on his face as if he were surprised that i could see him. i got out of the chair, put my hand out where i saw him, then walked through the area where he was standing and actually felt some type of energy go through me. i had the distinct impression that this entity was there to observe us all. i felt that this was important to report as the witness in this case since i was the only one who saw the entity.

the smith & wesson factory in springfield,ma approaching the corner of roosevelt and bay street when i looked up and seen a chrome orb in the sky. it wasn't moving, floating or hovering meaning it was completely still or i couldn't see any movement from the distance i was at. it was lower than what a commercial plane would be maybe as high as what a single engine plane or a helicopter would fly at. i thought to myself \"i'm having a ufo encounter right now\". i tried to get as much detail as possible but i was also telling myself i must be crazy and kept walking like it was nothing. then i glanced back up maybe 30 seconds to 1 minute later and it was gone. then i knew i wasn't just seeing things. at this point (literally 1-2 mins since i first glanced up and seen the object) i was at the bottom of the hill and standing at the corner of roosevelt and bay street and i looked around in the sky for the object and spotted it off in the distant. i mean way off in the distance. it first looked like it was just over the corner of roosevelt and bay due south and now the object was miles in the distance. i only stopped looking at it and continued walking for 1 minute, say 5 minutes max if i'm exaggerating or miss remembering but for it to go from a few hundred feet from me to the distance i seen it at after i looked away was impossible for current aircraft and amazing. there was also a skyscraper(commercial plane) off in the distance to the sw. this gave me proof of it's distance and what i was seeing was not a plane. it was chrome, spherical but more egg shaped than perfectly round, it was large like a plane like hot air balloon size. i have better than 20/20 vision, i've always been told by friends i have excellent vision. i was not seeing things. i was not on drugs, drunk or in any way impaired. in short, i saw a floating chrome orb in the sky and it went from right above me to off miles in the distance (about as far as my eyes could see) within a matter of minutes. there was also a skyscraper traveling across the sky slowly which put the objects speed in perspective. it was sunny out with barely any clouds. **i am not saying i seen the object move it moved when i looked away for a couple minutes.** then when i looked up again it was gone and i looked sw and seen it far off, still hovering/floating/just sitting there. i did not see it in motion. \r\n\r\nalso while i was writing this i just remembered....Weeks or months after my sighting i was riding in to work with a classmate and he seen the object too. this time i did not. we were about a quarter mile north on roosevelt turning onto cottage street while mid-conversation my classmate stopped talking and was looking in the sky to the north. i asked him what was wrong and he said nothing he saw something in the sky. i immediately though about my sighting and joked and said \"what a ufo?\" , he laughed and said \"yes actually\", i asked was it chrome and sphere shaped? he looked at me with a surprised look and said yes it was. this confirmed for me i wasn't crazy and what i saw that day was real. \r\n\r\nwhy this is classified as a ufo and strange for me:\r\n\r\n1. it was just a chrome sphere but big like a hot air balloon just sitting in the sky. but there was no basket, no movement at all, and it looked metallic. \r\n\r\n2. how was it just sitting there? not floating, not hovering, completely still\r\n\r\n3. how did it go from right above me couple hundred feet away and up in the sky to off in the distance as far as my eyes can see in a matter of a minute or minutes? a skyscraper traveling a few hundred miles per hours was also in the sky inching its way across the sky like a turtle. this thing went from point a to point b after looking away for a moment like it teleported or something. \r\n\r\n4. what i seen was weird and unexplained and completely a mystery to me.
