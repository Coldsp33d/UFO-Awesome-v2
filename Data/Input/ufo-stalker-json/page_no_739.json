awakening  and to this very day. the dream was very very real. involved many abductees. i want to know if others have reported same experience mid-june 1992 san gabriel valley in foothills of the san gabiel mountains, angeles national forest.  \r\n\r\nthe events:\r\n\r\ni am reading in the middle of the night as i often did back then. noticed the time. about 3 a,m. then i doze off...Or do i?\r\n\r\nthe dream:  it is the middle of night.  i am awake in bed. my wife is sound asleep. she is next to me. a funny sensation overcomes me. a stillness. i begin to levitate above my bed. i grab my wife. she remains asleep. together we rise above the bed and float feet first through the bedroom doorway down the hall into the living room into the laundry room and out the back door. now outside we slowly rise above the house and into the air. we reach an altitude of several hundred feet possibly 1,000 ft. semi paralyzed i am able to look around and i see dozens of others in their pajamas floating through the air feet first like us. we are all moving in the same direction toward an unknown destination. i am able to see across  the san gabriel valley from a perspective of several hundred possibly a thousand feet above the ground. the valley lights, street lights, car lights, commercial lights light the valley in the normal way.\r\n\r\nwe abductees continue to float slowly. we eventually land in a field not far from our house possibly a thousand meters away..  beings in space suits attend to each of us.  a ufo is parked nearby in the field. the beings are administering shots. the one who gives us our shots, my wife's and mine removes her helmet and smiles. she is very asian in appearance with long black hair. \r\n\r\ni awake, the dream has ended and my wife and i are back in bed...Or did we ever leave? was it real or a dream? my wife remained asleep through the entire dream and has no memory of it. however, we both notice the next day that our upper arms are sore...As if we each had had a vaccination. \r\n\r\ndream two:  the very next night about the same time a second dream takes place. this time i hear a vehicle drive up our driveway. the property is five acres in size and the driveway is long, about 100 feet. i do not hear a gas engine purring. i instead hear wheels rolling on the ground. judging from the sound the vehicle rolls right up to our bedroom and parks. three sides of the bedroom walls are walls of glass. the drapes are drawn. i cannot see outside. suddenly i am paralyzed and then begin to rise above the bed. i float feet first right through the wall. i am now outside and can see an odd futuristic looking four wheel vehicle the size of an army tank. i float into it. i do not notice anyone in the vehicle. this vehicle then drives forward. i can see outside. it moves off the edge of the hill that drops off next to our bedroom and moves into another place, another dimension possibly. \r\n\r\nthe next string i know i am in a rural,town. there is a human looking being nearby. i begin to run. he reaches for me. i pop him in the face which jars his face which then falls to the ground. he is a robot. i run...\r\n\r\nthe

farmington nm. it was late at night around 11:00pm as i was traveling north on hwy 550 just outside the town of san ysidro when i noticed that the stars were particularly bright in the eastern sky. i didn't think anything of this as the stars are often quite bright in new mexico when one is away from city lights, especially during colder weather. as i crossed into the jemez rez. i noticed that there was a ringing in my ears. again i didn't think anything of this as i was driving home after a long flight from louisiana evaluating large natural gas processing turbines at a processing facility and figured that i had been exposed to a bit to much high frequency noise. i turned on the radio and searched for a radio station out of texas that is the only one receivable in the remote area to drown out the ringing, only this time there were no am station that my truck radio could receive. i turned off the radio and noticed that the radio was still making a humming noise. again i didn't think much of this as company vehicles often have electronic accessories such as lap tops, cell phones, booster, etc. that can cause this issue. although this problem didn't exist until then. again i didn't think anything about this as i just wanted to get home and had a long drive ahead. there were no other vehicles on the highway either north or south bound though this to is not unusual on 550 at time of night. i was trying to organize my thoughts to the report that i was to file the following day when i noticed out of the passenger window a group of what seemed like 3 stars on the horizon above the mountains that were almost keeping pace with my speed. my first thought was they were aircraft. shortly there after there was a 4th light and again i didn't pay much attention as the 4 corners area often sees multiple commercial aircraft passing overhead. about 5 mins later another light appeared then another and again another in the shape of a horizontal arc. i have seen many odd lights at night during my career in the oil and gas ind. so to me it was just another curiosity. the lights however didn't go away and continued to pace my vehicle. i pulled over at a turn-around to relieve myself and noticed that there were 2 other shapes with the same pattern of lights that seemed to be at different altitudes slightly to the northeast and the southwest. at this time i noticed that they were no longer moving but seemed stationary. the lights to the northeast seemed to have a shape that was illuminated by what i assumed was the city lights of santa fe to the east. i truly believed that this was a cloud or something that was playing tricks on the eye at i was tired, so i entered my truck and opened a soda and turned the ignition. the truck had a had time starting which was strange as all company vehicle are fleet maintained and regularly serviced. the truck did start on the 5th try, i made a note to have the truck in for service and pulled back onto the highway. i glanced over and noticed that the arc of lights appeared to have moved closer and again seemed to keep pace with my vehicle. i also noticed that as the lights moved along that the stars in the background would disappear like something was passing in front of them. i increased speed to about 85mph then 95mph which are common speeds late at night on this stretch of highway and with each speed change (faster and slower) the lights kept exact pace. at this time i was becoming nervous and was looking forward to arriving in cuba nm where i would stop and fuel up and wait awhile. entering cuba nm is very distinct as anyone who has travel in the area knows that police repeatedly patrol the area looking for speeders. i was honestly hoping to see a state trooper. the lights kept following my vehicle and drifting closer toward the highway to a point that they seemed to take up the entire passenger side windows of the crew-cab 1/2 ton chevrolet pickup. i began to feel nauseous and i could hear the ringing in my ears over the sound of the whine of the tires on the asphalt. i was becoming quite disturbed at this time and was beginning to desperately look for the lights of cuba. i remember clearly that i was traveling at 103mph, the trucks top speed when the lights passed overhead and blocked out the stars and cast what seemed like a shadow over the area. the starlight was gone for possibly 10 seconds and then drifted back toward the northeast and then raised up and was gone. i saw street lights in the distance and assumed that i was finally reaching cuba nm. i slowed to the posted speed limit of 70 mph and felt somewhat relieved that what ever was going on was over. as i neared closer to the street lights they were quite different form the lights of cuba ( with which i am very familiar with as i have made this drive many times) i continued to slow as i approached the lights and realized that they were the yard lights of what is known as hill top store, a gas station and store 10 miles from bloomfield nm. almost 100 miles from where i believed i was. i have absolutely no memory of traveling this distance. no memory of passing through cuba or a number of other small settlements and landmarks that are used to gage distances at night. the ringing in my ears was gone along with the nausea, and the truck was functioning normally with 3/4 of a tank of fuel. the clock in the truck was exactly 1 hour and 38 minutes slower than the wall clock within hill top store. i was shaken and took about 20-30 min to gather myself then continued home. during the next 3 weeks i  experienced odd rashes on my body and sleep issues as well as other changes. i used to have black/dark brown hair which then began to turn spotty grey. there are times when i feel unexplainably tired and confused since this incident. i do not understand what may have happened and don't know what may or may not be taking place. i am a professional in the energy industry and need answers.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

1973. i have not witness anything unusual since then untill recently. i was driving my work van back from victoria, tx. near rosenberg, tx i happen to look up in the sky at some dark clouds and as they parted a little i saw what i thought was a strange looking flag. i wanderd to myself what kind of flag is that?Some trees were blocking my vision somewhat & when i passed them by i could tell that this was not a flag since it was very large & about 1/2 - 1 mile up in the air. it was a throw pillow shaped object about 250 by 300ft at least. it was just hovering there. if i had been in any other spot i probably would not of noticed it. it looked goldish orange to me at the time but realized later when thinking about it it was probably silver & reflecting the morning orange sky off the surface of the object. the reason i thought it was flag at first was that it was fluttering like a flag would sort off, but it was just the 4 corners that were waving around. did not look real like something out of a futuriztic syfy movie but not like i had seen before. it was not horizontal with the ground but the object was upright like if a flag would be. it was quite large with what looked like some sort of round whitish circle in the middle. it took a couple minutes or so to dawn on me that this was a large object just hovering there in the air. looked like it was using the dark clouds to hide behind. it has taken a couple of days to sink in that this was nothing i ever saw or even thought of before. haven't been able to stop thinking about it. i kept saying tomyself was this a obtical illusion or something but i have come to realize i saw something that was no way normal. it was something i never even imagined a ufo would look like. i can't stop thinking about it. either i actually saw something that is not of this earth as far as i know or i was hullucinating.","distance":"Over One

route.\r\nas i progressed in a southerly direction on haverhill road in west palm beach, i happened to notice several glowing, red-orange orbs alternately hovering and sometimes rapidly accelerating, travelling in a west to east course. at first, it was very striking to see this, because i estimate at least 10 orbs were moving in odd formations, but it appeared as if they at the same time had some sort of eventual destination. it was difficult to judge the size of the orbs, as their motion was quite frenetic at times.\r\nmy mind began to try to dissect what it could have been. the palm beach international airport is nearby, but i know for certain there's no way these were airliners, learjets, military craft or helicopters.\r\nafter about 30 seconds they started to approach my position, near the intersection of haverhill rd. and belvedere rd.\r\ni almost caused an accident as i veered into another lane inadvertently as i was trying to get a good view of the objects/craft.\r\neventually, after maybe 20- 40 seconds, the craft were past my position, and i took my right to turn on belvedere rd. to proceed to the gym, but i could barely see the craft when i peered over my right shoulder, and there were 4-6 orbs left at this point. i looked back after taking a peak at the road in front of me, and when i looked back towards the eastern sky, they were gone ! my view was also severely obstructed by trees and power lines by this time. \r\ni'm certain, with the way these objects moved, and the speeds at which they moved, they weren't man-made and most likely not of this earth, or dimension. they made a bizarre hissing sound at first, but as i watched them, i noticed they seemed to be moving silently, but deftly. they had a certain agility to them that evoked a subtly frightening and eerie feeling.\r\ni've tried to be fair and take every possibility into account, including flares, meteors/space debris, balloons, helicopters, planes... but, what i saw was none of those earthly things.\r\nit was a fascinating and mesmerizing sight that i won't soon forget.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1
