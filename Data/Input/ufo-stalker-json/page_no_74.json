something at my home. it was night and dark with a clear sky. i stopped; we got out of my car. i immediately noticed the sky was unusual. i pointed it out to my friend. we both looked up and slightly to the west. we commented that it was unusual and it didn't make sense. my friend said he was in a hurry and left to get his item. i continued to observe the sky. what i/we saw was a circular \"void\". no idea of its distance from the ground but i might guess it to be 500 feet. i remember thinking it was the area of a city block. the sky was clear and there were stars from horizon to horizon, except there were no stars in this area above us. i, we have seen clouds in the night sky that block the stars and this sky had no clouds. this void was not a cloud. the void was the same color as the background night sky ie black. this void was the exactly the same black color just that it seemed to have the stars removed from it. i stared at it and tried to determine if the \"stars\" around its perimeter were a ufo's lights. i was disappointed because i could not determine one way or the other. then after a minute or two my friend returned. i commented that i could not figure out what we were looking at. he glanced up and agreed. but he was late and we had to go, so we did not continue our observation. i was hoping i was seeing a ufo at the time but i didn't \"see\" anything, so i dismissed the idea. i was disappointed but remained puzzled. another friend and his family had observed a ufo years earlier and i hoped i was seeing one too. \r\n\r\ni forgot about the incident for the last 37 years until another friend told me of his ufo siting. i decided to contact mufon because others might be interested in what i \"didn't\" see.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Note – we tried to provide coordinates for the approximate locations where these events occurred. the logging roads in this area generally remain the same today but some of the old logging roads have become unused and almost hidden though evidence of them can still be seen on google maps and google earth.\r\n\r\noverview:\r\n\r\nthis is a true account that has not been invented or embellished. it has only been discussed by the participants with family members and a very few select friends. this is the type of event that changes one’s perspective of the world. we are both grounded in science and the scientific method, in reasoning and believed there was a plausible explanation; one has yet to come to light. what we witnessed was close, occurred over a lengthy period of time, and ultimately defied the laws of physics and aerodynamics as we understood them.\r\n\r\nobserver background:\r\n\r\nboth observers witnessing this incident were adults, approximately 31 and 21 years old. both were us navy veterans at the time, one having 8 years in naval aviation in various aircrew and avionics roles including experience working nights for 70% of those 8 years. that work experience is relevant to this incident in that it included working at night around jet, turbine, and rotary-engine aircraft including fixed wing and helicopters at various naval air stations and aboard 3 different aircraft carrier flight decks while working 12 hours shifts at night as a flight deck troubleshooter. this included many months at sea and on flight lines in varying weather conditions observing high speed carrier-based fighter and bomber aircraft operations and low speed approaches as well as helicopter operations. the other observer had served a gunner’s mate aboard a us navy frigate and had combat experience aboard that vessel. both were experienced watch-standers, trained observers, possessed extensive experience in night operations, and were accustomed to working in extreme conditions under duress for long periods. both observers grew up in the local area where the incident occurred, both had extensive experience in the woods around that area specifically, in addition to familiarity with seasonal local weather phenomenon. both were avid hunters, campers, outdoorsmen and were former boy scouts and athletes. neither has any problems with substance abuse or mental illness. both observers are college educated and have advanced degrees.\r\n\r\nincident:\r\n\r\nafter a day at the shooting range, and deciding to take the long way home through one of our favorite areas, our vehicle became stuck when trying to work around a large and deep mud hole in the road just on north side of the old wooden logging bridge crossing the saint marks river (30.320229, -84.128186), approximately 300 yards northeast of horn springs fl (30.319167, -84.128535) southeast of tallahassee florida. this road is shown today on the map as private road 2512 in leon county fl. because this occurred prior to cell phones, it was necessary to hike out to the area near the intersection of ww kelly, tram and old plank roads in order to reach homes that might have a phone we could call for assistance (30.370446, -84.126316). we took the rifles with us, locked the car and started what we believed would be an estimated 4 to 5-mile hike in the dark. \r\n\r\nthe temperature was in the low-40’s as we departed the vehicle in full darkness however, the night was fairly brighter in the clear-cut areas and as the moon rose slightly that evening. the cloud cover had become broken to widely scattered, with a relatively high ceiling, at least 3,000 feet or higher. visibility was very good especially after moonrise.\r\n\r\nmost of the surrounding woods were, and probably remain, a mix of native hardwood hammocks with old growth pine, lowland palmetto swamps interspersed with planted long-leaf pine fields. there were numerous cleared expanses where timber operations had stripped the planted pines out for commercial use. we reached an unnamed logging road that ran north and west from what is now known as private road 2512. as we trekked along that narrower sand double track, we began hearing wild hogs squealing off in the distance to the east and south of us, probably within 50 to as far out as 200 yards. the grunting and squealing were common to us but it continued to occur for longer than would be expected. the number of hogs and the amount of squealing was unusual. we had used all of the ammo for the rifles at the range so, having no protection against the hogs, we stayed near the trees in case we need to get up off the ground quickly. we began moving a bit quicker just to put the hogs behind us but the noise continued. at one point, a large sow with several piglets burst out of the palmettos within 50 to 60 yards, crossing the road behind us. hogs are noisy but these were seemingly agitated that night so we were on alert for unwanted pig encounters as they can be quite dangerous. occasionally, i would turn around and walk backward in 1 of the tracks, just watching our rear area for hogs. \r\n\r\nwe had just come out of the trees, crossed a clear-cut area, and were about 100 yards from entering an area of low scrub oak when i noticed a light that appeared to be rising slowly off the ground, a light which then stopped about midway up the full height of the trees that were at the edge of the clearing (approximately 30.334774, -84.130406). this was the area we had just passed. we stopped and stood in the road discussing what this might be. we discussed the possibility that it was fog and being lit by the moonlight. the object seemed to be taking a more distinct shape and became almost cigar-shaped but having a flatter bottom than top, with the top having slightly more camber. it wasn’t really cigar or saucer-shaped but looked very aerodynamic like the cross-section of a jet wing yet not as tapered as a wing front to rear; this was more symmetrical from left to right. there was no dihedral from the angle we were viewing. as this more distinct shape was occurring, the object was lifting slightly and had reached nearly the same height as the trees behind it. there were no apparent appendages and no windows or portals.\r\n\r\nat about that time, we noticed there was a very faint change in color from dim white light to something in the pink/purple range but the color was almost imperceptible and seemed to be pulsing at a very low rate. there was absolutely no sound. at this point, we both notice the hogs had even become silent and simply thought it a coincidence. we stood and watched this object for what seemed like 5-10 minutes, from about 150 -200 yards away. during that time, we discussed the possible source of what we were seeing - fog, ice crystals, had we missed a new set of high power lines and this was some anomaly related to those things. we discussed it being a weather balloon, or group of helium balloons, or perhaps a parachute. we joked about this being a spacecraft and our being abducted and how would we know we hadn’t just been dropped off afterwards. it was tongue in cheek humor while we tried to rationalize this light and object. we discussed the possibility of a swarm of fireflies or possibly this being a band of foxfire we simply didn’t see when we passed it earlier. perhaps some form of lightning we hadn’t seen before. we considered each one until we exhausted all of the possibilities we could think of. it’s possible it could be any of those of something entirely different. we were being open minded because we both had experience misjudging distances and objects and direction at night in the military. at that moment, this was more of a curiosity to us than anything else. \r\n\r\nultimately, it was cold that sunday night and we still had a long way to go before getting to a phone and waking up a family member to come pick us up. everyone had to work the next morning. so, we continued our trek. i continued to walk backwards watching the light and, as we neared a sharp bend in the road, we stopped again. it almost appeared as if this object was following us up the road. we had travelled another 100-150 yards and the object appeared to be closer behind us and having moved from the original location as we moved (30.334449, -84.132233). this seemingly ruled out most of the rational sources we had discussed previously. we were more than just curious at what we were witnessing at this point. \r\n\r\nthe color was difficult to discern. it was almost necessary to look away slightly and view the object in one’s peripheral vision rather than look directly at it. the closest coloration i can think of is like that of annealed brass but it was infinitely subtler than that. or, it seemed like the air around the object was condensing water molecules and having an almost rainbow-like effect in the surface of the object, in moonlight! the color was pulsing at a very low rate. it had a strange translucent quality. none of this made sense and we did not know what we were witnessing.\r\n\r\nwe picked up our pace significantly and rounded a sharp turn to the left (30.333880, -84.135339). we had trees and a bend in the path between us and the object. we took off on a sprint and ran to the next big turn in the road, perhaps 100 – 125 yards away. we could not see the object from we stopped (30.332290, -84.135807). as we were catching our breath, we discussed how ridiculous this was but also asked the question, what will we do if that object rounds the turn in the road? we were standing in the middle of the double track, still puzzling over what plausible explanation there might be for what we were seeing. after a minute, the object rose over the trees beside the curve, moving slowly. there was no sound, no change in the quality of the light it was emitting, but the object was clearly moving. either we coincidentally happened to be getting in its track or it was following us. the object stopped and hung motionless in the night sky, about 80 feet above the ground and 80-100 yards away. in size, it appeared to be about 100-120 feet wide from our perspective. in the center, it seemed to be approximately 7-10 feet thick from top to bottom. it still made no sound and we could not discern how deep the object might be from front to back. the odd faint pulsing light and aura continued. still, we saw no appendages or openings in the object.\r\n\r\ncuriosity finally got the better of us and we started walking towards the object. we concluded we would resolve what this was right then. we had probably gone 20 yards when the object lifted higher off the ground, quite suddenly, and then moved off to the northeast, at a rate i have never seen any us or nato fighter aircraft move, even at mach speeds, and then climb in a long and incredibly unbelievable parabolic climb away from our location and up into the cloud layer and out of sight. we did not see the object again during the remainder of the hike out of the area.\r\n\r\nthe next day, after obtaining assistance getting the vehicle unstuck, i drove back to the location where we first saw the object the night before. it was a cold, clear and sunny morning. there i walked the area where the object appeared to rise off the ground and found no evidence that anything had been on the ground or near those trees. i drove the exact route we used to walk out the night before, stopping to walk those few areas where we thought the object had stopped. there was no evidence of any sort that could be found.\r\n\r\nsummation:\r\n\r\n1.\tin hindsight, we believe the hogs were coincidental and therefore unrelated to what we saw. \r\n2.\twe feel fairly certain that it was not local weather phenomenon such as fog, a low inversion layer, fireflies, foxfire, lightning, a parachute or balloons.\r\n3.\twhile we cannot explain what this object was, it was (a) moving, (b) appeared to be under control, and (c) seemed to be following us (or we happened to travel in its intended path).\r\n4.\tthe object departed the area at a speed that cannot be accomplished by any known aircraft.\r\n5.\tthe object departed in complete silence.\r\n6.\tthere was no wind, no vortices, and no sound barrier being broken yet it left at a rate of speed much higher than the sound barrier.\r\n7.\tthe trees and foliage around the area were undisturbed upon its exit.\r\n8.\tthe g-forces that would have been imparted on a human at that speed would be not be survivable.\r\n9.\twe simply do not know what we witnessed that night.\r\n10.\tit remains an incredibly fascinating experience and a great unexplained mystery. \r\n11.\tneither of us have seen anything like this since but at least one of us would welcome a chance to see it again.\r\n\r\n\r\nfootnote:\r\n\r\nwithout ever having discussed the incident above, a co-worker once relayed his experience as an mp sergeant, in the florida national guard, of his unit being assigned to guard an air force mobile radar unit near camp blanding florida, where there were supposedly numerous reports of an object of similar description having been seen multiple times leaving wooded remote areas similar to our experience in the florida panhandle. according to his story, the air force had received calls about such incidents such that it caused them to put several mobile radar units in the area over a few months and various national guard units were assigned to provide site security. the context of our discussion was along the lines of crazy things we did in the military but i never shared my story with him about my night in the woods. the two completely different locations and descriptions seem to have possible correlation since they occurred relatively closely geographically and within a few years of each other.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

seen alot, i guess u could say a sympathy card because before i had videos and witnesses i was looked at as crazy which i wasn't so i was pretty quiet but people like to make things up and act like ur actually crazy and add there own details to my life so i didn't even have chances with new people in my area because someone from my past would know them so i think who ever fly's these things feels like i should be known as a regular person and not some joke left to rot and be miserable.  anyway i see stuff alot now days and by will. the videos im going to post kinda prove that aspect seeming they r all outside of my home and in one video i even give a little bit of instructions so it goes along with what i'm saying. the other two videos are pretty good too one seems like how the phoenix lights were and the other video has a craft flying towards me then over head beaming a laser out of it.  i have other videos of course and like i said i see stuff at will do if anyone at mufon would like to talk to me and maybe have me on a show or something we could even make a movie for all i care,  i have never seen anyone connect with em the way i do, sometimes i'm even skeptical of showing certain people because i do get the occasional scaredy cat who has to run and hide which i do my best to say all is good,  i have never made direct contact nor have i ever been abducted which is good, but i can assure u unless our world governments have sick tech to accomplish warp speed with a v shape craft the size of a navy ship then they gotta be from another planet but who knows right. over all get back to me asap,  i have been wanting to contact y'all to get this ball on the road and i will be moving to la in january so i won't be far and i have all kinds of things people have never seen,  for the times we live in right now i think the world needs someone like myself...  i would like to get that side of stuff more adjusted before making it public bank cause the topic is so touched,  don't want people to think it's related to religion or anything like that because it's something the complete opposite which is to help all the lost people seeing life for what it truly isn't,  like i said when i get into town we can work on that together but for now check the videos and tell me what u think ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

pa.  i had gone to bed after all the 2nd shift medics finished their shifts and went to sleep.  i was wide awake because i had worked the third shift the night before and slept during the night and late into the afternoon.  i was lying on the top bunk when i noticed movement towards the foot end of the bunk.  when i first noticed the object i didn't know what it was but it was able to move through a solid object, the window panes and the wooden frames.  the pastel peach colored gaseous cloud that i observed moved through the window and along the left side of my bunk where it started to ascend to the top of the post which supported the ceiling in the bunk area.  i believe there was a metal bracket at the top of the post. it started to coalesce into an object that was about 18 inches to 2 feet in length and 9 to 10 inches in height. at the 4 corners the object sloped at a 45 degree angle and the ends were about 3 inches high and perpendicular to the top and bottom. the upper and lower halves of the object seemed to have 6 or 7 coal black window looking objects and the body of the object started to glow like a hot coal.  it gave off an orange light that lit up the bunk area.  then it seemed to pulsate as though it was making observations of its surroundings.  after a few minutes the object seemed to cool down like a coal that was burning out.  then it collapsed in upon itself, in an instant, disappearing entirely from sight.  during the encounter there was no sound at all. while this was happening i was frightened because i didn't know what was happening.  i could not explain how this object materialized and dematerialized right in front of my eyes.  after a minute or so while the object was there i tried to whisper out to my fellow medics so they could observe what i was seeing.  they were all sound asleep.  the next morning i was sitting on my bunk after dressing for the day.  a medic who just came off the 3rd shift asked me what was i so perplexed about.  i explained what i saw and his jaw dropped.  i then asked him what his look was about.  he said on the third shift a medic came to the emergency room to get first aid for a burn he suffered from placing his hand on a doorknob at the end of one of the many hallways at the hospital.  the next work shift i told my md friend about my sighting.  he laughed and said \"what have you been smoking.\"  i never took mind altering drugs of any kind.  i saw what i saw and to this day i can't explain it.  i never mention it to anyone because i would be looked upon as a mentally touched individual.  i will be 70 years old in a few months and have a serious medical condition.  i am writing this so that it is seen before i pass on and that it won't be lost forever.  thank you for your kind attention.

two objects that looks like bright stars were going from east through the sky with extraordinary speed like one \"star\" was chasing another and very close to each other on visual field of sky about 1 inch from each other, then when they approached about middle of the sky or right above out heads, first one without slowing it's speed made about 90 degree turn and one that follow it just stopped right in the center of our visual field. first \"star\" without slowing down flew to north side of the sky until we no longer can see it. we lost track of the second one as it stopped and mixed up among other stars. to give an estimate how fast they were going that entire event took about 10-13 seconds. i am physician and like to reading about technology and with certainty can say that there are no human made objects that can fly with such speed through sky at very high altitude, basically from horizon to horizon for about 10+ seconds, make 90 degree turn at such speed and especially make sudden stop from high speed path. four of us witnessed that event and we all were amazed and recollected about what we had seen. unfortunately as murphy law none of us were filming it, as we were fascinated looking at what we saw. although i thought about it but regular cell phone camera unfortunately  is not sensitive enough to records movement of the stars.

made me aware of this, we were in the bathroom. my daughter was in the tub playing and i was in the mirror getting ready.\r\nmy daughter randomly out of no where said, \"mama a monster came to me\" i had her repeat what she said, and tried to make light of it by saying \"oh yeah?\" \r\nmy daughter then told me a story of her new friend monster and monsters family, who were described as one being blue and the other being green (her monster she refers to is always green, but she says his brother is blue), they had no hair, wore no clothing, did not speak to her & they did something to her forehead. her elaboration on my questions was short and at times she did not want to answer most of the questions, she always went back and forth with liking these beings to stating she was afraid (she seems conflicted). on this occasion she said there were 2 monsters that were siblings that came to her, they took her to the beings mother and father. who were also beings. she said she likes monster even though he did not speak, i asked her why she called him monster she said she gave him that name because he was ugly. she also said where she went had a playground, was beautiful with, babies and lots of rainbows.\r\nwhen i asked where monster came from she paused then pointed up at my ceiling then giggled. hours later i asked her again in front of her father who monster was & the same questions i had asked her earlier that day which she answered the same responses in front of her dad. after this she did not want to talk about this encounter anymore.\r\nmy next encounter my daughter made claims of was last week.\r\nshe told me monster came to her again, but this time he brought a very \"cute\" man. when i asked her what the cute man looked like she said he had blond hair and blues. she said he wore clothing and the same being she calls monster (the green one) was with the cute blond man. i asked her again similar questions as i did before, like did you go anywhere with them, did they speak to you, what did they look like ( i am careful not to ask questions to lead her in answers, to be sure she is not getting ideas from my questions to respond) so instead of saying \"did he have blue eyes\" i say \"what color were his eyes?\" or \"what did he look like\".\r\nthis encounter my daughter described a tree house in a jungle on their ship that also has a playground. she said the cute man showed her a beautiful book. my daughter then stated she was afraid and did not want to talk about monster anymore.\r\nmy daughter has not been subjected to alien movies or ideas of this nature other then normal tv. i believe what is happening to my daughter at this time, to be real events. \r\ni will have to wait till she's older to ask her if it is her imagination or if something else really is going on. either way i am not afraid and i understand there's nothing i can really do to stop it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":88916,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.58544576609556,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12192017-0018","longitude":-72.22117085964528,"occurred":1508025600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,
