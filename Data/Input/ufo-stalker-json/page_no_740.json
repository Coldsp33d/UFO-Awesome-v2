same length. my windows were down and i heard no sound from it at all. i stopped not far from the end of linker rd. and watched it for a moment and then made a left onto st. peter's ch rd still watching it. i got up to the graveyard on the right and that's when it dove behind the trees in the far distance and did not come back up. i had no camera and no phone on me when i saw it. i have searched for this for years on the internet for this object and have never found much of anything that looks like it. i have found other photos of y-shaped crafts that others have seen but none of

end street. no one some of these things until in was in my 20's. my sister thought it was a dream that terrified her. my brother just mentioned it last week while watching hanger 1. \r\ni have no memory of leaving my bedroom, which was upstairs. i think i was 7 or 8. i would wake up in the empty field beside our house. sometimes i was alone, sometimes my sister was with me. on one occasion, and there were many, i was alone in the field, looking up at all these objects in the sky. they were of various shapes and sizes. they made humming or low frequency buzzing noises. it seemed the only one that terrified me was the upside down cone: it was a dull whiteish color but it had a black dot at the tip that swirled upwards as it floated in the air. it scared me badly...I thought it was bad.\r\ni wanted to run away from it, but couldn't move as if literally frozen with fear. i would wake up the next mornings, still feeling the fear, but didn't talk about it. \r\nanother time, the pixies would come and get me. they would be with me in my room, but then we'd be someplace else. it seemed i would be in my elementary school, and they were floating outside the building. i could see them wanting me to float with them, but i was running down the school steps to get away from them. i thought it was a game.\r\none time the policies came and took me someplace different. i was never afraid of the policies. they were short, like me, and they were always smiling. the didn't have any hair, but that was okay because they were dixies. \r\nanyway, this time they took me to a big, silvery white room with other people standing around...But not people. i don't remember what they did, but two of the policies holding my hands were saying...\"don't be afraid little girl. don't be afraid.\"\r\nthe next tim i woke up, i was in a circular type room where these cold silver slabs came out from the walls for beds. \r\ni woke up, naked with a sheet blanket covering me from my neck to my knees. i couldn't move really well. i turned to look to my left and there was an adult man, who was asleep with the same type of blanket on him.\r\ntoward the bend of the room, which had subdued lighting around the rim at the top of the room, i heard a swish sound. as i was coming more awake, i started to sit up. at the door was this insect-reptilian type thing with its arms crossed, smearing at me. suddenly the two policies came in, laid me down took my hands and were telling me not to be afraid. they always called me little girl.\r\none of the scariest was when they had taken both my sister and myself. there were the usual ships in the air, including that cone, which terrified my sister more than it did me. \r\nsuddenly there was a very tall man dressed in a long white robe. the others seemed afraid of him. although he stood back a few feet, he told me to get my sister to the little walnut tree which was in our yard. he said if we would stand with our arms around it, one on each side, and hug each other tight, staying under the branches of the tree, we'd be safe and they couldn't take us. my sister will not talk about this to this day. \r\njust last week out of the blue, my brother asked me if i remembered those things that came in the field while we were outside playing and we would run inside crying, because we were afraid. strangely, he remembers the daytime encounters while i do not.\r\nthe ones i remember all took place at night. \r\nfor the past several years, i've always known when they were coming. i don't know how often they've managed to get me. i can tell you that i wake up fighting and kicking them.  the last i remember was two years ago. \r\nsince i fell, two and a half years ago, i can sometimes feel them around but i don't think they're taking me.\r\nfor years i tried to sketch that thing in the doorway of that room. finally a  year ago, i was able to draw it, and the room. i have felt better since then.\r\ni have had prerogative dreams since my early teens. sometimes as i'm going to sleep i can see my room as if my eyes are open even though i know they're closed. i know things about people that i have no business knowing. \r\ni've explained things as best as i'm able. \r\nit's not easy, and sometimes i still feel the anxiety. \r\noh, and...Lights in the sky still make me afraid until i can figure out what it is. \r\nthanks for reading this. i don't know what you may make of it, but, there it is. \r\none more thing, i other abductees seem drawn to me without knowing whyet i always know.  \r\nif i can answer any questions, just ask. \r\nthanks","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

lake on highway 97, i spotted a craft that i initially thought to be a huge kite and pointed it out to my wife. the highway traveld in a southerly direction and the craft seemed to be paralleling the highway and the fraser river, the river being approx. 1/2 mile to our west. as we drove along, the object was traveling nearly at our speed of 60 mph and seemed to be across the river another mile or more. we had a very good view of the object and there was a trailing apparatus below the craft and it appeared to be of a very heavy chain or cable with a little larger object at its trailing end. that is what made me first think of a kite, but it wasn't stationary. the trailing cable was at about a 35 degree angle from the bottom of the craft.\r\nat a convienient pullout with a clear view of the craft i pulled over and took out my binoculars for a quick look and my camera, a kodak easyshare z950 and zoomed in on the object for a photo, but it wouldn't seem to focus clearly on it, kept going in and out of focus. it seemed to be somewhat transparent through the viewfinder and with the binoculars, but was clearer with the naked eye. the trailing tail looked to be at least two hundred feet or more in length and i now suspected the object at its end was an apparatus that may have been collecting data, for i was now positive it was not a canadian aircraft of any sort i have seen. i am a professional land surveyor with over 45 years of experience, and observations are most relvant to that occupation. the photo 1 has some nearby pine trees above the craft, a triangular shape with a deffinate protrussion at the top and bottom of its rear end and a long, elogated additional wing, if i may, at the bottom of the craft from near the front tapering toward the rear. there was a bit of a haze look across the valley, but when i first saw the object it appeared much clearer than the photo and was below the main cloud cover. one lower cloud can be seen somewhat , in front of the object. \r\ni got back in the car and traveled on southward and thought if i sped up some i could get a little closer and get another photo. but as i sped up, so did the object and the long heavy trailing cable was now at a 50 degree angle, proving it had speeded up also. i stopped and got the photo 2 at a further distance away, but it doesn't show a great deal other than its semi transparency. that tree line on the horizon appeared to me to be two to three miles away and the object appeared to be even further. the tallest trees on that horizon are probably not over 100 ft. in height, which gives the impression that this craft is very large.\r\ni kept up my speed as some lower mountains i would enter would obstruct the view and hoped to see the object again as i neared the top of the hill trending down into williams lake, but the craft was never seen again. i'm certain other southbound drivers saw this same object, but i've not run across any other report. perhaps you have.

(see map – ufo noticed)    there was a slight sound, like exhaling gently through pursed lips.  (not a whistle, just a sound of air in motion).  \r\n•\twe immediately jumped in the 4wd pickup, and began to follow the craft northward, across the brownwood peninsula subdivision.\r\n•\tthe craft crossed the shoreline at the south end of burnet bay.  it proceeded about 75-100 yards offshore, turned slightly eastward, and stopped. (see map - observation 2)\r\n•\tthe craft remained stationary for about ten minutes, slightly “bobbling” as if floating. it did not change heading or altitude. our viewpoint was from the right-rear of the craft.  we both exited our truck and observed it through 7 x 50 binoculars.  we had no camera.\r\n•\twe remained there until the craft started moving northward across burnet bay, then we gave chase again.   we drove to bayway drive and turned north.   decker drive, (now spur 330) was under construction.  there was a huge mound of dirt for an overpass foundation.  i drove my 4wd up on top of the mound.  (see map – observation 3)\r\n•\twe observed the craft cross the decker drive right-of-way about ¾ mile west of us, still at very low altitude, moving less than ten miles per hour.\r\n•\twe spun the truck around and went down the dirt mound, back onto bayway drive, and turned north.   the street name changes from bayway drive to thompson road as it crosses cedar bayou – lynchburg road.    \r\n•\tmoving north on thompson road, just before passing under interstate 10, we observed the craft moving northward, about ½ mile west of us, still very low and slow.                 (see map – observation 4)\r\n•\twe raced north on thompson road to get ahead of the craft, then turned west onto jones road.  we saw the craft coming, and stopped directly in its path.   \r\n•\tthe craft directly overflew us at an altitude of 100-125 feet, about three times as high as the telephone poles.   it was not yet dark, but i turned on my truck spotlight, and directed the beam onto the bottom of the craft, more to elicit some sort of response, rather than to see with.  (see map – observation 5)\r\n•\tin the bright light, we both observed centerline bay doors on the bottom of the craft.  possibly for landing gear or weapons.    (see drawing for details)\r\n•\tafter the overflight, the craft banked slightly, turning more toward the east.  we turned around, and raced back to thompson road.  we turned north, and raced to east houston street, and proceeded to the dead end.  (see map – observation 6)    \r\n•\tthere we observed the craft cross the south shoreline of the highlands reservoir, and proceed northeast out of sight beyond the levee.    (see map – ufo vanished)   \r\n•\twe lost sight of the craft, and had no path to get ahead of it, so we returned home.  \r\n\r\nend of observation.\r\nduration: approximately 45 minutes.  \r\n\r\npost observation discussion and retrospection:\r\nwe could not come up with an apt term to describe the color of the craft’s marker lights.  there were three dim lights, one at each corner of the triangular shape, about as bright as 25 watt bulbs.   the color was “pinkish-orange”.   there were no other lights at any time.  the “marker” lights remained lighted during the entire observation.  the lights were integral with the craft, and not “attached” to it.\r\n\r\nthe plan shape was an isosceles triangle, about 40 feet wide, and 80 feet long.\r\nthe cross section was a flattened diamond shape.  the rear was 40 feet wide, and 10 feet high at the middle.  this shape tapered to a point at the front end.  the external surfaces were planar, with no curved surfaces on the outside.  all edges appeared to be sharp.\r\n\r\nthere was no discernable cockpit or control point.   there were possibly grilled openings at the rear of the craft.   there were at least two centerline bays along the bottom of the craft.   we observed no windows, camera ports, antennas, external attachment points etc. we observed no numbers or other markings on the craft.\r\n\r\ndue to our relative positions, we could not observe the top aspect of the craft.   when viewed from the side, we were too far away to see any detail.\r\n\r\nthe craft was flat black, with the appearance of the “ironball” paint used on the sr-71.\r\nthe thought came to mind:   “lockheed skunkworks – kelly johnson”.\r\n\r\nobservers’ impression:   \r\nwe saw a us military stealth intruder craft being tested.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Louvres","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

as if from the north. the farther orb met with the second one and looked like they became one and they met with the third and they were all one. 2 seconds after that it went off just shot off and was gone. i said \"liz did you just see what i saw?\" she said yes. we were both kind of dumbfounded. what the heck was that. no one else was looking up so we are the only ones that noticed them. i know it wasn't any fireworks. no one was lighting any at the time. the orbs were farther up than any firework i have seen. there were no trails behind them. no kind of a heat wave around them. just solid red orbs. i was 26 27 at the time. i am now 55 and it seems like it was yesterday. we sat there and observed these for only maybe 45 seconds and were awe struck. i whole heartedly feel we saw ufos. never seen anything like it before. i've been watching the hangar 1 videos and there is a video with the electric and plasma universe or something like that. anyways the way magnet fields work it was sort of like that when they converge and became one. kind of eerie not knowing what was up there. i feel better i told someone who might truly understand this. i still keep an eye in the sky and more so because i live 1 mile away from south bend international airport. lots of low flying over me. i only wish i had video or at least a photo. awesome experience! sorry this appeared to take place out over lake michigan.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path

their reactions were really frustrating to me. very logical, no-nonsense people in their 50-60s.\r\ngrandpa was stern, german, and a lutheran minister, so maybe that explains their attitude.\r\n\r\nparents - 1970s back road waupaca county near clintonville, wi - mom described an orange, glowing cigar-shaped ship moved silently above high tension wires. saw people in windows of vehicle. mom was very nonchalant, very hard to get any details. puzzling...\r\n\r\naunt and uncle - same relative area as above, near a blueberry marsh, saucer-shaped object with red and green flashing lights on edge, was hovering over a field between the road and woods beyond. aunt scared, dog barking, uncle got out of car, while screaming at him to leave. uncle said it sounded like a number of piper cub engines. after hovering for a few minutes, it flashed a beam of light on the ground, then shut off, rose about fifty feet, and shot off over the trees. went back the next day and saw a slightly-singed circle in the dry, mown grass.\r\n\r\ntwo uncles - fishing predawn on shawano lake, shawano county, large lake at the eastern edge of the town of shawano, wi. they saw a formation of circular lights moving silently over the lake, from east to west. i seem to remember uncle saying there were about 7-8 of them. \r\n\r\nparents - eau claire, wi, east of twin cities, mn. babysitting for their niece and nephews, were heading to airport to pick up the parents about 10 pm. saw a large light hovering in sky over a suburban area of city, on a hillside. dad stopped the car, and folks got out to get a better look. some people in the houses near by came out to observe also. light simply drifted off, away from town. again, no sound.\r\n\r\nyou probably don't want to bother with skimpy info like this, but just wanted to tell someone about the events i heard about in my youth.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500
