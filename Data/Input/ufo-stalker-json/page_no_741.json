it was a unusual morning cause of the silence and nobody was around. anyway, i arrived at the park with my bb gun looking for owls. i know, that's what i did as a kid. so, i'm looking through the trees and see an object sitting on top of a very high tree. what's so weird is this object was sitting on middle top which no way could support the weight on anything that looks like that. so i take aim and thought about shooting it. but once i really looked at it, i couldn't figure out what it could be. so i waited for someone to show up. after about 20 minutes , i decided to go and find a witness, but as soon as i went around the first house, i thought it would not be there when i returned. so i came back. that's when i became afraid. the object was gone, didn't hear it leave, but now i here the insects and birds even the wind blowing again. of course no one ever believed me. but it's a true story, just wanted to share this with you guys for some possible feedback.

end rotated 90 degrees upward. basically the entire craft rotated 90 degrees without changing course or speed. very very large craft and definitely not man made. i grew up and lived near a military base for 33 years and know a lot about aircraft and their capabilities. not even an osprey or harrier could maneuver this way without changing speed. it looked like a skyscraper laying on its side

take a picture.When she came into the room i was able to stand up and go to the window with her. the windows were open and we could hear no sound but could feel a vibrating ohm through our body. the red neon lights i had seen were attached somehow it was blurry to a large cube van size super bright light.\r\nthe outside outline was blurry but it seemed that there was movement to the light within itself. there were many red beams 70-100 the were all different sizes up to 100 ft in length.The were at least 8 inches in diameter and had solid flat ends. the trees on the other side of street were red like the red from a heat lamp.This was close to power lines and three transformers on the pole that i could not see it was between us but closest to the pole the red lights retracted and the red glow faded and the immense brightness dimmed and it shrunk until it blinked twice and disappeared. it was very small when it blinked i remember seeing a silver type object that yellow blinked from.I do not know how long it was there or how long we actually saw it for it was 11 pm when all said and done. my daughter thinks they are following me, maybe cause i saw something as a child i have since moved as anxiety and having to be looking out the window all the time for its return.This pic is out the window and i can only give the size shape etc with drawing added  second pic is from internet its the closest i could find but still not quite the same as red lights i saw were solid and think with blunt flat ends and was much closer.My memory of event is very confusing cause i remember things that i do not recall happening...Like ignoring it and looking away doing something else but i was almost in a trance? i couldn't really move or think or speak until it was gone and we both thought

around the lake and it was just about dark when i saw two people standing at the edge of the water on the i-94 side of the lake. i rowed over to them thinking they were two other friends who always fished the lake. i rowed up to them, maybe 15 feet away and started calling their names, no reply. it was dark and i couldn't make them out except in silhouette. i was about to row closer when the kids in the back started screaming and crying. i turned to them and they pointed to my left and i saw this object floating maybe 2 feet off the water maybe 100 feet away.\r\n\r\n     the object was oval with a flattened bottom and maybe 10-20 feet wide. it's color was an opalescent white that did not reflect on the water. it didn't make a sound or disturb the surface of the water and seemed to slowing be coming toward us.\r\n\r\n     when i realized something was very wrong i turned the boat around and headed for the opposite shore where we kept the boat. we were all scared to death and ran for the kids house as soon as we hit shore. i did not bother to look at the object again, i was scared and rowing my heart out.\r\n\r\n     when we came into their house their mother and father started yelling at the three of us asking \" where the hell were you \". i replied i took the boys for a boat ride and tried to explain what happened. they father cut me off saying \"bullshit\" they had combed the area by the lake and walked around it calling for the boys for the last hour and found nothing. i told that couldn't be as it just turned dark 20 minutes ago and we didn't see you or hear you. he pointed at the clock and it was 11:15 pm, i thought it was maybe 10.\r\n\r\n     there is more to this but it's hard to explain here. this has bothered me since that day and simply had to

i first viewed the light at approximately 1000 ft agl,45 -60 degrees above the horizon, moderate brightness, slight flicker.  the light grew brighter and larger in size leading me to assume it was closing the distance on the helicopter as well as descending.  at its lowest altitude; i'd guess it neared 300-400 ft agl and approximately 0.50 miles away.  it looked like a landing light of an approaching aircraft.  the helicopter began to depart from the roof of the hospital and the light hovered in place and ceased its decent.  once the helicopter was clear of the hospital the light made a quick adjustment to a more southerly position and ascended back the same direction from which it originated.  i was able to follow the light during its ascent, but it quickly faded with distance.  i

it was my friend, her sister, little brother, and her mom and dad.  as they drove up my street we saw a shiny, silvery white fat cigar -shaped object coming from our left, coasting over the woods behind my house.  we stopped the car, turned off the engine, and all of us climbed out; watching the object move over the woods.  it didn't make a sound, moving pretty fast.  suddenly it stopped dead, hovering over one of the tallest trees;  i'd guess the tree was about 50 feet high.  it sat there, as if  watching us for maybe 4 minutes or so; giving us the opportunity to really look at it.  it had soft orange lights pulsing on either end of the cigar shape sphere.  there was a strip from end to end of windows, bluish white from within and we could just make out some faint shadowy figures; couldn't make out any features.  we were stunned, because we all saw and watched it.  being a teenager, i was more excited than scared.  it seemed to be looking at us too.  after those 4 minutes, as we watched, it shot straight up like lightening, disappearing into the night, still without any sound!  two evenings later, my friend and her sister and i were sitting outside their house on their back patio,  and there it was again, still coming from our left, a little higher up, and just as silent;  it passed over us and headed onto the right and disappeared.  we never saw it again. i guess we weren't the only ones to notice that ufo, because for several days after the sighting, the local airport about a half hour drive from where we lived was innundated with calls about the object.  i felt calm and full of wonder, having witnessed such a thing, and if i had any doubts about other life and beings existing in our incredible universe, they were completely laid to rest then and there!  since then its been fabulous learning about the universe we live in.  i'm not afraid;

purchased the animals to please me since we just moved from chicago. i awoke extra early. as i held the three chicks, a flash of silver in the sky, to my left, caught my eye. \r\n\r\nthen the light zigzagged to the right, then left and finally, to the right and paused just slightly above me. the top and bottom spun left but the center spun right. the center has shiny black windows. the aircraft tilted and zoomed in even closer. shocked i didn't move or breathed. i remember praying. at that moment i knew what i was looking at. the space ship hummed and the dark windows cleared. i saw people, not many. i felt like they spotted me all alone and came to see what i was doing.\r\n\r\n i remember having two conversations. one, i was praying and the second, i was explaining what i was doing and why i didn't like moving to miami.  i couldn't understand how i was having two conversations. the back of my mind unlocked with pictures. it's going to be okay, said a voice. then the windows smoked, the ship straightened, hummed louder and whoosh, zoomed right behind the trees and then left...Back where it came from leaving a trail of light. \r\n\r\nseveral  months later, in the early morning, my cousin took his mom to work. they lived with us. well, they saw a creature with no hair, big black eyes and no clothes with long dangling  arms just hovering above the street. they swirled to avoid hitting it. i think they hit a mailbox but the point is, it returned, this alien was seen a few houses down from mine. \r\n\r\nyears later, teaching the real estate law class, we were discussing paranormal encounters and disclosures when a student who lived in venezuela said he saw a space ship come up from the water late at night while he worked in a hotel. he described the same ship and windows and how it unsmoked and cleared. but he got a better view of them. i had the sun in my eyes. he said the day after an earthquake hit chile.\r\n\r\nthen, years later, while showing a house, i walked into the bedroom and wham, the walls and ceilings were covered in newspaper clippings of ufo's. the ceiling was space with orbiting planets. the aunt apologized. said her grandson is fixated ever since spotting them. but on the wall was a clipping with a sketch of an alien seen in miami during heavy fog and it matched the description of my aunt and cousin's encounter. i have not seen anymore ufo's since.....But, is it possible they can walk through walls?  \r\nthis is my story...\r\ni have no proof but i am positive it can be verified.\r\ni believe in them because i know what i saw, felt and heard.\r\nwe are in no way prepared for this. in my humble opinion, you cannot negotiate with a higher mind and a superior race.","distance":"101-500

who saw it. the classmates claimed seeing it 1 town over about 3hrs before our encounter.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

stadium app. half way up facing east. during the halftime home coming events on the field i witnessed a 2 foot diameter orb traveling horizontally from north to south over the field. the object was not like the 2 dimensional translucent orbs seen in most pictures after development. this object was a solid 3d sphere, not a light. its color was a bluish green. it was traveling between 80 and 100 mph. the entire sighting lasted a little over 2 seconds. it traveled over the eastern hatch marks on the field and was slightly lower than the field lights. nearly ever person was focused on the homecoming court down on the field. upon seeing the orb i immediately notified my friends. two of the three were able to see the orb before it rapidly faded out of site. the object had very sharp defining edges no blurs or fuzziness, the inside seemed to be made of plasma, it was not extremely bright and flew in a perfectly strait and flat trajectory. the most interesting part of the story came later.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
