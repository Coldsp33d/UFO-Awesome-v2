8\" wide from our perspective. i would guess that would equal nearly 75'-100' in diameter. \r\nit was disc shaped a dull grey metallic color with concave outer edges which sloped inward making it wider on the bottom than on the top. on the top deck there was a smaller dome like object in the center. the outer edges of the craft had port holes like structures that pulsed with yellow/ white lights that flashed sequentially around the craft. the dome on the top had smaller lights and there was a much smaller dome beneath the craft with lights. \r\n\r\nit seemed like several minutes that we observed the craft, but in reality it was more like 5-10 seconds. without a sound it rose higher to about 100'off the ground shifting position several hundred feet now facing east. as it continued to rise the front of the craft tipped to a 45 degree angle and what looked like a lightening bolt of bright light ranging from pure white to yellow to almost orange the craft vanished. the entire process of departure took maybe 2 seconds. \r\n\r\nwe looked at one another with amazement and fear. we ran home (100 yards)and told our parents. naturally they laughed at the prospects that we saw a ufo. we were insistent that we saw something we had never seen before. we knew it was a ufo. i remember my father reading the news paper the following day, and in the paper there was a report of a police officer further away wrote that he saw something that evening. i believe he took a photograph (which was in the paper) as it departed which showed up as a negative because it was so bright. our parents retracted what they said to us the night before since a police officer saw it too.  \r\n\r\nthis part of the beach is used by many people at all times of the day. there were over a dozen people walking that area at the same time we witnessed the object. it would be highly unlikely that they did not see the craft since most were closer to it than we were. i believe some were within yards of it.\r\n\r\nafter that encounter we(many people)sitting on the beach at night would see small red balls of light streaking across the surface of the ocean almost nightly. it became the thing to do at night. go to the beach and watch the red balls. the orbs would cover incredible distances (about 10 miles) in mere seconds. they would then join up to form a single larger sphere and rise into the night sky and become a bright star.\r\n indistinguishable from the millions of others. this occurred many times for many years. one night we(5-10 people) sitting on the beach having a bonfire witnessed a very large brilliant object rising behind eagle island about 2 miles off shore. it was about 9ish and getting dark. one of the adults said it was the planet venus. i was about 14-15 at the time and knew better that it wasn't venus. as it rose above the island it became obvious that it was larger than the island was long about 1/4 mile. it too rose slowly into the night sky and within a few minutes looked like another star, yet it moved with incredible speed and made several sharp angular turns. we never saw the lights again after that.\r\n\r\ni do not have a any drawing of the craft, but as a trained artist i could easily do one.

speedway.  i was at my grandpa's house walking across the driveway to my uncle's house. before going inside we stopped to talk and as we were standing outside we noticed the tree in front of us moving as though the wind were blowing, but there was no wind, just a hot, calm night. the shaking of the leaves made us look up and we noticed that directly above us we could not see any stars and we could hear a sound like the wind but no other trees were moving and there was no breeze. we thought it was weird at first but continued to talk for a moment, we looked back up a few moments later and saw what looked like the back end of a ship from a star wars movie but the craft itself seemed to be cloaked in darkness. we saw what looked like a propulsion system or thrusters of some kind on the rear of the craft and as the craft slowly moved over us we could only make out the shape of the back end of it, it resembled an elongated hexagon. then suddenly from the front of the craft a beam of some kind that looked like blue/white lightening or electricity shot out of it, toward the horizon and the beam seemed to open and form some kind of square shaped opening or portal in the sky. when the beam shot out it illuminated the front end of the craft and i could tell it was pointed and about 60 to 70 feet long and about 20 feet wide. i could see purple and pink gas clouds in the opening, it was like looking through a window into a different place. the craft began to make a sound like it was building up energy and then went into the opening so fast it was nothing more than a streak of light , like warp speed. then the opening closed, i don't know how else to describe it other than it looked like an old tv turning off, and it was gone. the entire encounter from beginning to end was about 6 minutes. my cousin and i looked at each other and without saying anything we ran in to my uncle's house and tried to tell our family what we had seen, but they didn't know what to think. they tried to explain it away as an overactive imagination and to many si-fi movies, but after years of contemplating the encounter i know what i saw that night was real and that the story needed to be shared with someone who would believe it really happened and take it seriously. my uncle who was the most skeptical of our encounter at the time has now, years later, recanted his opinion and now admits that he has since seen something similar and now believes our story. since that day i have been a believer and i teach my children that we are not alone in the universe.","distance":"21-100

away it really was, but i would say each side of the craft was at least 90 feet long.  it was a perfct triangle.  the shape can only be compaired to the triangle thing you set the balls with when playing pool.  i did have my video camera on and filming an empty sky for about an hour.  like i said i did not see it again so i did not catch any visual evidence.  however, my video camera was making a wierd noise that i have never heard it do before or sence.  it was a high frequency electronic sound, hard to explain.  when i reviewed the film a few days later i realized that the recording had clicks or taps in the audio in the same spot of the film that i heard the high pitched noise when i was filming.  i thought maybe it is morrase code or something so i downloading free morrase code decoding software and looped back the audio of the film through the software.  when the tapping started on the recording the software picked up letters.  when the recording was over i ended up with about a paragraph worth of radom letters that i could not make any sense of.","distance":"101-500

her to get to her mom's in arizona... i couldn't tell you how long we were their before my uncle came over and asked to take me out to explore...And after begging mom to let me go i was finally told , ok/\r\n so we planed on leaving at first light the next day. it turned out to be several hours before day light.\r\n   so about 0330 or so my uncle woke me up... i quietly got up and dressed then we wrote a note to mom and grandma so they wouldn't worry. then quietly slipped out of the house. we drove for hours and well into the day before we got to the devil's spire... or the porch step to heaven...We got out and uncle put some ropes around me and himself and we started to climb. we had been climbing for a long while when i heard him say,\" stop and hold on to the rocks and be still. the next thing i knew he had grabbed me and slung me around his shoulder and onto his back and tied me on. then he continued the climb... it wasn't too long before we were on top of the plat-toe....We rested in the shade next to a big rock...Uncle gave me a drink and some food and had me rest while he went back down for the rest of our supply's for the night. \r\n   it was later in the evening when i looked up at my uncle only to find a horrified look on his face....When i turned to look is when the beam of light came out. it was just hovering out in front of us. but next to the plat-toe away from the wall by 50 feet anyway...It hummed and had a swirlish kind of sound....As i looked i could see a window and 2 people looking at us. the next thing i know is that my uncle had grabbed me and jerked me up on to his back and ran for the rope that we had used to climb up with. we drove so fast with uncle looking over his shoulder in fear...It was later when we pulled in to grandmas did we find out that we were gone for some 3 and half days. \r\n   that just wasn't possible. i was nine or just ten at the time. so you can imagine the trouble i got into because of being gone for so long. what was strange was that grandma called the marshall and he came out to ask question's. he left scratching his head in disbelief and anger. apparently we were gone for some 3.5 days and the cops had been searching for us. i found out some years latter that we out on the hoppy indian reservation . in a place that was called wonderland. it was about 18 months latter my uncle would die from a very different kind of fast moving cancer. i myself have had medical issues since. \r\n   i wish i had proof but i have none. i wish i never would have experienced this but i did. and now i'm the only one

located on hwy,64  west about 1 mile from our home, to buy some snacks to watch a movie on tv . on the way ther, with the windows rolled down, i noticed that it was un usally quiet with  little to no traffic in sight . i truned  into the parking lot and parked the car and stepped out to go into the store. when i went in i noticed there was no one except the store clerk and myself. she was on the phone talking to someone so i decided, to go out side and wait . as i stepped out side i looked around, at which time i looked up and noticed a huge object with rotating multi-colored lights that appeared to be as large as a football field . the elevation of the object seemed to be between 100 to 500 feet up .The lights flashed sequentially.I stood there looking at it in amazement realizing i was looking at a ufo. the object, i felt,was observing me i stood there motionless and calm for a minute or two . i turn and went back inside to tell the clerk to step out side with me to see if she could see what i was seeing in the sky . she said yes i will .We walked out together and i tould her to look in the same direction that i was looking . i ask her do you see that object ? .She said yes i do ,she paused for a brief moment at which she turn and went back in.At which time i took my eyes off the object for a second and looked up again ,and it had vanished with out a trace. i walked back in the store and purchased the snacks i came for and left to go back home. when i arrived home i got out of the car ,went in, at which time i tould my husband what i had seen. his comment was \"you did ? he looked at me puzzled like he didn't belive me. a couple of nights later ,             around 10:30pm we were getting ready to go to bed. the lights were off , at which time , i decided to look out the bedroom window which was facing north and saw at a  distance  the same object  i had seen two nights  before. i tould  my husband to come and look , he did . by the time he came to see the object, it had disappeared from sight. about three weeks later  , we watched on tv a documentary on ufo\"s on the program it showed different shapes of ufo\"s . while watching the program i was

road. as i went around the bend of the road noticed a glimmer of light out of the right side of my windshield in the sky which at first i thought was a reflection of a plane. when my eyes focused on the object which i believe was 500 to 1000 feet away i realized it was not a plane. it was cylindrical in shape so i stopped to see what it was. when i got out of the car it appeared to be stationary. the object looked to be 30-100 feet long. two dark stripes evenly spaced on the object and it had what looked to be be 4-5 black circles in the middle of the craft which i guess could be considered windows. i wiewed the object in disbelief for around 2 minutes. it eventually started to move due east at a constant speed and i lost sight of it in the trees.I did see a helicopter heading in the oposite direction a half mile down the road as i left wondering if they had seen the same thing. i was in total disbelief and could not believe no one else noticed it. while i was stopped 2-3 cars passed by behind me but i could not take my eyes off of this thing. it was so strange. i figured when i got out of the car that i would eventually see wings or something on it but it was just hanging there in the sky like an extended shiny can of beans with no label. that is the best way i can describe it. my heart is still racing after some time not seeing wings on this thing.The object looked to be metallic in nature and emitted no sound.I will never forget this day.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering
