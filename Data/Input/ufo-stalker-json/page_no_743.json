we turned right and pulled over to see what was going on and that's when i started filming. i automatically thought that they were ufo's because they started off at somewhere around 15 or 20 lights

knew that we weren't alone i was just shocked because i never thought that i would see an unknown object. after it seems like the objects disappeared a helicopter came immediately afterward and began

attending eastern new mexico university located in the city of portales, new mexico. we were at a fraternity party being held in a farm building located on a deserted county road about 8 miles from the city in the middle of flat farmland with no lights or houses within miles.  there were about 40 people at the party, loud music and lots of noise.\r\n   after we had been there for about two hours my girl friend and i went outside to my car, which was parked outside close to the building, to get some fresh air. we were looking up to the sky which was perfectly clear, lots of stars, no haze or clouds from horizon to horizon. i was looking in a southerly direction where i noticed a very large dark oval shaped object blocking the starlighted night sky.  my first thought thought was that it was a cloud.  we continued to look at the sky for quite some time (20 or 30 minutes) and saw that the object had not moved from its original location. i told my girl friend that this was strange since clouds move across the sky and change shape. i looked all the way around to see if there were any clouds or any aircraft in the sky and there were none.  i began to look closely at the object.  we were looking up at the object at a 45 degree angle. it was very large at least 500 to 600 feet across.  it was stationary at a height of 2000 or 3000 feet, 4 or 5 miles away in a southerly direction from us.  we continued observing the object which remained stationary, with no lights or sounds. the object had a definite oval shape. the object did not have a clearly defined sharp edge, rather, it had a fuzzy edge that blended into the night sky. after observing the object for a while longer, i noticed three or four small round shaped objects slowly fly out and away a distance from the large object.  after a while, the small objects would fly back into the large object, and others would fly out and back into the oval object.  the small objects also blocked out the starlighted sky and had fuzzy edges that blended into the night sky.  we observed the objects for about an hour until we we decided to rejoin the party.  about 2 hours later, the party was over.  when we left and the objects were no longer visible.\r\n   we never told or reported the incident to anyone for fear of being rediculed.  \r\n     \r\n     \r\n    \r\n","distance":"Over One

been and that is when i knew it was a probe, because, from the angle where i was standing in the den to where i saw the light, there was no way it could have been from the other street,because we had a patio roof that extended 15 feet from right above the sliding glass door and at that angle (45 degrees) i would have been looking right at the patio roof 2 feet away. there was no way at all it was

west/southwest. once these objects were overhead for some reason, i felt really afraid. and being a former combat medic, i don't scare easily.  how did i feel, well initially i felt basically, oh that's a really bright star. but once i was looking directly at the bottom of the things, i was a little confused. because of a few things. one i had no memory of getting out of my car, and really had no reason to do so. as i was there to pick someone up from work. and two, i suddenly noticed a woman also standing there with me looking up at the thing. yet i didn't see her walk up to my car, didn't see her get out of her car or well don't remember seeing her doing so, and she expressed confusion to me, as to how she'd even gotten there. as she said she had no memory of driving there, getting out of her car, or walking over and up to mine. it was lit, just one second i was alone, and the next i wasn't. i've always been a skeptic when it came to the issues of u.F.O.'s but after seeing this,

bling, bling, bling.  then out, all at once.  this happened a third time, again moving forward a few yards, then a fourth.  this time, instead of all going out at one time, all the lights began to spin to the left, giving the sense that they were attached to a very large circular/disc shaped object (as the sky was getting dark, it was hard to see much beyond the lights themselves).  spinning, the lights became a blur.  then they streaked off to the north and vanished within a few hundred yards.  i have poor depth perception, but i would say this object was fairly low to the water for a flying craft -- maybe equal to the height of a 3 to 5-story building.  the lights were round, glowing bright orange, and had to be several feet across to be as visible as they were from the ground.  the overall object was not really visible in the dark.  as i said, i did feel the lights were attached to something dark and round, as the eventual spinning before shooting off created a blurred path, with the lights disappearing as they spun to the far side of the craft, then appearing again as they came around to the front.\r\n\r\nthe ferry was packed with all the passengers standing along the rails or near their cars.  i remember feeling frozen -- had my camera around my neck, but was so in awe of the sight, that i couldn't look away to take a picture.  the entire group just stared silently, accept a man standing in front of me.  he said, \"are we seeing what i think we're seeing?\"  i responded with, \"i can't think of any other explanation.\"  he and i exchanged some \"holy cows\", but no one else made a sound or even looked away.  i made a few comments to my friend, but she never responded.  on the car ride back up the island to avon (where we were staying) i couldn't stop talking about it to the friend that was with me.  she never really said much -- i assumed that she was still in shock.  but, years later, i brought this event up to her.  her response shocked me.  she told me that she remembers me mentioning the event from time to time, but she doesn't remember being there.  she insists it must have happened another time.  well, i've only been to the outer banks once - there was no other time.  i know it was not a dream and have to believe that she has just blocked it out.  as so many on the ferry remained silent and motionless, i've often wondered if the man i talked to and myself were among a very few that were aware of what we were seeing.  \r\n\r\nnote: under \"number of objects observed\", i checked both 1 and 3.  i definitely saw 3 round lights, and only speculate that they were attached to 1 large craft.  number of witness is estimated.\r\ni am reporting this now, as this sighting just keeps getting stronger in my mind.  i am curious to know if any others on that ferry reported this event.

east villiage neighborhood. where evergreen street meets the freeway, before rounding up, becoming ada steet, and across evergreen from the iconic st. stanislaus church, west side of the freeway and the morton's salt plant.\r\n\r\na bit of back story:\r\n\r\nbefore i begin, i must point out that i've seen planes, helicopters, birds, balloons, and satellites before, and this object wasn't any of those things. i saw this thing four years ago, but still remember it vividly.\r\n\r\ni was home alone in my apartment, neither of my roommates at the time were home.\r\n\r\ni went out to have a cigarette around 9:05 pm. i had just returned, the day before, from my parent's home in north central indiana. the stars are obviously much more visible at my folk's home without all the light pollution from the chicago metropolitan area. i spotted many satellites when i was at my parent's house and wondered if i could see any in her city since only a handful of stars can cut through the light pollution. sure enough, after prolonged sky gazing, i spotted a satellite moving across the sky.\r\n\r\nthe sighting:\r\n\r\nas i was staring at the sky (facing east) eventually i noticed an object moving from east to west. i was able to watch the object for at least two minutes before buildings blocked my view.\r\n\r\nthe first thing i noticed was its slow and deliberate movement. the trajectory of the object would eventually take it almost directly overhead as it continued to move west in a deliberate straight line. the object was very high in the sky, but i can't even begin to guess its actual altitude.\r\n\r\nthe object was pale white, so pale that one would not notice it at a glance. i watched it as it continued moving west.\r\n\r\nas the object moved closer to being overhead, more features emerged. first i noticed a very faint blue illuminous halo surrounding the object. very faint, again the object would not be noticeable on a glance. then i noticed the the objects pale white core was - it's hard to describe - squiggly in motion. this squiggly motion was a trait of the object's core and not a trait of its flight trajectory, which as i've stated before, was a straight line moving east to west.\r\n\r\nnext i noticed very faint blue illuminous beams periodically emitting from the object's underside, more on that soon.\r\n\r\nthe next feature i noticed were particles dropping from the object's underside, independent of the faint blue beams. these particles were the same illuminous faint blue color as the halo and beams. the particles descended and disappeared very quickly, like the last trails of fireworks descending before quickly disappearing, but did not leave a \"smoke trail\" like fireworks.\r\n\r\nas this was happening the object was practically directly overhead and it was still emitting the beams.  one of the beams crossed my eye and actually created a glare in my eye, like a traditional light beam - like from a flashlight. only it was, of course, much dimmer.\r\n\r\nto my right i noticed flickering, as if the light beam struck the earth not 20 feet away from me. i got very anxious and actually crouched down, pressing my back against the closed door of my apartment.\r\n\r\nthe object kept moving west. it crossed over the top of my apartment building. i ran up to the street (evergreen) and watched it continue west for a few moments. it was completely silent.\r\n\r\ni wish i had binoculars so i could get a clear and close view of the object, but alas i did not.\r\n\r\nmy roommates weren't home to witness this strange object and i googled searched for weeks after hoping to find other sightings from that night to corroborate mine, but i didn't find anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over

at night i had just passed plummer idaho heading south on highway 95 when off to my right i noticed a long cigar shaped object hovering in the air it had three blue lights at each end.  i slowed down and was about to pull over to get a better look at what i was seeing when it appears to move toward me.  i speed up and the object then speeds up as well i slow down. it does the same.  always remaining parallel with me.  i then accelerated to about 125mph it was still there then a few seconds later it accelerated away from me on a westward heading at very high speed.  i then slowed back to speed limit.  the unsettling part of this encounter is that it's about 1 1/2 hour drive from spokane washington to my house in moscow idaho.  i left spokane at 7 pm and clearly do not remember stopping at any point on the highway but it was 1:30 am when i got home.  so there is a approximately 4 hour gap of time i cannot account for.","distance":"101-500

event in june of 1988 that started out with me waking up around 1am to go into my kitchen and stare out the window at a certain spot in the sky, i would see a light but i was unsure if it was a star or something else.\r\ni knew what i was doing there at the window but would not consciencely admit it to myself( its difficult to explain)almost as tho i knew what was coming and what i was looking for.\r\nthis 2 week event is too long and too involved to type the whole thing out here,but it involved abduction, my physically seeing the ship, physically seeing 2 entities in my apartment twice and also a hooded figure that appeared at the foot of my bed and did something to the bottom of my foot that was very painful.\r\nduring this 2 week time i contacted yvonne smith, she and also bud hopkins worked with me to help me thru this 2 week period. i also called yvonne in panic the 2nd time the entities were in my apartment.\r\nalso the morning after the abduction i woke up with a bruise the size of a huge dinner plate on my stomach.( dont know if this makes sense but after the abduction i was returned to my bed and i immediately knew something had happened to me.) its just too hard to explain the details here.\r\nbegan having dreams about what was done to me during the abduction and also about the things they showed me.\r\nbud hopkins wanted to make this more public, get it out there but i refused, i was too afraid and ive been too afraid all these years to talk about those 2 weeks, im almost 60 years old now and i want to finally make what happened to me known, its time.\r\nalso i believe there was a  connection to rocketdyne which was just a few blocks away from my apt. if i can talk with someone i can tell them why i think that.\r\nyvonne wanted to use hypnosis on me to get more details but i was too afraid to know more( i think i was afraid they would come back.)\r\nplease, i just want to get this story out, maybe telling it will help me in some way and possibly help someone else. ive lived with this a long, long time and it changed how i see the world and my life, it changed me as a person.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

taft prison in california in 1990. one morning, as i was driving westbound to work on hwy 119, i noticed a bright light that seemed out of place hovering over the horizon. i didn't think much about it until something strange happened. a circle formed around the light (ufo) and, within the circle, the sky lit up like it was day time, but this was about 30-45 minutes before sunrise. the entire sky was dark except for this ufo and the small circle that formed around it. i pulled off to the side of the road to get out of my car and take a closer look; i noticed 5-6 other drivers doing the same. after 5-10 minutes, the ufo slowly descended to the bottom of the circle (force field) that surrounded it. the ufo didn't just pass through the bottom of this force field, it looked as if it pierced the circle (force field) actually pulling it down into a point before it seemingly \"broke through\" and flew off southbound towards los angeles. once the sun finally came up, as i arrived to work, i noticed strange squiggly lines in the sky. i checked the newspaper and watched the evening news over the next few days to see if there were any explanations for this strange encounter, but i found none. i've never seen anything like it before or since.
