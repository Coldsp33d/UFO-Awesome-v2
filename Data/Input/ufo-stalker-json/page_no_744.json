stargazing when one of us pointed out a star that seemed brighter than others. easily as bright as jupiter. i suggested that it was probably jupiter when it seemed to double in size. within three seconds, it grew to double in size and brightness, then it split into 3 smaller points. these points originated in the center and radiated out. as they did, they trailed light behind. the center went out. the three points of light remained steady, at a distance of approximately two fingers apart, for about thirty seconds. then they blinked out, one by one. no star i had ever seen had ever done anything like that. we all looked at each other, and somebody asked what we should do. fearing ridicule and career alteration, we agreed to not say anything. it was almost 30 years ago, and i remember it like it was last night.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

from my right side at 66 degrees from the horizon (east)and move at good speed to the north by northwest. the object was bright white, brighter than the background stars and was made no noise as it passed in front of me in less than 15 seconds. there were no clouds to my right from which is the direction the object came from. this object then passed above the clouds which were around 15,000ft-20,000ft (used the sandia mountains a reference for altitude) to the northwest my (left) and still reaming bright till i could no longer view it when it passed over more cloud cover to the northwest. it's altitude i would say was 22,000ft to 28,000ft and traveling faster than previous objects i have seen. there were no navigational lights or flashing lights on this object and the speed was faster than a passenger plane a cruising speed. at the time of the incident i did try to record this but the cameras from my phone and sport camera couldn't pick anything. this is do to poor night viewing quality of the cameras, not from the object. there were no other aircraft in the area and no other witnesses at the time of the sighting to my knowledge. my cat was unaffected by the sighting. what surprised me about this sighting is the speed at which the object traveled. other objects i had seen moved slowly across the sky this object cleared the same areas as the others in less than 15 seconds as compared to up to 2 minutes from other sightings. hoping to get a better camera with better night quality viewing to capture these on tape. i trying to contact please leave a message as i might not be there to answer any inquiries but will return calls. best time to call 1600hrs-2200hrs. thank you","distance":"Over One

being visible and then invisible depending on a light flashing on it. \r\n\r\nthis occurred about 14 years ago (although i've seen others in more recent years including \r\na couple of years (2013) ago and also about 4 years ago)  \r\n\r\ni was driving north over the golden gate bridge and as i was nearing the north end of\r\nthe bridge i could see an object against the rocky hill close to the waldo grade tunnel.\r\nas you come off the road and onto pavement, there was a middle section where \r\ntow trucks and other emergency vehicles can park.  traffic moves on both sides\r\nto this lane.  the tow truck had it's propeller turning and the propeller had red\r\nlights.  the ufo only appeared when the red light shinned on it.  \r\nwhen the light was off of it, the ufo was invisible!   as the propeller\r\nturned and the red light shinned on it, i could see the ufs for a few seconds\r\nat a time.  since i was traveling toward it, i had a very limited time to see it.\r\nit was disc shaped and had at least 3 levels and each level was smaller than\r\nthe previous one.  there is a similar illustration on shutterstock.  it's image id is\r\n70711765. however this image is still not accurate.  i did question if what i was\r\nseeing was real and if i was really looking at rocks in a ufo shape against the\r\nhill.  i've looked at this hill many time and i've never seen any rock formation\r\nthat could look like what i saw.  \r\n\r\ni am documenting this sighting over all others because you can\r\nuse a red light to view an otherwise invisible ufo.  at least i was \r\nable to.  it's worth investigating and installing on us aircraft that might be\r\ncalled to investigate a live sighting.  \r\n\r\nlocations where i've seen other ufos include: napa, novato (over area called\r\n\"black point\" which is all flat land, larkspur near the larkspur landing \r\nferry terminal, lagunitas in the country, etc.  i've seen all different shapes\r\nand lights. when i was a child i questioned if i was being spied on by ufos\r\nbecause i would wake up in terror inside my bedroom and felt like something\r\nwas inside.  this was during a time when i was seeing ufos in the sky. this\r\nwas many years ago where there were only a few wineries in napa.  there\r\nwere many orchards around with fruit trees until the technology was available\r\nto put vineyards on hills.  all of my sightings were in no california.   i reported\r\nmany to the police but not all of them.  many sightings were when we didn't\r\nhave cell phones.  \r\n\r\n\r\n

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Nighttime i was standing on a small second floor balcony overlooking the alley talking to a friend's sister. it was her apartment. something, possibly a very low frequency hum, caused us to pause and look up in a slight northerly direction. the balcony was on the east end of the building which was a 2 story structure. i saw clearly from street and city lights a very large triangular flying craft moving very slowly toward us. it went overhead traveling south and disappeared over the tree tops. it made no sound that was noticeable unless it was very low decibel level. it was a quiet night and i do not recall any traffic which would come in waves when it did as denver had street lights that were synced so traveling at speed limit one would hit all green lights. time of night was a factor in the quiet. the craft had no lights, no visible windows, no markings and seemed close enough one could hit it with a thrown rock. after it disappeared from view the woman and i just looked at each other with stunned surprise and unspoken \"did you see that?\" eyes.  we went inside and told the other 2 inside what had happened. they seemed only a little interested. i was sober but may have smoked marijuana at some point prior as was our habit to do. the marijuana was not powerful in those days unless one spent extra money for more potent product which would be rare for us considering our financial situations. we rarely drank alcohol or imbibed in any other mind altering substances for that matter. the whole incident was about 15 to 20 seconds in length. probably was close to 11 pm.\r\nit was quite remarkable to me immediately that what i was seeing was flying so slow and was quite large and virtually silent. no engine sounds and no air friction sounds and i would estimate it traveled at about 20 mph. i looked for any marks such as numbers, letters, doors windows or lights and it had none of these on the underside and had no visible sides. it appeared to be fairly flat from my angle of view. it was predominately (90%) dark or drab green and the triangle tips were rounded not pointed and were a dark drab burgundy color. it was low enough to be illuminated by mercury vapor street lights. i never at any time thought it to be anything of human or earthly origin as flight must have a sound and aircraft must have lights. also it was flying too low within a mile of downtown denver. never heard any reported sightings of it by others. any mention to this day is of little interest to anyone. i do not have much interest in alien/ufo stuff or sci/fi. i am more reality based person and find \"mystical\" beliefs to be mostly nonsense. i never believed roswell was a ufo crash site or that aliens were found. i do not believe mind-reading or psychic abilities exist. most mysterious occurrences have explanations. i believe it is possible other beings exist somewhere but why they want to come here i find to be odd considering how much it would take to travel that far. humans would have to be to them what ants are to us. the scale of size of human existence though is oddly similar as per reported alien sightings but abilities seem to be quite dis-similar. memory plays tricks and eye to brain communication is not as exact as most think. a magician can astound people although they know full well that there is no magic involved. i personally knew a magician name of steve aldrich. amazing magician with jaw dropping tricks but not real magic. i can make a coin \"disappear\" in a bandana...\r\ni do not know if it is related or not but it was in this time period that i started experiencing debilitating anxiety attacks and still do to this day. the woman, i was learn years later, had been institutionalized with schizophrenia at some point. she was not helped by medications and had very little lucid thought and acted childlike. i had known her to be responsible, independent and sometimes pleasant but quick to anger which could be off-putting. i had no interest in her other than she was a friend's sister and she had let us stay from time to time at the apartment if we needed. the friend and i were typical long-haired guys with acoustic guitars, not uncommon in those days and that area (\"capital hill\") she was employed as a maid in a large denver hotel (the raddison i believe) i worked for a macrame/weaving supply business called strings and things. i was supervisor of the jute and wool dyeing department which was small and only had 3 or 4 part-time employees.\r\nit was a remarkable event that somehow nothing could be done or said and was rarely if ever recalled by me until i became a member of the computer amd internet age. i did some research on the 'net and saw a number of similar episodes but they all seemed to be later in time and the triangle was the only common theme. others all had lights and sound plus were far off sightings.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

just before my mother died. i felt that i had to ask her to be sure that this happened. her description was exactly what i remember. i told my brother after speaking with my mother and it all got

eastern high school from our elementary school (jane hite) to give her brother a message. \r\n\r\nthere was a wooded area between the two schools and a field.  i remember us walking into the wooded area and the next thing i remember is walking in the open field with her a few feet behind.  she all of a sudden started screaming and when i turned around to see what happened she was pointing up.  i looked up and there it was this huge cigar shaped object with windows running its length. it made no sound.  it was gray and the windows were dark. i was unable to see anything inside. i turned to her to say stop screaming and when i looked back up it was miles away and i could only see the back of it and then it disappeared.\r\n\r\nwe ran home as fast as we could. she to her home and me to mine. when i got in the house my mother could see that i was very upset and i told her what happened. \r\n\r\ni do not recall if it was the same day or the next that a man showed up at our home in a military uniform (air force) and identified himself to my mother and said he was with operation blue book.  (i recall my friend telling me her father was in the military.) i'm not sure what all there conversation was about but, she told me to go with him as they had some questions for me and my friend.\r\n\r\nas i walked to his car my friend was already in the back seat. after we were in the car he gave us the rules. we were not allowed to talk to each other and in a little while he would ask us to close our eyes and put our heads down and not open them until he said so.  if we didn't think we could do this he said he had blind folds for us to wear.  we told him we did not need the blind folds.\r\n\r\nperhaps it was 30 minutes later when he told us to close our eyes and put our heads down. with in 10 minutes or so he stopped and spoke to someone and continued on for a few more minutes. i believe we had stopped at some sort of gate and were let in. he then came to a complete stop and instructed us to get out of the car where we entered a single door and another man in uniform was waiting. he took my friend and we were separated at this point.\r\n\r\ni was taken into a small room and he got me a soda. he then started to ask me questions about what happened and what i saw. he asked me if i knew what a blimp was and i said yes i had seen one at the texas state fair. he was taking notes and i believe there was a tape recorder as he asked me to speak up a couple of times. he then pulled out some paper and asked me to draw what i saw. i did.  he then took my drawing and left the room for several minutes.\r\n\r\nwhen he returned he had a picture album and asked me if any of the pictures looked like what i saw.  there it was the exact same object we had encountered. a few minutes later my friend an i were taken back to the car with all the same rules in place. no talking, eyes closed and heads down. after a few minutes we were allowed to look out the windows of the car and i was taken home first.\r\n\r\nupon arriving home he walked me to the door and spoke to my mother. he asked if he could speak to her alone and i pretended to go to my room. my mother asked him what happened and his reply was that we identified the same object and they believe we were telling the truth.  he then cautioned her that we should probably not share what happened with anyone. people might think i was lying or crazy.  my mother's response (we both know it truly happened!)\r\n\r\ni never saw my friend again. i always assumed she moved.\r\n","distance":"101-500

we cleared the tree line we observed a large circular craft with orange and yellow lights around the bottom of the craft hovering about 50 feet above the home of our local sheriff. his home sat at the intersection of the road we were travelling on and catfish drive. we accelerated to the crossroad and stopped on the street in front of his home when four friends driving toward us (south) on catfish drive stopped along side of us. the craft immediately flew straight up and to the west at an amazing rate of speed and suddenly disappeared from view. we heard no sounds from the craft but the individual lights that circled the under carriage of the craft, appeared to pulse in a rotation pattern and were visible for about two seconds during the craft's assent. we were literally within 50-100 feet from the craft. \r\n\r\nwe all (6 of us)discussed it and decided not to report it for fear that no one would believe us. recently, i confirmed my recollection of the events surrounding that experience with the friend i was in the car with some 30+ years ago, and his memory of the event was the same. i thought it was time to finally file a report. i didn't do this before because i was a military member for 30 years. i am now retired. the person i was riding with was mike owens. the person driving the second car was michael fry.\r\n\r\nwhat has always been in the back of my mind is that our sheriff had a picture-perfect family and home. he had three sons, all who had bright futures. closely following the event we witnessed, his oldest son quit college, became an alcoholic and eventually committed suicide by crashing his car. i often wondered through the years if this event was related and if by speaking up we might have made a difference. the middle son also passed away but the youngest son has thrived in life.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

area, to gadsden ,al. after about hour and a half i noticed a white almost too white object, noticed dark of the branches in front of it, then as fast as you can blink, it was right by me, it seemed as i could almost touch it, then my dad said ,there's another 1! i looked out his side of car and there it was, only traveling at around maybe a couple hundred feet or maybe more it was hard to tell. then i looked at mine as his was traveling in the direction of the 1 on my side...As the 1 moving toward the 1 on my side, it stopped it seemed like right above it, then the 1 on my side stayed for a few more seconds, then slowly moved upward toward the other 1, at that time they just sat there, for a few seconds, and all the sudden, faster than can be imagined, they took off straight up, and i watched the best i could and i noticed them as a pinpoint at this time, and they seemed to be entering space...Then my dad looked at me and said, \" if you ever repeat this, i will swear you are lying, i laughed, he said no son, i ain't kidding, i'll tell them you are lying, never tell a soul. he is dead now, and i have wrestled with telling this ever since...Now i have, i feel better, whether you all believe it or not...I know what i saw. and it was not my personal first time, that happened when i was about primary school age, it was a small orb orange, with a blue like flame or something all round it. it entered the house ,i was paralyzed, and just watched as it sat in mid air right by me at maybe 3 ft. then it shot off at an ungodly speed allthru the house, and out the back, after that i had dreams about it for years off and on, then, me and my dad had our experience. i have not had the dream ever since. maybe they did not enjoy me, but i'd give anything to see another 1.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional

overcast overhead. i was outside walking around just enjoying the night. sunset had occurred an hour or so earlier and happened to look up at the sky. that's when i noticed a weird small blue light off in the distance, at about a 45 degree elevation from the horizon. as i stood there and looked at it, i noticed that it just didn't look right and the longer i watched it, the weirder and bigger it got. i couldn't believe my eyes and started getting a little scared. so i figured i had better go and get some of the other guys to come outside to look at this thing, because i wanted verification that i was actually seeing this and that i wasn't crazy! so i did just that. after a few people came outside and looked up and saw what i was pointing at, several of them ran inside to tell other people to come out.The longer we stood there, the bigger it got until it was about the size of a quarter, if you held it at between two fingers at arms length. then it just disappeared. this whole thing took about 45 minutes or so. it scared everybody there., some ran back inside and the rest of us stood there in misbelief and could not figure out what it was, that just happened. i have never been that scared in my life. i actually thought it was the end.
