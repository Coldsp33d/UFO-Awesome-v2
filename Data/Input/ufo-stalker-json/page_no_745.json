(back note : both my dad and grandfather were air force veterans. we were familiar with both airplanes and helicopters). we stopped playing to watch the light. it was very bright, moving just above treetop level. i thought to myself that it must be a huge helicopter, until it came to a halt right above a neighbor's barn. that's when we kids began exclaiming over it, because a helicopter would've been audible at that distance. we all walked to the road, out of the trees to get a better look. this put us within 200 feet of the craft. i could see an oval, metallic shape, with a bright light at the bottom central area. a beam shot down, illuminating the barn and yard. the neighbor girl was very upset - it was hovering over her yard and barn. i asked out loud \" what is that?\" one of my cousins said she was scared and began crying. i wasn't cared, exactly. more like filled with a frightening awe. we stood there, in the dark, watching this craft for about ten minutes. suddenly, the craft shot up - straight up - at an incredible speed - like a rocket. it was out of sight in a few seconds. my sister said \"nobody's going to believe us.\" but we all ran inside nonetheless, yelling and screaming, to tell our parents. they didn't believe us. four of went back outside, i think in the hope we'd see another one. (this was about fifteen minutes later.) off in the distance i heard that distinctive whop-whop of a helicopter getting closer and i remember us kids said to each other 'now that is a helicopter.\" then we heard a second helicopter. they also came out of the southwest, also flying just above treetops, so we heard them long before we saw them. both had searchlights on, scanning the ground. i was, strangely, more frightened of the helicopters - what they meant just being there -  than of the craft i'd seen earlier. nervously, we all ran back inside. none of us kids talked about what we'd seen. it was obvious no one would believe us. so, i kept quiet about what i'd witnessed when i was twelve years old.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":67132,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.2080593,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06262015-0053","longitude":-82.2075942,"occurred":15966000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1435325639000,"summary":"My cousins and i witnessed a ufo in early evening; it hovered  over a nearby barn.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"33541","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":16427,"locationName":"Zephyrhills, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:23838"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Gloucester Township","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My my brother thinks that on february 13th 2015 he brought an alien life form home with him from a friends house. the aliens  can make themselves invisible but has let him see them. they are not aloud to talk to him so they communicate by touch. for instance, 1 touch for yes or 2 for no when he asks questions. at first he says there were over 50 but now there is only one female that has claimed him.She says that the males of her race no longer have genitalia so they are here to be impregnated in hopes to have male children  to reproduce. it takes them 3 days to get here from...I think it's name was mintaka. the 3rd star in orion's belt. they use dark matter engines and can reach speeds not imaginable. 1000s of times the speed of light. they have been here for many years. there species along with 4 other alien races that she knows of helped to create the pyramids and other things on earth. so far this is all i know. he has said that she was ok with me meeting her but to tell you the truth, i'm scared. i can send you his text message to an email address that you provide. which go farther into detail. i am sort of a skeptic about this but from everything he has told me i think i believe him. he has never been a person to make up stories for no reason.

foothill watching. even though they were far away i could clearly see they were large.\r\n\r\none specifically kept swooping down past the tree line and coming back up and continuously did this at separate paces. i believe from what i remember that i saw another light below the trees on the foothill on the other side of the one under the clouds and objects. i thought i was imagining it even in that situation. they often made impossible turns and dropped height to gain height in impossible ways as if they had their own rules on gravity like they could have their own foci point, but bend it at their will. their was a lot of them in the sky they were swooping around, dipping, flipping, turning and i would have to say they were showing off like they were dancing. the way they moved was imposiable. \r\n\r\nthat object in the trees rose out of it and i was starting to worry. the one from the trees was just like the others, yet i felt a little unsettled by it. i hoped if it was on a road no one was harmed by it and i haven't investigated if their was. \r\n\r\nthe cloud burst in areas to let out other sphere like, burning like faintly seemingly on fire. this began to scare me. the cloud was a nest. their had to be hundreds in that mass cloud. i was terrified and i think i stayed in the chair, hoping they couldn't see me. i knew the ones that were there were going to leave soon and they did. one stayed behind for a while with another that seemed to vibrate from one specific focal point to another back and forth. it was an odd short distance. the other kept itself close, but zig zagged. i could see in the cloud, but my recollection is misty when i try to remember i feel light headed. the last thing i remember about the cloud is that all the things disappeared into it and i saw inside of it briefly. from those few seconds i remember i can confidently say there were mass numbers.\r\n\r\ni forgot about the incident for the rest of the day. only when i got home and my memory was triggered i felt excitement to tell my parents. my mother believed me and when i tell others they seem insulted or look at me odd. i often forget about this and i hope i can remember it tomorrow. when i remember a single part of the incident it slowly unravels and i begin to remember, just like remembering dreams. this is not the first flying thing i have seen in the sky. i often see other odd things around where i live, but we all seem to forget about the incidents or care less. it happens, so often, but ufo's are a rare incident. this is a regular thing for many of us where i live. i know from my own experiences and the only other person i know that takes notice to these events that there is something uncanny here. i want to know what it all this mesns...","distance":"Over

riding around it was about 8:30 pm.(not quite all the way dark yet) i was driving and i noticed a bright light in the sky and was thinking its too light out to be a star. my wife fussed at me bout not paying attention to the road when i showed her what i was looking at, she started to say it was a radio tower light when the object appeared to drop two objects out of it. the objects circled around the larger object then took off in different directions. within a few moments one of the objects flew directly overhead. i couldn't make out all the details of it but the lights were white and flickering like a strobe light.  i told my son when we got back home and he didn't believe me. \r\n\r\na couple weeks later, i returned home from work around 8pm. i saw the object again around in the same place. i told my son, and we both went outside to watch after bout 20 minutes the object just disappeared. we watched for a lil while longer and as we were geting ready to go inside we witnessed a lot of planes and other objects in the sky. some seemed to be normal planes with normal light coloring. then we started seeing objects that look like planes but had orange and green colored lights and made no sound. after awhile of watching these we started seeing triangle shaped objects.  then we seen one that seemed to be traveling a lot lower and slower then the others. i ran inside to get my binoculars. when i looked through i could clearly see three lights on the tips of the triangle. as we watched, there was a large bright orange ball of light that emitted from the front of the triangle that appeared to engulf the front half of the triangle as the light retracted the triangle changed shape into that of a plane. i looked through the binoculars again and now can clearly see that it had wings like a plane with the lights in normal position for a plane but were still orange and green. i was completely amazed it was like something seen in the movies. it flew off to the south and there wasn't any activities in sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

for the night. my one friend and i we're sitting outside under the canopy when her and i both noticed something glowing in the sky moving rapidly at the same moment. i was seeing one orb behind her from where i was sitting and she was seeing one passing on the other side of the canopy. we both jumped up to see what it was and as we did we started counting. we were counting 1 or after another coming from the southern direction single file, flying north northwest and gaining altitude as they traveled. the very last one came 2-3 minutes after the other 12 we saw.None of them made any sound, and they almost seemed translucent. while they were in single file they were very low i would guess a hundred feet above the treetops moving rapidly, after that they shot very high in the sky. they kind of danced around and then three of them formed a triangle formation then we watch the triangle turn directions but still in the same place in the sky. we observed this for about 15 to 20 minutes before one by one they all just disappeared high in the sky. one thing that was very strange was we saw a plane come out of nowhere it seemed, it was a very large aircraft the size of a commercial airliner and was lower than the line of pine trees at the property line! the lights on the front of it appeared to shine through the trees then the plane ascended into the sky in a s, sw direction where one of the orbs look like it went directly underneath the plane from the front. that same night we saw similar reports on ufo sights in the area, and the next day we called the local airports no pilots have reported seeing anything unusual. one woman we spoke to ended up telling us about her report of orbs in new york in the sixties though.","distance":"101-500

of my eye watching the light also, we said nothing.\r\n\r\nthe light grew brighter, became larger but did not move, i let off the gas, don't know why and we coasted. about 10 seconds after it appeared it blazed even brighter white light and left extremely fast in an upward right hand curve.  if i drew it, it would look like a horn of plenty.  as the object left the light grew wide and fast.  in one second it left a perfect lighted horn of plenty in the sky!  most remarkable was this>  when the object left, the atmosphere appeared to suck the light back into itself back to the original take off point, like when you drop a rock into the water.\r\n\r\nwe were amazed and talked non stop.  we pulled into a restaurant for breakfast and brought up again, \"the guys in the control tower had to see it too!\"  my father in law was a national airline security director and most stations knew him by face and name.  using his name i actually got a hold of the palm beach intl. control tower.  this would be much harder today i bet if even you knew someone but i got a hold of one of the operators on duty.  i introduced my self using my father in law's name and title.  then i asked, \"about fifteen minutes ago, directly east of you towards the atlantic, did you see a light leave the atmosphere at a high rate of speed?\"  \r\n\r\nthe answer was extremely fast, i hardly finished speaking, i was very calm. he was not calm at all.  \"we didn't see anything\" and he hung up with a slam.  he saw it, i could tell.  he was also pretty scared.\r\n\r\nif he didn't see it, a report of an object in the sky near restricted air space would have prompted a lot of questions, his job of course.\r\n\r\nthat's it.  the light sucking back in like a vacuum and the perfect picture made us positive it

barking and i looked out the window and saw 4 lights off in the distance coming towards my house. i thought it was a plane but realized as it got closer it wasn't a plane. i went outside to get a better look. once i was outside i saw a triangle shaped object with 5 lights underneath with a dome on top and a light coming out of the dome. i saw two silohuetts of whatever was inside this thing. while it moved like a plane, it was way to low to be a plane and didn't make any sound. it moved in a straight line and passed directly over my house, i was absolutely terrified. i ran inside to get my phone to take a picture but it was gone by the time i got back outside.","distance":"101-500
