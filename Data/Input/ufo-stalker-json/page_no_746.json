what i first thought were contrails left by an aircraft, except that they were not in a straight line as you would expect. instead it was all close in the form of a misshaped heart. we kept looking at it for some reason glued to the sight when i noticed like a pin spot of light at one end of that contrail, all of a sudden it started to get brighter and brighter to the point that the starlit sky became blue like during daylight and no stars were visible, i don't know how long this lasted but we remained glued to the event until the light started to slowly diminished and i could not see the light source and the stars returned. it was at this time that we looked at each other and dashed inside as all the dogs in the area started howling at once. i could not tell you with any certainty how long this event took place as we were mesmerized throughout the event.\r\nby the way, a few years later my mother and sister saw a disk shaped object fly from the roof of their condominium to their eye level very close to them, and started moving towards them until my sister started screaming then it moved away slowly. neighbors came out and saw it also, i was away in the military at the time

years. we have told friends but never reported them. now it's time. i personally have seen 4 different types of objects in the past 10-12 years.From about 2004 to the present. the first one was an object with rotating blue,red,green and yellow lights. this was at night.  it was hovering above the tree line on the hill across from my house,it started moving up and down rising above and descending below the trees.Then moved back and forth. i watched it for about 30-35 minutes. then it shot off. i believe this same one a few months ago,was the same one that about 1am four helicopters came flying over the holler where i live and i saw the object bolt to the north at amazing speed and disappear in a bright flash of light. we still observe it regularly.\r\n the second type of object i saw was up close on a bright sunny day. no more than 50-60 ft. and is my favorite. i live a mile off a black top road,up a dirt road. along my property before turning in the driveway is really grown up with natural wild growth of tall weeds and grasses. i turned in the driveway and to my right in the small field below my pond was a cigar shaped,opaque and shimmering (like the inside of an oyster shell)craft,just hovering above the ground. as i drove slowly up the driveway, it just glided along up towards the pond and vanished. while i was watching it i had the feeling of joy and happiness. it was wonderful! i will never forget that experience.\r\n the third type of object i saw in daylight,was a silver cigar shaped solid craft that was moving slowly at an odd angle,not like a plane. i pulled over at the little country store and watched it for a few minutes. a man got out oh his truck and i asked him what he thought it was. he said it looks like a plane. i asked him if he could hear it, he said no. then i asked him if he had ever seen a plane fly at that angle, he said no. i asked him if he still thought it was a plane.. he said well yeah. lol! i honestly tried to get him to open his eyes and mind.\r\n this last object.. my husband, my neighbor and myself see all the time lately. it is a very bright white large orb. sometimes it close and sometimes farther away. usually it just hovers. but we watch it anyway. last week one night after my husband went to bed(about 11:30 or so). i went out to see if it was there and it was. i had a bright idea to get my laser pointer out and try something. i took the pointer and began making spirals (fibonacci-sequence,and the golden ratio). i made about 5 of them and this object shot backwards till i could barely see it. i watched it a few seconds and thought it was gone..Turned to go back in the house and looked back and there it was. it is a regular visitor.\r\n thank you for letting me share my experiences. i was scared to go public with them,but i figured why not. keep your eyes to the sky!!!\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

something i will go very closer to the object. triyng to get a contact cause with time i am questionning myself if they were trying to get my attention at the exit with this flashing light. i felt that they want me to go to the building where they were heading. but i was sceptic, why me. \r\n\r\ni am not crazy and my wife do not believe me.... i did not talk to anyone else about that....

while in maine i met a woman at the lodge and i befriended her with a cup of coffee ( which was not in the lodge because they frowned on caffine) so i invited her to my cabin.  she informed me she was the  entertainment for the evening.  she happened to be a physic - which she was not born with but became one after a very severe accident.    she did a reading for me because i had befriended her at  the lodge.  she told me things about my current life which were dead on correct - then she said she had something else to tell me  but was not sure i was ready for it - and i said to her to \"go for it\".  she said that my mother was taken by aliens when she was pregnant with me and they implanted something in her that was to merge with the baby in her uterus ( which was me)    from there she said that they took me several times over many years  and they finally realized that the merge never took place and upon that knowledge they erased my memories  -   i was born in manchester new hampshire in 1948   - i understand that in1947 manchester was a hot spot for sightings of alien aircraft.   when i was 2 years old my mom had a partial historectomy because she had been having awful problems for a couple of years.  the doctors informed my mom that they removed something from her that had been in her for 2 years and their best guess was that it was my twin ( no one knew i had a twin)    i grew up in a trailer since my dad was in the air force and we moved from base to base - my mom said that i drove her crazy because i could get out of the trailer even when she was standing outside my bedroom door - this something she would tell me all through growing up  - i could escape from anywhere it seemed.  at 7 my dad died and we moved to mass. from kansas to live with my grandmother.  over the years i thought my lack remembering my early years was due to the death of my dad  - because my life begins at 7 years old.  well, not sure i have told the story well - but was wondering if you have other stories like this one.   sincerely  marsha

City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was about 1:12 am. i was out on my back porch listening to the radio and looking at the sky. i saw an airplane that must have been at least 5-10 miles away from where i was viewing and at a very high altitude. it was a very clear sky so i had no problem seeing the outline of the plane and could see the lights flashing. i remember thinking well i wish i could be up there with you pilots. \r\n\r\nthen not even a minute later. i noticed this extremely bright light coming in from the corner of my eye traveling southwest. it was definitely moving faster than any conventional aircraft, but i could tell it was not moving full speed. i could see the light coming through a large tree before i got a full view of the object. as soon as i saw the light coming through the tree and saw how bright it was and how large it was i got up to get a better view of it once it passed the tree in my backyard.\r\n\r\nto my surprise it was a very very large pure white sphere traveling across the sky. didn't seem like it was descending. was just traveling in a straight path in the sky. this object was brighter than the moon in the sky that night, brighter than any full moon i have ever seen. it was almost the size of the moon in the sky. there is no way this thing was a plane. it was simply massive. i've never seen any type of craft as large as this. football fields upon football fields. \r\n\r\nthe light emitting from the craft was extremely white, white as paper, whiter than any man made light i have ever seen. whiter and brighter than the light that is reflected by the moon. i live near an airport and enjoy watching various jets, civilian planes, helicopters, etc, every single night. not even the brightest spotlight from helicopters could even touch on the scale of how bright this object was. \r\n\r\nit made absolutely no sound as it passed by. had no trail of any kind. i have seen hundreds of shooting stars, even a major meteor that was reported on my local news. that one was pretty bright but nothing like this and that had a trail and was descending as well. the way this was moving made it clear to me as soon as a saw it that it was being intelligently controlled.\r\n\r\nwhen i first noticed the object i immediately thought it was a ufo. it was too large and bright to be a meteor, and traveled on such a straight not descending path. the amount of energy it would require to generate that much light made it clear to me it was not a meteor or something falling into the atmosphere. the path was just too linear for that.\r\n\r\nas soon as i saw it i felt that i was witnessing something with a tremendous amount of energy being generated. unfortunately my house was in the way of its path so i only saw this object for 40-60 seconds, but that was more than enough. the sheer size of it and brightness. helicopters 100 feet off the ground wouldn't even compare. \r\n\r\ni have seen before what i thought was a ufo it was a bright orange disk that i saw fly by some power lines several years ago. that was brighter than any aircraft i had ever seen, plus our aircraft don't illuminate the entire outline of the craft. even that did not compare to the sighting i had tonight. \r\n\r\ni never imagined i would see anything else like that again, it was really a treat to see.

out loud, but i was thinking how weird it is to smell so strongly of sulfur when normally all you would smell is manure. we made it to our friends house and left around 6:30 pm it was now dark. when driving east past the local campground in the same area as cattle barn i spotted a 50 foot wide triangular ufo to the south hovering above the trees. i knew immediately, i was seeing something incredible. the ufo was dark metal in color almost black. in the center was a raised stainless steel triangular badge with an amber light flashing amber, white, off sequentially. on the upper corners were green dim lights that seemed to be casting light across the front of the object. i believe the ufo was conical in shape, but it was definitely triangular and hovering silently. i had my head out of the car window and shouted for my friend to stop the truck, i was so worked up, we were in a car. he slowed down and looked past me and confirmed what i was seeing, but wouldn't stop. we turned off the end of the road heading south and i could see it still for roughly another kilometer. after we got back to his place we discussed it and he was in denial big time, i left, took a bus home. walking home from the bus stop i saw two military helicopters returning to the local base. i like 2 kilometers from the cfb 14wing and i am used to seeing many military aircraft every day. as well we have a small municipal airport which flies cessna type planes. this was not a plane. it was two months before my friend finally came to terms with what happened and now admits it was definitely unidentifiable. we were both psychologically affected by this event. it was weeks before i could sleep well and move on with my life. we did not photograph the object unfortunately i did not have my

military aircraft since we did live near two air force bases the largest being hill air force base. since that day i have seen many triangle shapes in videos and pictures some on history channel mufon

looking at andromeda galaxy when i suddenly lost sight of it when i pulled away from the telescope i saw about 40 to 60 twinkling lights moving slowly all together, my first thought was \"oh cool the iss\"  but then as it moved further away i seen the silhouette in the glow of the city lights and i noticed a v shape with a line of the twinkling lights on the edges of the wings or side of the craft. i watched it as it blocked out stars and moved further away for about 6 to 8 minutes until it was no longer in sight. i looked at andromeda galaxy again but was soon bored knowing what i just seen so i called my girlfriend and excited i told her what i saw but she said i was crazy and just must be tired so i never really talked about it after that. i went outside to get my telescope scanning the sky but no more ufo was there so i went inside and did not sleep much that night, very puzzled and excited.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

3 people, including myself saw. what made me report this was i saw a tv show on history channel that spoke of a very similar experience after seeing the ufo's. these things also happened to me and i would like to further understand what happened. i will disclose these at a later time if you contact me in a way other than a public forum but it consists of small orbs in my house as well as dark shadowy figures.\r\n\r\nmy observations happened over the course of 3 days time. the first night i observed a bright light outside the window. there was something odd about it so i decided to go to the window to look at it. the light floated like a humming bird in the sky and i thought it might have been a helicopter but there was absolutely no sound. i observed this for about 20 minutes and this light would grow large, then small and moved like nothing i have ever seen before! as i watch it moved down the coast it stopped and hovered at a place to the left and a red beam of light came down from it at an angle of about a 45 degree to the left towards the ground. this beam pulsed and looked as though the cycling rate made the light look like it was moving upwards. i lost sight of it for about 10 seconds as it began to move again now down the coast to the right and passed by tree tops. i caught sight of it again 10 seconds later further up in the air. it hovered there for about 5 minutes, floating like a bee, making slight direction changes like a ping pong ball floating on a column of air. the light grew very bright and increased in size, then got dim, very dim to the point it almost disappeared from view and repeated this, alternating from large to small over the 5 minutes it remained there. all of a sudden the light shot straight up in the air and as it moved upwards, it looked like the stars warped around it and then returned to normal position.\r\n\r\nthe second night, i was watching for them at the same time of day. sure enough it was there only this time there were 3 of them. i called my ex-spouse to observe the objects in the sky and she became scared because they were not helicopters or airplanes. these objects moved around the sky very quickly and changed direction instantly! no plane or helicopter can do that. they also made no noise and at times came very close to where i was observing. (about 1/2 to 1 mile away). it looked like they were searching for something.\r\n\r\nthe third night, i had made mention to a friend earlier that day that if they were going to be there again that night, i was going to observe them from the beach. i kick myself that i never thought to grab a camera. that night, they were there so i called my friend and we both met at the beach and observed them flying over the water/ocean. it appeared that one of the craft was on the water and a triangle of red lights sat on the water. at one point a beam of white light, almost like a spot light scanned the boardwalk and stopped upon me and my friend momentarily. i gave it the finger and the light moved onward continuing down the shoreline to my right and then turned off.I made mention to my friend, \"look, there are all these cars driving by and not one of them sees what we are watching?\" we watched them for about 40 minutes and one flew directly over our heads. it was very large, and the lights were shaped like a square with one large white light in the center of the square. it flew about 1000 feet over our heads and made no sound at all. once this object passed over head, the other objects had gone and i didn't see them return again and all that was left in the sky was the occasional airplane.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
