beautiful,almost swirling affect to them,he looked at me and said nothing,but i got the impression he wanted me to look over at the rest of my room,next to him,another entity w/in a foot,i looked at it,it \"acknowleged\"me as well,and then in the corner of my room,right by the window.I then looked back at the closest,he was looking at me,and we seemed to be talking,telepathically,he assured me that i was safe,and they were there to do no harm,(i have been really sick for a long time with chronic infection,and in and out of the dr and hospital).He tilted his head and looked at me,as he \"understood i did not feel well\"all most \"sympathetic\"i will never forget his face,and how kind i felt he was.I was never scared.I looked at him again,confirming my safety,and that they were just going to \"watch me\"or something,i looked at the other 2 told them all i was \"going back to sleep then\".The closest one looked at me as if to \"approve\"and i went back to sleep.When i woke,i was afraid to tell my family,i never have had dreams like this,it was so clear,and vivid,and every detail,i went over in my head again,and again.When i awoke,i searched my body for some sign,and found a \"silver dollar size\"ring on my stomach,to date,nothing has taken it away.I am profoundly affected by this as i do not believe in alien abduction!!!Ever!Though i have seen many crafts all through my life,beginning at age 5,and having actually been \"followed\"by a u f o,all accounts witnessed,i never believed that aliens would bother with humans!!!I am confused,ashamed,embarrassed,and very distraught over the whole encounter.Now,questioning my sanity.Please,is there any definitive way to know??I am thinking about renting or buying a geiger counter,because i hear they leave traces of radiation?Maybe hypnosis?A lie detector?Anything,so i know i'm not crazy!!The circle all most looks like \"ringworm\"but has not responded to any medications,cortisone,ketoconozole,any anti fungals,covered,uncovered,the only thing it seems to respond to is \"zinc oxide\"","distance":"20 Feet or

tells me. my last sighting was last july i watched a ufo chase a fire ball across the southwestern sky. the ufo was 3 times the size of the fireball which was really big itself. the ufo seemed camouflaged but was a visible round cylinder. i checked local newspapers the next day for ufo sightings in the area. the only report that i found on the internet were several people traveling on california interstate 10 westbound out of blythe who saw the fireball. my other siting was 12 years ago in the mountains of bishop california 2am in the morning which no one would believe me if i even disclose it in this report. i also have had my right had ex-rayed which shows a small splinter looking metal object between my pinky finger and ring finger. they have no idea what it is, it does not

and sees a bright wide light beam shining on river and the light is coming from a huge object, flying just above treetop level. the object is long enough to well cover both sides of the river and it's slowly heading their way. \r\n\r\nthis thing doesn't make any engine noise or plane / helicopter rotor noise; it is totally silent but clearly under some control and steady speed, moving very slowly. \r\n\r\ndad and grandfather manage to hide their boat behind a heavy low hanging tree branches just along river bank, where they're getting a good look at the ufo as it flies directly over them. grandfather shut his eyes; he was very scared, and began whispering the lord's prayer. dad, however, tried to see all he could of this ufo. he recalled seeing barely inside the opening of the craft that projected the blinding white light; his impression was the ufo was searching inside the river for something. he wasn't able to distinguish the source of the intensely bright light shining down upon them and the river, other than it covered nearly a large square area of the river.\r\n\r\ndad isn't sure to this day, being that this all happened many years ago,  but he seems to feel that the natural sounds of the outdoors suddenly ceased as the ufo glided over them--only to hear them again, when the craft moved away from them.\r\n\r\nonce the object had moved down river and away from them, grandfather and dad got the boat out, started the boat engine and sped scared away from the ufo--which they looked behind them, to make sure it wasn't coming back. dad said the object didn't whoosh away up into space; it remained on it's slow course, as they made distance away from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat my dad didn't know: my grandmother, back in 1977, told me this very same account,as told her by my grandfather when they got back; he never spoke of it again. she recalled how scared he was and how excited dad had been. she also told me that the one time, a couple of years later, she tried to discuss the ufo sighting-- my grandfather quickly became angrily upset, demanding nothing more ever was spoken about it.\r\n\r\nif deemed fit for further mufon investigation, i'd have to ask dad if he would be willing to himself speak to an investigator. my cellphone number is the perferred way to contact me.\r\n\r\nthis is not the only ufo sighting my father claims: there are two others, but i'm not clear enough of the details to discuss them here.

began to move in all directions. at this point i thought it could be an rc helicopter, but it would have had an incredible range, and it was moving in ways that wouldn't have been possible even for an

for something or doing something, or possibly a test flight. there was a reddish light further in the distance that would disappear and reappear and move in the same manner as the first. after some time it ascended above the hills into the sky, hovered in place, and took off into the sky in an instant, faster then ive ever seen anything move. it looked like a shooting star going away from the earth. after a minute or two a light just appeared in the area it was flying, light a light switch turned on, and the object continued to ascend and descend and move at varying speeds in all directions, stopping and hovering occasionally. it moved very abruptly, unpredictably, with abrupt stops as well. i stood in awe and felt like a presence, like i wasn't the only one on the road. it was eerie. after a good amount of time of what seemed like random flight patterns, finally it ascended into the sky and took off again, it looked like warp speed or something. it was almost

house in sperry, ok. it was close to 9:00pm, still having some daylight but starting to get dark. i told the girls it was time to get out and go to their grandma's house. my youngest daughter gets out of the pool, away from the shrubbery, looks up and says, \"what is that?\" she's young, a little paranoid sometimes, so with me still being in the pool and whatever she was looking at out of my view i dismissed her concern and said that it was probably an airplane. even more so setting my mind at ease is the fact that there are quite a few wealthy people in the area so its not uncommon to see someone flying an older plane, something she may not recognize. my aunt and uncle had already went inside for the evening, but the girls noticed her grandson left his shoes out by the pool and that my aunt had left her drink outside too. they started knocking on the door to the house because it for some reason was already locked, but no answer. i was still by the pool getting dried off, but thought it was rather strange that no one could hear them knocking and calling for them. once dried enough to leave, i decided to go help the girls try to get my aunt's and/or uncle's attention. i walked over to the clearing by the door and started knocking and calling for my aunt, but no one answered. they had only went in a couple of minutes before we were getting out of the pool, they couldn't be asleep. i got a rather uneasy feeling, and for whatever reason my daughters question as to what was in the sky came front of mind. i looked up and saw two lights coming from a stationary object, the object itself was disc shaped and dark. i repeated my daughter's question back to both of my girls, \"what is that?\" at this point i felt like we were being watched and i wanted to leave. i told the girls to put the cup and the shoes they were trying to take inside on the table outside and that we needed to go. i walked back over towards the pool to grab our bag of towels, and when i walked back over to the clearing i felt compelled to look again. so i did, it was much closer than it was before, still just hovering. i noticed that the object was completely silent as well, and for some reason related it somehow to my aunt and uncle not being able to hear us. the girls looked back up in the sky before walking to the car, and also noticed how much closer the object was with its lights seeming to be pointing in our direction and they started becoming frantic. we got to the car and started to drive off, but to our surprise, when we got to the end of the driveway, the object was just above the trees across from the driveway almost as if it knew where we were going and was there waiting on us. it was so close at this point that my heart just sank, it was within 100 feet. to me that confirmed my suspicion that it was somehow after us. in my mind, i felt panicked. seeing this object on the other side of the street meant that this object switched paths from heading south to facing the north without anyone seeing, hearing, noticing. i mean it's a pretty rural area, but it made me feel even more alone in trying to protect my children from whatever this thing is stalking us, but making its presence known. we turned east onto the rural road and it followed to the right of us. i lost sight of it as i was focusing on driving and trying to hightail it out of there, but the girls could see it. everyone is panicked now. the youngest was in the backseat and i heard her start crying and then praying. i gave the older of the two my cell phone and told her to call her step dad, he answered, but the call dropped. i turned some christian music on and started praying with the girls. it either left at that point, or else we just could no longer see it, either way was fine with me as showing itself out in the open seemed pretty confident and aggressive. if its hiding now at least the agression has somewhat simmered down, if its just gone then thank goodness even more so. we got to my parents house and i felt one of the biggest reliefs of my life. although, i barely slept in the night and noticed every single noise. strangely, about 10 years ago something very similar happened close to the same area. i would say probably within a 5 to 10 mile parameter. it was july 4th 2005 to be exact, evening time i believe. my ex husband and i were driving, taking the back roads. i believe we were actually on a road just two blocks south of the one from the june 24th incident, just a few miles east. we were driving, and when we came into a clearing, we saw a low flying object just hovering. we both noticed it, and then it silently started moving towards us. he started speeding, and i just kept looking at it. i gave it a glare with the thought in my head, whatever i have to do to protect my kids, i'll do it. our oldest two were in the backseat and i was pregnant at the time. i don't know if it had anything to do with my thought of no holds barred, but at that it simply started moving away from us.

getting into madera ca gateway drive i was sitting in the back seat of car my friends mom told us look there is 2 ufo's. my first reaction was what ever there no ufo's sitting there when she pointed them out i was shocked, my friend  as well. at this time it was like 7:45pm close to 8 pm it was just dark enough to see the lights that were just sitting in the sky floating or what i call it floating on water like a ship floats in the ocean it was amazing to see. my friend pulled over on gateway drive right under the floating light we jumped of the car and watched the ufo's just float in the air for like 3-5 minutes. we wachted in amazement on how the lights faded from color to color red,white, blue, purple,green,yellow, it had two rings of lights  one bigger then the other it look like they were communicating to each other after a few minutes one took off east floating away traveling no more then maybe 2-5 miles hrs. the other ufo started traveling north on gateway going 2-5 mph. it was making a full circle as it floated down the main road of our town it almost look like they were surveying the town. as it traveled it would come to a complete stop at our 9oclk and just float for 15-30 seconds then it repeated the same movement 3 different times stopping 1st over our museum park you could see it thru the tree lines then it stopped over the tallest building during that time madera valley in the last stop was made over the greyhound station. after the greyhound the ufo floated away towards the driving theater area my friend dropped me off at my home. from my house i could see the light still floating in the driving theater area my town is small so i called my nephew that lived right behind that theater drive inn i told him to look for the light while we were on the phone. he started screaming it's a ufo at that time my nephew was maybe 12-14 years old. so i just watched the lights from my house for 3 hrs as the floated away traveling nw towards san jose ca. i have never seen something like that again. i'm 39 years old now i still wonder what i saw that night i know for a fact it was not an aircraft that we have on earth even now almost 19 years later.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then
