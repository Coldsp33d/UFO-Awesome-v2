States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"During an overnight patrol, myself and close to 20 other marines came close to calling a security alert on an object, which was flying over restricted area. \r\n\r\na mobile patrol unit of (2) marines first spotted the object ejecting what looked like sparks into the sky. the mobile unit immediately reported the sighting as a \"rocket ship\" to the alarm control center (acc) via coded radio. the acc responded to the mobile unit: \"be advised, at ease on the net\", asking the mobile unit to stop fooling around on the radio. the mobile unit immediately repeated the aforementioned sighting of a \"rocket ship\" and included the location of the sighting. i was also part of a mobile patrol unit and had also witnessed the earlier sighting. \r\n\r\ni however, didn't witness the object as a \"rocket ship\", because rockets leave a trail of smoke, flames, sound, and move at high speeds. this particular object made little to no sound. i could hear the faint crackling of the sparks, as the object slowly moved south. the sparks had the same duration and look of a common july 4th sparkler, just on a much larger scale. once i made a positive id on (the sighting) and not necessarily the craft, i followed up with a call to the acc corroborating the initial call from the other mobile patrol unit. i was instructed to contact the acc via landline to keep all chatter off of the radio. \r\n\r\ni stopped at an observation tower to call the acc. i described everything we are witnessing and also asked instructions, as the craft was in a no-fly zone and over a nuclear warhead limited area. the sergeant of the guard ordered us to standby as he called the installation commander and/or the navy. by this time, the object wasn't ejecting sparks, nor was it moving. it had changed direction and moved east just a bit and was stationary. the sparks had stopped flickering and something else was being ejected from the craft, but it was falling straight down.\r\n\r\nthe best way i can describe the substance falling from the object: plasma white molten lava. it appeared to fall all the way to the ground, but with the amount and density of the trees, i couldn't tell for certain. also.... the sighting seemed to change my perception on the scales of things. it seemed as if the white hot plasma was falling faster to the ground, than any earthly object would from that altitude. example: the object was (my best guess) a few hundred feet in the air, but the white plasma was falling as fast as a water drop from the spout into the sink. it was very weird and made me feel very small.\r\n\r\na group of us marines had gathered on the east end of the limited area to await instructions and maintain observation of the occurrence. the air was electric. static-like, is the best way i can describe it. no odor, and no sound of the white hot plasma falling through the trees. i thought it was odd, because of the size/amount that was falling. it could've been because of how bright the substance appeared to be...Making it seem bigger. i have no clue... it was very strange. the object made a noise, but it was more a feeling you can feel in your body... like an ultra low frequency hum or buzz.      \r\n\r\nthe object was never in clear view. we were able to track it by the sparks/white plasma it ejected and also the large shadow it cast in the cloud cover. although common with most ufo sightings, it didn't display any exterior lights whatsoever. we lost sight of the object once the white plasma stopped falling. we heard the low frequency hum for a few minutes afterwards but that stopped as well. also the air seemed to change as well. i could smell the ocean and it smelled very fresh.\r\n\r\nthe navy didn't respond until the next day. we never fired on the object because we couldn't identify it and it didn't seem to pose any immediate threat. the navy stated the following day, they were having an airshow, but i never believed it because of the time of the sighting and we are usually notified of any aircraft flying close to our location.\r\n\r\nit is standard sop for marines to list all occurrences into a logbook. some did and some didn't. i was one of the marines that did. all logbooks are turned in to the platoon commanders, after the logbook is filled. that was the only evidence detailing the event.  \r\n\r\nthat same week, there was an aurora borealis which lasted into sunrise. it was a weird week. \r\n\r\ni decided to come forward about this sighting, as it may add some confirmation to someone else's sighting. i'm sorry i couldn't remember the exact date, but i never witnessed but one aurora borealis in 1994. the sighting happened that same week.

fair grounds at the directors hall.  i parked in my parking stall which was covered and lit.  i am a star gazer so i am constantly looking up at the sky and look at the planets.  i also gaze through my telescope so i know what stars and planets look like.  i locked my car and started walking looking up once i cleared the roof line of the parking stall and looked up to see the stars.  i noticed out to the left a very large light and it caught my eye so i stated looking at it.  from my vantage point the light was the size of a basketball hoop basket.  i noticed it moving very slowy just hovering there in the air roughly 800' above my head.  it then started moving again and i noticed that another light same size appeared until i saw six lights in total.  two lights about 1/4 of the way from the tip of the massive triangle shaped ufo, then half way another two lights spaced further apart at the width of the craft, then the last two lights at the rear of the craft appeared.  at first it just hung there making absolutely zero noise and no air movement around me while it was hovering above me.  all noises became silent, and i couldn't take my eyes off of it.  i decided to get my iphone out and see if i could possibly record it but i just couldn't get my mind to work enough to capture it on film.  the moment i took my phone out the craft started moving sideways almost like it was sliding sideways through the air from right above me sliding to the west and it started again hovering in place.  i started walking slowing towards the south and the craft starting moving south as well.  i unlocked my phone to call my wife to let her know i was home and parked then i noticed it started moving to the south but moving back towards me while moving south as well, again with the sliding movement.  definitely movement no airplane or jet or helicopter moves.  i grew up 28 years in the flight path of the airport about 4 miles from us and we always went out to see the military jets and other aircraft fly over.  i knew this was not anything the military routinely flies.  i dialed my wife's number and as i did that it started moving faster to the south so i started jogging after it.  as my wife answered the phone the massive triangle gained about 2000' of altitude in a split second and flew over some trees.  my wife answered the phone and asked why i sounded out of breath and i told her i was running watching a massive triangle ufo flying over the apartment right now and for her to go outside to confirm what i was looking at.  she was indisposed at the time but stayed on the phone so she knew i was safe the entire time.  as i watched the lights going through the trees as i was running under trees at this point i kept a visual on it.  again this was completely silent and i started being able to hear traffic once again and the wind blowing slightly.  i cleared the tree into open sky and saw it now probably 5 miles away from me now 3-4000' within another five seconds, then the lights on the bottom that i could see started getting brighter then in the blink of an eye it accelerated out of view.  if you literally blinked your eyes you would have missed it.  never made a single sound and went faster than anything i have ever noticed ever in my life.  from the back i could see that there was a dome like structure on the bottom of the rear of the massive triangle.  after it was out of sight i walked to the apartment unit we lived in at the time and my wife could tell i was sweaty from running after it and looked almost pale in the face with very wide eyes not able to blink.  i should also say this isn't the first experience i have had with ufos.  my wife and i have both witnessed three other ufos but not as in depth.  my wife asked what took me so long to get from the parking lot to the apartment and i said what do you mean it was only like 30-40 seconds and she told me no you were 10 minutes.

asked my friend what he thought it could be we both agreed that it looks like a satellite. but we both agreed that it was way too low and bright to be possible without any sign of re-entry into the atmosphere and that it was on a path just like a plane. as it passed to our right side we could see that it was emitting light on all sides which planes and helicopters do not do. the object did not have blinking lights like conventional aircraft are required to have. we watched with much curiousity as it moved directly overhead making no noise at all and disappeared from our view behind some trees on our side of the street. having a small airport in town and reno-tahoe international airport close by it is everyday that we see all kinds of aircraft. also having a very particular interest

hoping i am in the right direction. thank you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere goes  i am 55 7/24/59. this all started when i was 4 yrs. old in 1963. i lived in barboursville, wv. one night we saw a light over the train tracks of our house. my dad was in the usaf during the korean war and we would sit outside on the porch and look for shooting stars. we saw this bright light and he thought it was a shooting star but all of the sudden it stopped and turned directions and came at our house. it stopped over our house but was too high to see what it was other than a bright light that changed colors. this was the first time, the next time i was 8 and my uncle was a major in the usaf stationed in coco beach fla. we would go on vacation and he would invite us to their house to watch the rocket shots that they would launch from there. we had been there quit awhile listening to the countdown was way cool at the age of 8. at about t minus  30 the countdown was interrupted. of course everyone was bummed out. when all of the sudden a bright light shot on to the launch area and we saw and heard jets taking off and flying toward the light. the light seemed to play with the jets for a few min. then just shot up into the sky. the launch was canceled and my uncle came home that night and of course we were asking him what had happened. he told us he could not tell us anything and to please never ask him about again. well we all knew what we had seen, he never invited us to come up to see that again and he told us that his commander had told all the military personal not to invite anyone again to see those shots. he  was a major  in the usaf with nassa. the next experience was when i was 14 we had moved up on a farm and i was out late at night ridding my motorcycle. all of the sudden i felt like someone was watching me i stopped my dirt bike and looked up in the sky and again i saw a bright light hovering over me. it made no noise just hovered over me it would make mind bending moves up down left right in high speed maneuvers knew it was not anything i had ever seen before. the next time i saw something i was in the usaf stationed at bentwaters/woodbridge in england. my duty station was on the woodbridge side and was next to the forest. for some reason that night i decided to go from our barracks back over to my duty station. i got on the bus that took you between the bases got off at the mess hall picked up a few sandwiches for the night shift and there was a short cut through the forest that we all always took. i saw these bright lights again and i started running to my duty station to tell anyone i could tell so i would know i was not going crazy. i got to my duty station and started telling the sgt. on duty and he told me he did not want to talk about what he had seen and if i knew what was good for me i would not tell anyone else about it either. someone came by our duty station and i could hear them telling him to keep his mouth shut about what he thought he had seen. they did not know i was there because i was not supposed to be there. he came inside and i asked him what all that was about and again he looked like he had seen a ghost and begged me not to mention it again. about 3 days later the sgt. left the base and no one would say where he went. they just said he was tdy and that we did not need to know. at the time the talk was we had a secret base in or around egypt and that is where he went. our afc was aero space ground equipment a glorified gas station attendant. i mentioned this to one of the osi personal on the base( wp) he asked me what i had seen. i told him and was sent to clovis nm a few days later under the endangered airman's act. i went from clovis to panama city fl. where again i saw a ufo i never told anyone about that sighting. it seemed like every 4 yrs. i would see one of these sightings. i have lost time a few different times. i think to this day i am being visited or something is going on with me. i will go to bed and have these awful dreams about being on a stretcher and having someone above me. although i don't feel scared of what they are doing to me i feel scared of what they look like. i keep hearing in my head how they will not hurt me and that i will not remember them being there. i can't say i really remember as it seems like a dream but the dream keeps happening over and over. it’s not a nightly dream but an every few years dream, but it is always the same dream. i can't explain it but it seems that i see these objects ever 4 to 5 years. i have always felt my luck changes and my life seems to equal out in that time. i have never told anyone about this and hesitate to tell you all about it, but i have to tell someone. thanks mark

chair a ufo came up from behind a mountain and went south at a speed i calculated at 6000 mph in less than two and a half seconds and that means they had to have inertial dampening or a person would have been a greasy spot on one side of the ufo. the next day it came up from beyond the same mountain and headed south east and same speed and showed no signs of propulsion did not make any sound such as breaking the sound barrier, no protrusions showing such as a cockpit, was a grayish gun metal color and did not reflect light as a shiny object would. one wold have had to be looking at the place it came up from or else one would not see it as it gores so fast and if one looked away and back it would be gone. like a bowl put together with a flange all the way around it but the rest was smooth.\r\n\r\nthey are here and have been most likely for perhaps billions of years and i  say that because objects were found in africa, metal balls with groves around the equatorial region and they date back in time of 2.8 billion years! so many anomalies everywhere that cannot be explained otherwise!\r\n\r\n\r\nanother incident that happened to me was in a safeway store and a at least seven foot tall man was talking to a cashier that had angered me at another time and i had detrimental thoughts about her and then turned my thoughts to the man and he had a long wool black coat on as it was winter time and my thought was i wonder if he is one of the men in black and have no idea why i had that thought but when i kept walking and got even with that aisle my right arm went up into the air and i did a military right face and he was looking down his nose at me. i looked him up and down a couple of times and he was wearing a tuxedo and had on a red cummerbund and wearing a light blue shirt with the frilly stuff down the middle and he looked a bit like parnell roberts but wasn't him of course. the only thing i thought later was that he had read my thoughts and caused me to face him because he wanted a look at me. i just wish i had thought that at the time and would have requested to get acquainted, because if he was as i later thought, from some where else in our universe i sure would have liked to talk with him.\r\n\r\ni am 89 years old now but was a combat aircrewman and i see them call foo fightersa as if a french word and the they told us it was flying object observed. te

of ufo sighting tours, sedona, arizona\r\n\r\nat approximately 10:00 p.M., or just before, my 6 clients and i (7 people total) were out on a ufo sighting tour with military night vision goggles when we all saw 2 large amber colored triangle shape, hard edge, structured objects with our naked eyes.  these traveled from the northwest area of the sky beyond airport mesa in a southward direction toward cathedral rock.  the 7 witnesses were standing together on chavez ranch road turnout area.  the 2 triangle objects then made an arching turn as they headed easterly toward the chapel of the holy cross area and then disappeared to the north over munds mountain.   all witnesses were absolutely astonished and continued to discuss the sighting event for the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\n4 of the witnesses clearly saw that these were 2 distinct structured, hard edged, dark triangle shaped craft each with 3 amber or orange colored lights on the bottom, one light at each corner.   both craft were seen by the 4 witnesses with their naked eyes, without the use of the night vision goggles.  2 other witnesses saw them at close range but initially thru the goggles and could not make out the shape, only that they were huge bright lights.  one of these witnesses is a retired airline pilot with over 40 years of professional experience.  he stated emphatically that these 2 objects were remarkably faster than any plane he’d ever seen and that they were very low, much lower than commercial aircraft.  when these 2 witnesses lowered their goggles during the sighting, they and i together saw that these were 2 very large amber colored lights, but unfortunately we did not see the distinct triangle shapes, each with 3 lights in their corners, as did my other 4 clients.  all 7 of us did see the 2 objects make an arched turn while banking and continued to watch them as they disappeared over munds mountain in the distance.  please see the diagram below.\r\n\r\nadditionally, when these 2 craft were on initial approach, at the same time, a military jet at very high altitude passed over us and then another one did again as these 2 objects headed northeast.  all 7 witnesses commented that the 2 ufos were considerably lower than either of the 2 jets.  while we had no way of knowing if the 2 military jets were in pursuit of the ufos, their flight path was towards the approach of the 2 unknown objects.  it is difficult to judge the distance of the unknown objects from us, but all the witnesses expressed that the ufos were at most a few thousand feet, or less above us.  all 6 clients expressed that they are willing to be interviewed and contact information can be provided.\r\n\r\nunfortunately we were all caught up in the sighting and no photos or videos were achieved.  darn it!  better luck next time.  i have a computer diagram of the event, but i am unable to place diagram of sighting with this text.  i would like to provide diagram with my report.  if able to attach later, please see attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

saw it or was just humoring the crazy guy. a few days later i was riding my bike on m rd going west and i saw what i thought was a large red orb like thing it seemed pretty big  but i wanted to see if i could get closer. it seemed to be about 1/2 mile away. it was descending toward the ground so i was sure i would be able to get to it and see what in the world it was. i rode a half mile towards it

straight up fast and come back down to the others. we watched for several minutes as they traveled over this one area, and then several airforce jets came roaring through the sky towards the objects.  when this happened the objects took off extremely fast straight up and disappeared and we did not see them come back. i searched the newspapers and the news reports for any mention of the sighting,
