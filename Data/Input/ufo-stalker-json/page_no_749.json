light hovering in the sky. it was in the distance (roughly 20-30 miles away) and was roughly about 20,000 feet in the air. then a second light appeared close to the first. we thought it was the wing lights of some sort of plane, but the distance between the lights would have meant the plane had the biggest wingspan we’ve ever seen. then a third red light appeared and we realized it was three separate objects. they all hovered in a horizontal line. almost immediately after the third light appeared, the first one quickly dimmed and disappeared. then the second light dimmed and disappeared. after that, the third light began to rapidly fly straight up hundreds of feet in only a fraction of a second. then it instantly came to a complete stop. it began to fly around rapidly in all different directions. it would take off at speeds faster than i’ve ever seen a plane fly, then instantly stop and hover in midair. it didn’t need any time to accelerate. it would fly erratically in the air, changing directions 180 degrees in an instant without having to slow down. it could have flown circles around any airplane or helicopter with ease. after a few minutes it just disappeared. \r\nabout 20 minutes later, the three red lights appeared again, in the same order and formation as the first time. the first two lights disappeared in the same order as before, and the third light proceeded to fly erratically, but for a shorter time than before. then it disappeared.\r\nafter another 20 or 30 minutes two red lights appeared again, in a horizontal line, but were much farther apart. this viewing is harder to explain. they hovered in place just like before. then, slowly, a second red light flew out from behind each of the two lights (on the right side of one light, and on the left side of the other light). then another light came out from the behind the other side of each light (on the left side of one light, and on the right side of the other light), which equaled two sets of three lights. at this time all six of the lights were in a perfect horizontal line, with a set of three lights that was a far distance from the other set of three lights. then, the two outer lights slowly flew back in behind each center light, and the center lights became much brighter. the two outer lights continued to fly back in from the center lights, and back out from the center lights, causing the brightness of the center lights to increase and decrease. then they all disappeared. \r\nfinally, about another 20-30 minutes later, one red light appeared in the sky, much farther than where the rest had appeared. it hovered there for about one minute, and disappeared. \r\nthis happened when we were camping in the middle of nowhere in the nevada desert. we estimated the lights to be coming from in between the monte cristo range and lone mountain, which is between coaldale, nv and tonopah, nv.\r\n","distance":"Over One

and i were traveling south on highway 84 near the colorado /new mexico boarder on our way to tx.  approximately 20 minutes after sunset behind the mountains, yet while there was still enough light to see beyond the reach of headlights we were passing an open sage brush field to the east, we both noticed two large, chevron shaped objects rise up out of the ground.  both objects were silent in their operation and had lights illuminating downward from each leading point and at the end of each wing.  \r\n\r\ni would estimate our speed of travel as approximately 70 mph and were traveling in a large 3/4 ton truck, giving us an elevated view of the roadway and surrounding terrain.  the objects were not initially visible but seemed to rise either off of or out of the ground as we approached their location near the highway.  highway 84 is very rural and there were not any other vehicles in the area at the time.  i slowed slightly, and regrettably was somewhat in disbelief as to what we were both witnessing.  as we slowed we were climbing a rise in the highway which curved toward the top.  given the geography of the area we quickly lost visual on the objects.  my wife and i were both at a loss for words and were struggling to comprehend what we both just witnessed.  \r\n\r\nmy wife and i are both very well educated professionals in our community.  i am trained to be observant to detail.  i am familiar with and have more than a cursory knowledge of most military and commercial aircraft - these were neither; although i will concede they could possibly have been very large, silent, vertical take-off type drone that may not yet have been made public.  that being said, i would have no explanation as to their presence in the field that evening.  \r\n\r\ni had traveled through the area previous to our encounter and have been through twice since - on both occasions i pulled to the side of the road near where we witnessed the objects, attempting to simply male sense of what we observed, but have been unable to do so.  \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Hovering then

the story i am about to tell you.  notice my age of innocence.  notice the season of the year.  notice the clothing i am wearing.  the picture was taken in the backyard of the house we were renting on main street in commerce.  a small 2 bedroom house that needed to accommodate my mom and dad, my two sisters and i, not to mention our dog, bubbles, and my pet turtles.\r\n\tit began on a winter's day close to end of the season.  the winter had been bitterly cold and i was unable to go outdoors and play.  dad had put up a swing set in the yard to the east of the house that previous summer.  not only did it have 2 swings it also included a sliding board and a teeter totter.  i could scarcely wait for the weather to warm up so i could take advantage of that fun just waiting to happen.\r\n     during this time mom worked at home, mostly babysitting and taking in ironing.  she hated to iron but she did it for the sake of the family.  i remember many a day watching her iron her way through a stack of laundry, a stack literally taller than me.  she did the ironing in the living room, the only room big enough for the job.  it was on such a morning's day that the cold of winter subsided and mom said i could go out and play on the swing set as long as i bundled up.  she said it would take at least five hours for her to finish the ironing, then she had to wash dishes and do some house cleaning.\r\n\tjoy unspeakable.  i couldn't get my coat on fast enough.  look at the picture of me again.  the coat and hat i was wearing in the picture was the exact coat and hat i was wearing now.  rushing out the front door with that child like desire to play, it was impossible to hold myself back.  a bright light was in the way of me and the swing set.  it was an odd, intensely bright light in front of the swing set shining down from the sky like a spotlight hitting the ground directly in front of me.\r\n for me 1956 was a time of innocence.  i was young and had none to very little exposure to stories about bright lights coming down from the sky, alien encounters, or ufo's.\r\n the incident i am now continuing to tell you happened.  it was not a night dream or a day dream, not my imagination from watching tv or playing superman, not an elaborate hoax i have conceived to entertain you.  this is the absolute truth.  it did happen!  as i put this event into writing i am 64 years old and still feel like it happened yesterday.  it is vivid in my mind.  it is burned into my mind forever.  i have told few people my story for fear of ridicule.  after all even my mother never believed me.  upon hearing the story on the very day it happened she said, “you were just having a daydream, just playing like you were superman.  it really didn't happen.”\r\n\tbelieve me or not, here goes..........\r\n\tas i approached the light it was blindingly bright.  it was coming from the sky as far up as i could see.  it was in the shape of a spotlight wide enough to swallow me completely if i were to step into it.  my anticipation of playing on the swings ignored the light in the direct path of my goal.  running forward i ran into the light.  the light enveloped me with a brilliance so intense it was overwhelming.  i felt awestruck as well as frightened.  the light captured me like an animal in a trap.  i could move my arms but i could not escape from the light.  it held me!\r\n\tthere was an upward force on my body.  it felt like a magnet pulling on me.  i felt weightless.  looking uncomprehendingly around me, i began to rise off the ground.  the light somehow was pulling me through its corridor toward the sky.  has something gone dreadfully wrong with my mind, was i hallucinating?  no, it was actually happening.  i was rising in the air.  it was not a vivid dream.  it was genuine.  it was happening!\r\n\tlooking down i could see all of the yard then the roof of the house.  rising further i could see the block my house was in.  then i could see the entire town of commerce, all of the streets and the houses.  it was as if i were viewing the town from an airplane.  higher and higher, becoming more terrorized with each passing moment.\r\n\tout of the light i heard a voice; more like i felt the voice through every fiber of my being.  the voice reminds me of the earthquake we experienced a few months ago in november of 2011.  the earthquake is the first one i ever experienced.  it rumbled like thunder through the house, shaking the walls and vibrating the floor.  lasting only 20 seconds it left me with the feeling of an awesome power passing through the house.  i felt the earthquake in my entire body as the earth shook with the unnerving vibrations.\r\n\tas powerful as the voice felt it was a soothing voice, a calming voice.  at the time i thought it was god speaking to me.\r\n\t“do not be afraid,” the voice softly spoke.\r\n\t“why are you taking me?  where are you taking me?” i apprehensively asked.\r\n\t“to take you from the troubles to come,” the voice replied.\r\n\t“no, i don't want to go,” i answered.\r\n\t“you are chosen, we are here to take you” the voice explained.\r\n\t“i want my mom.  i do not want to go.  don't take me.  i am afraid,” i pleaded.\r\n\t“it is your choice.  we will not force you.  please consider carefully your decision.  we are here to help you escape things to come.  to show you wonders yet unseen,” they proclaimed.\r\n\t“no, send me back,” i spoke with fear.\r\n\t“take off your coat and let it drop to the earth as a sign to us you have chosen to stay with your family and this world full of its corruption.”\r\n\tquickly taking off my coat i let it fall down the tunnel of light still connecting me with my yard.  the coat drifted slowly.  when it hit the ground i found myself standing on the back porch of our house.\r\n\t“how did i get on the back porch,” i asked myself confusedly.  “what happened to the light, it was gone.”\r\n\tthe back porch was screened in and had a door leading in from the steps.  i pushed on the door to go out.  the door was locked from the inside.\r\n\t“how did i get in here if the door is locked?” i asked myself.\r\n\t“maybe through the door that leads into the kitchen.” i thought.  trying that door, it was locked too.  locked and i could not enter the house.\r\n\t“i don't understand this, how did i get on the porch with both doors locked?”\r\n\tunlocking the screen door i left the porch, went around the house past the swing set, to the front door.  i burst through the front door as white as a sheet and barely able to talk.  looking for mom to tell her what had just happened to me.\r\n\tshe was not in the living room.  moments ago she was.  she had been ironing a stack of clothes.  the clothes had all been ironed and neatly folded.  the ironing board had been put away.  the dishes were washed.  the house had been cleaned.  then i noticed it was beginning to get dark.  how could that be, it was morning.  how could all the clothes be ironed, the dishes washed, and the house cleaned.  i had just been in the house a minute ago.  where on earth did the day go?  a minute ago to me was over 9 hours of time.  i lost over 9 hours of time.  where was i?  why couldn't i remember living through the 9 hours.  just a minute had passed!\r\n\tmom was in her bedroom when i found her.  i told her about the light and the voice in the light.  how i had dropped my coat through the tunnel of light because i didn't want to leave her.  i told her how i found myself on the back porch but i had not entered the porch on my own.\r\n\tshe dismissed it as a daydream.  she said i was just playing superman.  that none of what i said had happened.  she said it was impossible.\r\n\tshe tried to reason with me.  “you could not have been gone for over 9 hours without me knowing about it.  i would have checked on you.”\r\n\tshe would have checked on me!  i had no answer for that.\r\n\t“other people would have seen the light, no one reported it but you.”\r\n\ti couldn't answer to that either.\r\n\ti had no proof.  then i remembered, “what about my coat, i'm not wearing it.  where is it?\r\n\twe walked outside by the swing set and found my coat laying on the ground where i had dropped it through the light.\r\n\t“see,” i said, “there it is!”\r\n\t“you took it off when you were playing and left it by the swing set.”\r\n\t“no, mom.  i dropped it down through the light.”\r\n\t“you were playing make believe and convinced yourself it was real.”\r\n\ti couldn't convince her.  to this very day she tells me it was just a dream.  i still have no proof.  i one hundred percent believe it happened.  i had an opportunity to go on a journey to somewhere but i blew it, i was so afraid.  i wonder what my life would have been like if i had left my coat on. \r\n\r\n     footnote:  after the day of the light i did have other encounters.

lights. i looked to the south,and a bit east,and i saw what at first looked to me like a huge fuzzy comet nucleus.It surprised me,and i remember saying to her,what the hell is that thing?I then realized that it was moving in our direction,so i ran in the house and got my cheap binoculars.I found it with my binoculars,and it was very strange.It was just a huge,greenish,misty/foggy ball heading towards us.It was going to pass directly overhead.When it got to be at about an 80 degree angle[just before overhead] to me,i could suddenly see a very small,orange-ish colored orb that seemed to be leading this much larger fuzzy ball.When it got to be about 85 degrees to me,all of a sudden i could see straight up into this fuzzy green ball,and inside of it was an object,surrounded by fog or haze,and it was giving off an intense,brilliant white light,but the light was only shining to the northeast.These objects were heading north and a little west,and when it got to be 90 degrees to me,or directly overhead,the haze or mist seemed to clear somewhat,and i was looking straight up at this thing in the center of the mist or haze.I want to say the object in the center was a large,dark sphere,and on the leading edge,but on the northeast part,it was as if there was a port or a door or something that was open,and the most brilliant and intense white light was shining out of it,but it only was shining to the northeast.I say the light was shining out of a port or a door,because the lite came out in a wedge shape,and the lite had shadow in it from the edges of whatever it was shining out of,and also,the light was casting shadow on the edges of whatever the the object was that the light was shining out of.After the object got to be at about 100 degrees[just past overhead],the thing in the center again became enshrouded and hidden again by the fog.So now,again,it looked like a comet nucleus,or a fuzzy ball.All this time,this thing appeared to be lead by this small orb in front of it.By the time it got to be around 120 degrees of me,it was getting harder to see because of the intense northern lights.But,i did observe a second small orange orb come from inside the large fuzzy ball,and slowly make its way straight towards the small,leading orb.The 2nd orb merged with the lead orb for about 10 seconds,then it slowly made its way straight back to the large fuzzy ball.After that,the object was fully immersed in the northern lights,and even through my binoculars,which i used to observe this whole event,i finally lost sight of it.During this event,the sky was clear,the object made no noise,and it moved in a straight line,from south and a little east,to north and a little west.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

boys witnessed a large ufo spotlighting a piece of mountain behind our property. we were all sitting outside eating a snack when one of the boys started yelling for everyone to come quick, that there was something in the sky. i ran around the back of the house to see a large disc/bell shaped object beaming a spotlight up and down the side of the mountain in a sweeping motion. it almost looked like it was searching for something. the bottom of the craft looked like a disc within a disc, with one part spinning clockwise and the inner part spinning in the opposite direction. the top of the craft stuck up out of the disc almost like the top of a bell. there were multiple flashing lights coming from the disc part of the craft with faint lights coming from top portion of what i thought could be windows. i was stopped dead in my tracks. i had never seen anything like what i was looking at before in my life. we couldnt look away. a few of us attempted to run towards the part of the mountain that it was spotlighting, but our counselers stopped us immediatley. it hovered in the same spot for maybe 4-5 minutes shining the beam of light from it the whole time. all of a sudden the entire sky

video with the intention of modifying the focus.  my intention was to observe the effects of increasing the size of the image over normal basic image integrity and detail.  the direction was basically west at 261° and 36° altitude when i shot 48 seconds of video.  \r\n \r\nupon review of frame by frame images, i discovered that three separate craft flew by the planet from my perspective of view.  attached are some images.                                                                                        \r\n                                                                                                                                         \r\nit was pure luck that i even saw the craft.  had i been using a normal focal point, jupiter would have been rendered to just a small bright dot and i would not have caught the images of the three craft that flew nearby in the sky.  my initial thought was that the distance of the craft from me was 2 to 3 miles.\r\n\r\nthe first craft flew in a straight line upwards to the left at a 25° angle.   the second craft did the same, but at a 50° angle.  the third craft actually came from the lower left and did some curving around the planet before continuing on upwards to the right at about a 40° angle.  clearly craft were flying around without lights that evening.\r\n\r\nafter researching it, the direction of the sightings was toward the lakewood lakes.   two of the craft appear to travel from the southern end of the lake and one from the northern side of the most westerly of the two lakes.   the lake is at a distance of 2.5 miles from me and the craft appear to be 172 yds in length, according to my calculations.   they could have been closer, or further away.  but it is the closest large lake in that area.   most of my observations have been over blue springs lake and lake jacomo.  logic tells me that this is occurring here as well.  \r\n\r\ni have seen another very large craft on two occasions over blue springs lake that was approximately 117 yds in length.  one of the dates was in a report of that sighting on november 16, 2014.  these three appear to be 47% larger.  the sighting also coincides with the fact that at least two other persons have reported seeing a “football field” sized craft in that same vicinity.  they were reported to have been seen while the individuals were walking along woods chapel road, which is also in the aerial photo of the lake.\r\n\r\ncraft #1 travelled through the screen in 14 frames, or .23 seconds.  craft #2 travelled through the screen in 16 frames, or .27 seconds.   craft #3 took 27 frames do to its extra movements, in .45 seconds.\r\n\r\nafter calculating the speed of the first craft, it appears to have been travelling at a rate of 6 miles per second, or 21,734 mph.  of course all of this is based on the estimate that the craft were in the vicinity of lakewood lakes.  if they were in reality closer, then the speed and size would drop incrementally.  conversely, if they were further away, then the speed and size would be even larger. however, the logic of the sightings being captured over the precise location of the center of the larger of the two lakes is compelling.\r\n\r\nsummary:\r\nthis may be the first observation and video capture of craft operating in the vicinity of lakewood lakes.\r\n","distance":"Over One

went to the front of the house and sat on the arm of the sofa looking out of the big bay window watching for any signs of his car pulling up into the driveway.  i was looking up at the stars as some appeared to be exceptionally bright and a little bigger than the surrounding stars. as i kept starring at them, then suddenly began to sort of drop, then one, then two, then many, many more.   they began to move in a motion that appeared to be like right out of a hollywood movie of the wwii air fights with the japanese planes.  i watched for many minutes trying to figure out what it was that i was watching.  i then realized it was too high for our planes to be doing the type of maneuvers they were making.  i wanted to go to the phone and call my parents to look out their windows and see if they could see the same thing, but it was before cordless phones were popular and my dad had to get up at 3:00 a.M. to go to work for the post office and i was afraid to wake him up as well.  i was afraid that if i left the window i'd lose sight of them, so i stayed and then, as quickly as it started, it stopped.\r\n\r\nmy heart was racing.  i thought, omg, is this the end of the world???  i recall anxiously grabbing the morning paper to see if anybody had reported the sighting, but there was absolutely nothing in the paper.  nothing on the news at all.  i called my mom the next day and told her what i saw.  she said i should have called her so she could have witnessed it too.  \r\n\r\ni have had a couple of other sightings of ufo's.  the next was up in the foothills of the sierras in calaveras county.  we were outside sitting by a camp fire watching the skies over toward the direction of area 51.  we saw many objects that were start like move quickly from east to west and from east to north west in a matter of a mili-second.  some would appear to be a single star-like shape, then would spilt into 3, then they would all fly off into different directions.\r\n\r\nthe last sighting was what i call, a giant mother-like ship that was black, like a shadow.  again in calaveras county approximately in the late 1990's.  we were all out on the hot tub deck looking outside when we saw an object flying very low, perhaps just above the tree tops.  it flew very slow, but what was so weird was it had a spot light and it was in a search like mode.  moving in a slow, sweeping motion.  it would come on, then the light would go out.  the ship moved continually forward from the north towards the south.  it flew directly over the house.  we would see its under belly.  no windows, no lights.  it looked like right out of the star wars movie.  not smooth at all.  the search light was off until it moved passed the house , then came back on looking for who knows what????  there was no wind, no sound, nothing.  it was huge.  then, it flew over the ridge and out of sight, but then in about maybe 20 minutes, we saw it again further east of us doing the same thing--search light and moving very slowly north.  we watched it fly out of sight again, never saw it again.

i believed in the paranormal/ufo phenomena. anyways, my story started off at my college (new england college) patiently waiting for my father to come get me for the weekend because i chose to dorm at school there on the weekdays and see my family on the weekends. around 6:00 p.M my father had arrived at my campus and we began our hour trip back home. the ride back home was as the same as every other time, the only difference was that it was mid november and a little chilly outside so i had felt no need to roll down any window as it was a clear evening. entering into exit 20 (which leads to laconia) we stopped by a gas station to pick up some snacks. about a minute later we got back into the car and started to drive past tilton, nh within seconds entering winnasquam/belmont, nh. sitting in the passenger seat (time being 7:43-7:45pm) i played my part as a passenger and always scoped the areas around while thoughts would run through my head non-stop. entering belmont, i felt the need and also just randomly looked up towards the north-east side of where i was sitting to observe the beauty of the night sky and the water below the bridge we were driving on when all of a sudden coming from south of where we were positioned, i noticed (probably about 1 mile above the car and a few feet in the air to my right) a object moving ninja-swift-like over the lake which eventually i ended up losing sight of it over some trees to the left of the car which was miles of woods if you were to even try and get a chance to chase it. i noticed when it came into my view that this \"flying mechanism\" was not a helicopter nor a plane because i debunked them off the theory because no such plane or helicopter would have moved silently so low towards the earth and the fact that i only had about 4 seconds to get as much scoping out of the object as i could, i was able to make out some characteristics which eventually gave me an idea of what i might have been looking at considering how swift and silent this object was traveling and 4 lights from the bottom that i saw. the lights that i saw from the bottom of the object is what made me later go home and sketch out a triangular probably about 30-40 feet in diameter and the positioning of the lights from when i was observing it from the car it made me immediately decode that this object was definitely a triangular knife-like machine just moving swiftly like a steak knife cutting thru butter in the air. the strange thing was that at the moment of the sighting, i felt like i was paralyzed, shocked-in-aw during the observation and that i was debating to myself what i was seeing and after what i saw. i could not believe what i had seen neither could i convince myself that i might of just had my own experience. here in nh there's no one to run to and tell the story to with out telling yourself to think twice about what your gonna say and that mufon was the only thing i could turn to and possibly not sound crazy. the sighting does not surprise me at all as nh is famous for ufo sightings and abductions. i don't know if any other vehicles in front of me or behind spotted it as well but all i know is i know what i saw, and what i saw believe it or not was proof that we really are not alone. seriously though, billions of galaxy's and people think there is no one else.. you would be an idiot and crazy to try and convince yourself that. that is my experience and thank you for letting me come out with it with out feeling like a lunatic, even tho either way i still do feel like one just talking about it.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

smoke a cigarette outside of my house.  i looked up at the sky and noticed eight large amber colored spherical lights about the size of a full moon directly above my house.  they were at cloud level so approximately 500-1000 feet up and stayed stationary for approximately 90 minutes.  they did not move but they did fade in and out so that some lights would go dark while others stayed lit.  this continued periodically and at times they would all remain lit until after about 90 minutes there was only one light that remained lit and it drifted north into the horizon until we could no longer see it.  the light that drifted north did not move at a rapid speed, i would estimate that it moved about 200 miles/hour similar to an airplane.  \r\n\r\nwe live under a main flight path in san diego and i saw several airplanes and helicopters fly by the area but there seemed to be no change of path for the aircraft due to the lights. i took several photos and videos on my digital camera of the lights but after the event when i went inside to view them the camera was dead even though i still had a 75% full battery while taking the photos. there was only one photo that remained on my phone but only one small light showed on the picture.  when i zoomed in on the light it seemed to have a mushroom shape but the image was too fuzzy to tell what it was.  i have seen chinese lanterns and these were definitely not them since they stayed stationary for 90 minutes despite a 10-15 mph westerly wind, they also weren't flares since there was no smoke eminating and they did not drop in elevation.  i have no idea what they were but i have never seen anything like them since.  i was not scared of the objects, they almost seemed to give me a sense of peace. \r\n\r\nthe next day i spoke to a friend
