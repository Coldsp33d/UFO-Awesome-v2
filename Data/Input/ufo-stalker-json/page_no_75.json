visit to a neighbor. i was 14.  it was night and it was winter. all of a sudden i just became aware of a massive deep sound like a sine wave going up down up in pitch. i looked around and saw nothing. then i leaned forward and looked up from the front seat. hovering above me was a craft. i got out of the car, excited but also intimidated. i stood between the open door of the car, one hand on the car and one on the door. in the air directly above me was a large bright laser red orb, about the size of a small house, about 100 ft up in the air. orbiting around it was the same bright red light which looked just like radar - it circled the orb, then there would be a fraction of a second when there was a gap, then it blipped on again and orbited around again. just like how radar looks on the screen. no wind. no exhaust. and though the sound was massive it didn’t hurt my ears or rumble my intestines. also, this was a heavily populated suburban tract and although the sound was huge, no one was running out of their houses to see what was going on. my mom and sister had finished their visit and came outside and started yelling excitedly. her friends followed her out. all loudly responding to this thing. this happened in a matter of minutes. then it took off straight up to a very distant height and from my perspective it was now small as my fingernail. in just seconds it went that high. it hovered way up there for a few seconds, then flew down into the distance and i couldn’t see anything because it was below the level of the houses. then a few seconds later it took off at a specific angle, like 45 degrees, and moving at tremendous speed it climbed into the sky using the entire expanse from my view, until it was up and out of sight. there were multiple jets in the sky at the time and they looked like they were moving as fast as tricycles compared to this thing. we lived near a naval air base. the brightness of this craft was glowing so that it only looked like light, similar to a lightbulb, where you can see the glow but not the glass. \r\ni was directly below it with a belly up view and that is how i know the orbiting thing wasn’t a single entity but a radar type energy orbiting dizzyingly fast around the orb. \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

noticed my friend is not here yet und looked into the sky to the west and saw that very bright object in the sky. it was like surrounded by light. i think it was like something could control the light, its hard to explain. in the center of the object there was a deep red. i cant tell you which shape the object (circle, egg or something else) because it was very hard to watch but i think its like a circle. i think it went very slowly to the earth. i thought i was dreaming because it was so abnormal i never had such a experience i thought im maybe becomming crazy or something. then i decided to turn off the engine of my car. then i looked back to the object i still could see it for few seconds then it disappeared out of nothing. \r\n\r\nwhen i turned off the engine i noticed a noise like a \"zummm\". like a high voltage is in the air (hard to explain for me) or an electric car is accelerating very intensive. but i cant tell you if its really from the object but i can tell you for sure that i never heard something like this before. the reason maybe why i didnt noticed it earlier is because my engine is very loud. \r\n\r\nmy friend came after like 5 minutes. i asked him

new house.  at 2:37 pm, i was driving back to their old house to pick up the next load, when i noticed a stationary black object in the sky above the tree line in front of my car.  the jet black object caught my eye because it stuck out conspicuously against the crisp blue sky.  i immediately realized it was something out of the ordinary.  excited and perplexed, i stopped the car and fumbled to get my phone out to capture it on video.  \r\n\r\nthe object hovered silently and motionless in the sky.  it appeared to ascend slightly and very slowly at one point.  otherwise, it did not move at all.  (a close review of the video suggests it also may have rotated along its vertical axis, like a spinning top, but i did not see any rotation while watching it with my own eyes).  it made no sound.  it was shaped like an upside-down cone or pyramid.  it had a distinct, sharp outline against the sky.  it looked dense, heavy and sturdy, and not made of flimsy or lightweight materials.  it definitely was not a natural object (e.G., a cloud or bird).  it looked mechanical, like some sort of machine.  but it did not have any discernable features of an aircraft (e.G., wings, propellers or a tail) or anything else that can fly.  it had no visible propulsion system or other means of flight.  it appeared shiny and shimmered somewhat, which i believe was sunlight reflecting off its surface.  otherwise, it did not emit any light.\r\n\r\ni asked a family member driving behind me if he saw the object (he did) and knew what it was (he did not).  he was not as interested in the object as i was and drove away.  after filming for about a minute, i also drove away because we were on a tight schedule.  i continued to watch the object as i drove and realized it was much higher up and farther away—and therefore much bigger—than i initially thought.  \r\n\r\ni recorded three videos.  the first one at 2:37 p.M. is through my windshield and, unfortunately, does not keep the object in the frame very well.  i captured the second video through my open window at 2:38 p.M., a few hundred yards down the road.  i stopped again about a quarter mile farther down the road to record the third video at 2:39 p.M.  after that, i continued to look at the object while driving but lost sight of it around 2:42 p.M., when trees along the road obscured my view of the sky.  the last time i saw the object, it was still hovering in the same spot where i first noticed it. \r\n\r\ni have speculated that the object could have been a balloon, a kite or a drone.  i ruled out the first two options mainly because it did not behave—e.G., sway, pitch or pivot—like something that was tethered to the ground while flying.  although a drone is the most plausible explanation, i do not think this was a drone.  the object was too high (~300-1000 ft.) and too large (~5-20 ft. tall) to be a drone, at least one available to the public.  it was also too motionless, for too long.  it did not drift or tilt in the wind; it simply did not move.  even an experienced drone pilot probably cannot keep one completely still for several minutes in outdoor conditions.  \r\n\r\ni do not contend that the object i saw was (or was not) extraterrestrial.  i honestly do not know what it was or where it came from.  but i definitely saw something—a tangible object—in the sky that i cannot identify or explain.

(the moon is out of focus in the background).  im sending you the original plus one i was able to clean up a bit. you have to zoom 1000x to see it on the original but the second one is already zoomed at that power. these are in the sky on a nightly basis, have been for years now. i think you will find it as interesting as i. i mean, its obvious we're not alone. why wont they admit it. we could learn so much. a total waste of humanities time. thanks for listening, hope this helps somehow, you guys do great work. sincerly: brian m. crinion mesa az.

brought my girlfriend home. the weather was pretty good that afternoon, so i decided to walk back home. on maybe the half of the way i noticed something in the air. i thought it was a drone or something like that. it clearly wasn´t. it was a lightball, which made weird moves. it flied zig-zag, then straight up, i think it rotated also around itself. i wanted to take a photo, so i put out my smartphone and filmed it. suddenly, my phone, which was nearly full charged some minutes before, run out of batterie. i tried to follow the light ball. just after some minutes chasing the object, i noticed it´s getting really hot. i thought it was just because i was running, but even the grass beneath the paths that i was crossing dried and the color changed from dark green to a brownish yellow. after some minutes, the object got down behind a large wall of a factory. i runned around, what has taken me something like a minute or two. at the other side, i saw a brown spot on the ground, where the grass definately was burned away. the area was surrounded by smoking hot dirt and dried grass. it looked like there was an impact, but i didn´t hear anything. i wanted to take a picture of the spot, but the phone didn´t start. i felt more and more uncomfortable, as the sunlight got weaker and weaker. i decieded to run home. when i arrived, i turned on my phone, and it worked like there wasn´t anything. i still felt the heat in the air. since this happened, i can´t sleep anymore like i did before. i´ve never been at this area again. i didn´t know this website before. that´s why there´s so much time between the event and the report. i just told a friend about this and he told me that i can report what happened. i think he doesn´t believe me.\r\n\r\ni´m not sure if the time is
