(after measuring on a map of gross rez they were about 1000ft away from me) my mind could not categorize the objects, first i thought they were birds because the were moving about the same speed, maybe 15-20 mph. they were flying about 5 feet from the surface. they were flying in formation 15 ft apart from each other.  as the got closer the buzzing sound got louder. this portion of the event lasted about 20 seconds. they were moving around a corner of the lake towards me, it seemed like they may have noticed us and immediately accelerated and flew over the nearest mountain and low elevation in a matter of a second or two. they made a sound like a jet flying very fast after the acceleration. unfortunately, my friends never saw the objects as he was around the corner but heard them coming and leave after they accelerated. \r\n  my main impression of the two objects was the fact that they did not have a surface, they radiated black light similar to a star bu in reverse. the centers had a white light but not very bright. the edges were very \"wavery\". i closest thing i can compare them to are ghosts, (long story but relevant at the time of sighting, (im not crazy, ive just had some strange experiences in my life)) \r\n   i am reporting this now because of a report i found on the mufon map that sounded very similar in the same location. case #40732. it is my belief that these objects were probably military as they made a sound unlike most ufo sightings.

(can’t remember make & model – but that doesn’t really matter). i sat in the front passenger seat as we left the station about 2 a.M. and s.D. was driving us back to campus.\r\nthe drive to/from uwf’s campus from wsre is about a 10-15 minute drive, and you have to get on university parkway, which is a straight shot for several (under 3) miles, right to campus.\r\nthere are small rolling hills along this road and we noticed what appeared to be car headlights ahead. but the weird thing was that every time we took a dip down one of the hills, they wouldn’t disappear, and they were seemingly in the same spot at the crests…. like the ‘car’ wasn’t moving toward us. we continued toward campus wondering aloud about this. \r\ndriving toward uwf, university parkway is wide and dead-ends on campus blvd. it is a large, wide intersection. when we arrived at the intersection, we saw that the lights were not from a car, but a craft hovering above the pine trees just in the back of the corner gas station (i think it was also a 7-11 type place, but it closed shortly after this episode and isn’t there any more.)\r\nof course this was an amazing thing to see, and s.D. stopped the car in the intersection, as we both looked up at this triangular-shaped craft. he was scared speechless, i was completely fascinated. i opened the car door and s.D. started yelling “don’t get out!”\r\nbut i was awestruck and wanted to get closer. but the moment my foot hit the ground the ufo took off at high speed to my right, into the night sky, at a 45-degree angle. it seemed to know the second i was there, and it’s “headlights” turned off the same moment it took off. it was totally silent. no whirring or engine noise at all, it didn’t need to accelerate; it just took off and was out of sight in a second or two. this was not technology we had then, or now. \r\ni know pensacola has been a hot spot for ufo sightings over the years, and many people brush if off due to the close-by military base(s). but i was close to this thing. maybe 120 feet away, as it hovered over a pine tree that was perhaps 50 feet tall. and i had eyes on it (it’s “headlights”) for about 8 minutes.\r\ns.D. wouldn’t talk about it. not then or the day after, as i described the incident to a couple of professors in the communication arts department. he couldn’t (or wouldn’t) utter a word about it. i don’t know if he blocked it or remembers it. last i heard he was living in miami. but he would never speak about it, not even to me. \r\nover the years i have only mentioned this incident to a handful of very close people. the response i got from my professors (mostly sneers and laughter) was enough for me to keep silent all these years.\r\ni never felt fear or threatened. when people mention those feelings during an encounter, or describe abductions, it makes me believe that there are at least two type of aliens. one that is benevolent. and one that is not. i felt this encounter was with a ‘benevolent’ type. and if not aliens, perhaps beings from another dimension…. or even “us” in the far future, time-traveling backwards. i don’t know “who” i saw. but i am definitive about what i saw.\r\ni am by no means an artist, but can describe it. the craft was triangular in shape. maybe 40 feet in diameter(?). the shape of the triangle wasn’t with hard pointed corners, but the corners were “soft” or somewhat rounded. it appeared silvery metallic on top. underneath, it would be hard to know the color, because there were bright lights on the bottom, all around the bottom edge. strangely, i don’t remember that these lights put out much of a glow much beyond the craft. in other words, it wasn’t illuminating the ground. and if memory serves, they weren’t really white, but a variety of blues and greens. the “headlights” on top were a bit wider apart than a standard car’s would be. i clearly remember having that thought as i stood there, (having initially thought this was a car on the distance.) i was close to it (in the stationary car) for about 10 seconds before i got out of the car and it flew away.\r\n","distance":"101-500

lake.  i took two random videos in hopes of catching something.  the first video taken at 3:09 p.M. lasted 13 seconds but i have not noticed anything on it.  the second video taken at 6:41 p.M. lasted 34 seconds.  at first i didn’t see anything… but then i was amazed at how many moving craft there were.  the direction was 342°, at an elevation of 17° from the horizon.  \r\n\r\nthe image of frame 0:17 contains 101 craft.  in frame 0:21 there are 139 craft.  this means that in 4/60th of a second later 38 more had appeared.\r\n\r\nthe photomerged image of frames 0:17 and 0:21 has had most of the color removed to facilitate seeing the dots.  since they were faint to begin with, i artificially placed a fine marker dot over each craft to make them more visible.   the darker of the dots in this image are from frame 0:21 as it was layered over the first one.  thus one can see the amount of change in that time as well.\r\n\r\nin a matter of only 4/30th of a second, 38 more craft were in the view of the camera, or nearly 40% more.  most of them seem to be heading in their own patterns as there is no consistent direction.  some seem to remain close together, yet others seem to be more independent.  \r\n\r\nthere were some craft which were obviously larger but fainter and more blurred to see.  frame 6:54 after some enhancement allows one to see the image somewhat better.  however i cropped and greatly edited it to reveal a triangular component to it.  \r\n\r\nframe 6:55, or 1/60th of a second later showed yet another larger craft.  further editing shows it to be perhaps of the same nature as the previous one, but from a different view.\r\n\r\nfinally, frame 14:06 depicts two of the smaller craft in the swarm but which were more readily visible.  while they show up mainly as an elongated dot, and a dot, they nonetheless were elements of the swarm.\r\n    \r\nthe hundreds of craft in the video at times seemed to behave like a swarm of instects.  however when analyzed they show no elements of insects.  the focal point of the 300 mm telephoto lens was on infinity, and so what was captured on the film would have been actually covering a distance of 1,024 ft vertical height in the image, at a distance of about 1 mile estimated.  if the distance is accurate, this means that individual craft average about 7.2 feet in diameter.  some were larger, some were smaller.  the larger craft of frames 6:54 and 6:55 would have been approximately 36 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nthis is a new development in the observations.  while there have been sometimes multiple craft in video images, this is the first time that this observer has seen so many over blue springs lake, in the hundreds.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

dimmed and disappeared in the distance.\r\n\r\nthis object could have been seen crossing high above i40 traveling in either direction around the mount juliet, tn area around 10:40 or so last night.

no blinking or additional lights like an aircraft would have and it made no sound. i looked around the visible sky to see if any other objects or aircraft might be around and realized that nothing else was flying at the moment. i ran inside and woke my wife to come and witness and observe it. she watched for a minute, maybe two. i then watched it turn from the swirling cloud to what appeared to be a fanned out illuminated cloud in front of it. it became very fuzzy/hazy as it moved farther away. the path was from south to north and slightly west. the whole viewing lasted about 10 minutes from start to finish. just after the object went out of sight, the sky fillied up with about a half a dozen or so aircraft. some were commercial aircraft flying into bwi. one massive aircraft flew from south to north at about 25 degrees above horizon along the bay and then headed due east towards deleware.\r\n so i have no idea what this object could of been. i watch aircraft an satellites all the

and these were not planes or helicopters. i do not know what they were but they were off in the distance. i was shocked, panicky, and my daughter told me to make sure i locked the back door ( which we never do because we have 3 pit bulls and it's highly unlikely that anyone would break in due to that)\r\nshe's pregnant and she got weirded out. \r\ni don't know how to explain it it its a feeling like you got a stalker and your being watched. my dogs over last 6 months have been barking at backyard while in the house usually only in evenings or middle of night they'll wake me up barking as my bedroom faces the backyard. i've heard noises out there late at night like banging metal, someone out there but every time i check it stops and doesn't happen again and the dogs run around the yard line they are looking for someone. could be nothing, maybe another animal is what i thought, but as i'm typing this i started thinking about it making it good for, in my opinion, an honorable mention.\r\ni'm not crazy and i don't tell whoppers, i just really honestly don't know what it was.\r\ni have an iphone 6 if you can tell me how to restore the video i deleted, i will and maybe you can get it to work.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:20:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

appeared on the west horizon traveling east. while observing the plane, our attention was turned to an object around 40 degrees above the treeline. i noticed the object in stark contrast against the light blue sky and a jet contrail.  the object can only be described as a black star, which began to pulsate dark grey \"light\", as if it had a back light behind it. the center was total black with irregular edges that were masked by the glow. while using other planes and scattered clouds as a reference point, the altitude seemed extremely high or perhaps even out of orbit. the size of the object was very difficult to estimate due to the glowing effect it had. if you placed a number 2 pencil at arms length against the sky, the eraser would be the same size roughly as the object.\r\n\r\nafter several minutes of observing, the object remained stationary and appeared to twinkle, and took on the shape of a sombrero hat. despite the object appearing as though it was very far away, we both felt threatened and watched during this time.  the object shifted to the southwest after 5-8 minutes of observation and began to slowly fade until it disappeared entirely.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The memories of my childhood and teens began to return in my late 20’s, when long black dreams (where i was in a mist or floating trying to reach for something), began to clear so that i could see the places where my mother had taken me, and the people that called to the elders by means of a sing-song chant. with this chant a portal would open in a wall and an elder would step through.\r\nthe first time i met an elder i was five years old, the two years prior the women-with some older girls eight to ten years old-had been training/teaching me to trust and do whatever the elders told me to do. the main symbol they used you had to look at until the parts began to swirl. you would enter that swirling vision, floating, with your every sense alive. then they would touch you and their thoughts became one with yours. they-women or girls-never spoke, only with their touch did you hear their thoughts. i have never felt the power they transferred to me, when we touched, in any other human, nor the knowledge; both would fade after leaving them.\r\nthe elder never came through the portal, but motioned for me to come to him. all i could see was a big black robed figure. the woman holding my hand thought to me that this was to be my elder and that i needed to trust and obey all he told me to do, without pause or question. something a five year old, who has been waiting for this moment, was easy and willing to do. i let go and stepped through.\r\nit was as if i was walking on air. i could move but i felt no pressure of up, down, front, back or sideways. it was as if i had become part of everything. he again extended his sleeve. i reach up into it and we merged. it was as if i no longer had a hand, but flowed with his thoughts and all the power and knowledge of the universe was mine for the asking.\r\n  as we began to travel, his thoughts (soothingly) began to flow into my mind, to let me know that to pass this test i needed to remember to focus on the symbol as i had been taught, to the point in which nothing that touched me would be felt or responded to. the travel was breath taking in itself, as we were traveling through the stars without a ship. the universe was ours alone.\r\nas we traveled, he motioned and thought, “we go there.” i saw four stars, everything seemed to move even faster and then i was in a dimly lit room. it was warmer than being in space, like the first warm day in spring.\r\nwe waited awhile, and then we moved forward into a room i had not seen there. there was a glass domed chamber table that had glass tubes running into it. i found myself lying on the table (for the first time i heard his thoughts without being touched), “all is well, look up and see our symbol, remember what you have been taught, be in the mist for i will be there for you.”\r\nall our training was done in the nude. this was so every part of our bodies could be in touch with the universe. i traveled there nude and lay there nude. \r\ni looked up at our symbol until it began to spin and become a spreading whitish gray mist. he was there, a part of the mist, surrounding me, comforting me on my trust in him. then he said i had passed and must return to my body.\r\ni was no longer in the chamber. my elder motioned for me to follow. i could not see where we were going, but he spoke to my mind that we would be watching all the remaining children as they took their test.\r\nwithout feeling it we had traveled upward. there were some other children there; the place was dark except for the dim light below from the glass chamber. we were not allowed to touch or speak to each other (this was the second test), only watch to see if the other children would pass the first test and join us. there had to more than one chamber. we watched as one child after another appeared in the chamber. they had to remain motionless as either rats or snakes entered and left the chamber. it amazed me that i had never felt them. then a child moved, instantly the snakes struck. there was no more need to see if others passed, the lesson was learned, to fail was to die. yes, i am terrified of things that wiggle or scamper across the floor.\r\n i have not remembered the travel back, only arriving back and stepping back through the portal, with calming words that said, “when you risk everything, as you must, sometimes you die in the process. the rest must go on for the greater good.”\r\nthe woman was there and she touched me, instantly all i seen and done passed to her. she thought, “you have done well. your elder is well pleased. you will begin a study to strengthen what you have already learned.\r\nwhat i did not understand at the time was that little if any time had passed from the time i entered the portal until i left it.\r\n\r\nwhat brought more of these memories back was an event in my early 30’s while at ft leavenworth. it was a hot summer day, when a voice behind me said one of the sing-song chants. my sweat felt like ice on my skin, but i was not cold. i turned to see a major standing there with a smirk of a smile. nothing was moving around us, we had stepped out of time into another dimension. he never spoke, but i heard every one of his thoughts to me, “we have always known where you were, what you were doing; you will always be one of us” (my parent’s divorced when i was six and my father had custody for several years). that night by an old tree i saw a portal, but i had learned to fear and could not step through.\r\nthere is more to the story, but i do not want to bore you. as i hoped earlier, i would like to talk to those you know that would be interested and hopefully could answer some of my questions. i have known since i was a child “we are not alone”. but those few i have found, on the net, have seemed to be like those who claim you are crazy or demon possessed. i would like to meet people like you who look at it all logically, not judging, but observing our history as a whole.\r\nthank you for your time. i hope to hear from you.","distance":"20 Feet or

one of my sons was in front of me.  he suddenly looks up and says look.\r\nit was a huge craft, moving very slowly and completely silent. no noise whatsoever...Nothing. it was only a few hundred feet over us, if that.  our back of the house is very dark. there was no moon. the only reason we saw it was because it had 2 rows of a blue or grey light that illuminated parts of it and remained constant throughout.  it's underside was so black that without those lights it would have been unnoticed. the detail i observed was that it looked like an old rr trestle, a black metal with huge inlaid bolts. i also noticed the paint or covering of it looked worn off or stripped away in parts, revealing almost a rust color.\r\nit continued on it's course, sw away from raritan bay which is about 1 mile from our residence, it looked either triangular or shaped like an arrowhead. it was moving so slowly i actually ran with it, off our porch into the backyard grass to try and observe more detail. it eventually went out of sight.\r\n\r\nmy son justin and i were amazed and started comparing notes, about 5 minutes later we either saw another one or that one had doubled back but way off in the distance, to our east.  it was banking to head out over the atlantic ocean.  again, completely silent and this one looked more triangular.  again, the only reason we saw it was because of the two rows of lights along the perimeter.  this one was moving faster than the first, like an airliner, but not very fast.\r\nwe live in close proximity to earle naval weapons handling station where several naval vessels occasionally resupply.\r\n\r\nwhat was most eventful to me was the size, it's very slow speed and the complete, utter silence....\r\n\r\ni did meekly call our local police station and
