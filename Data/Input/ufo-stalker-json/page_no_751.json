or better. i asked him to look at the western and northern sky and i would watch the southern and eastern sky. he said okay but if we don't see anything in ten minutes i'm out of here. i said okay that's fair so we started scanning the sky. five seconds later i hear him shout \"look man,look\". for a couple seconds i thought he was just messing with me but there seemed to be an urgency in his voice. i look over and he is pointing back toward the west. i had to look down his arm to spot them but there they were 3 of them flying single file one closely behind the other. i told him i see them. as they got closer about 5 seconds later they went from single file to a triangular fighter formation so fast if you would have blinked you would have missed it. now they are almost directly overhead and i would estimate their altitude as 500 to 1000 ft. and their airspeed at 400 mph. we could see the underside of each craft. there was an oval hole in the middle of each oval saucer or disc and outward from that there were slots very similar to looking at a hunter ceiling fan motor housing with the slots to let the heat out. they then made a graceful elbow type turn while flying just inches apart. it was as if one mind was controlling all three disc. as they continued north we were losing sight of the belly of the craft. they each had an erie orange type glow about them. i would surmise about 24 hours later the glow was a reflection off of their craft from the amber colored sodium street lights on danieldale blvd. as they got further away they just looked like 3 bright stars then the most incredible thing happened. the craft in the back left position broke formation with a path that looked like a c then stopped at the top of the c and immediately re traced it's path back down the c and back into fighter formation. it gained about 3000 ft. in altitude and came back in about 4 seconds while also traveling forward at about 400 mph. it was the most awesome acrobatic maneuver i have ever seen. i don't think there is any way a human being could have withstood that kind of a g force. we now lose sight of them and look at each other and i said to my stepson \"do you know what we just saw\"? he said yeah we just saw 3 extraterrestrial space ships. a couple of seconds later we both hit the deck because an fa-18 hornet flys right over the top of us heading east. the engine noise from those 2 engines shook the ground. then we see another jet coming from the southwest then a third hornet from the west. they join up and start flying south. my stepson and i both said in stereo \"hey you are going the wrong way then suddenly they all 3 turn north and light their afterburners. the fire coming out of those engines were longer than the jets themselves. they motor scootered out of there very fast and we lost sight but about 10 seconds later there was a huge explosion that bowed my window glass inward about an inch and it flexed back without breaking. you could also feel this explosion on your feet. i knew right away they had gone supersonic and broke the sound barrier trying to catch these saucers. they hardly ever do that over populated areas. we decided to go back in and watch the 10 pm news to see if anyone else may have reported seeing the same thing we saw. we were watching channel 4 (fox)news and at about 10:22 or so the anchor clarice tinsley says they have had hundreds of calls about a large explosion in southwest dallas county. she said a live truck is on scene and jeff crilley will give us a report after we come back from commercial break. they come back and jeff is standing in front of a wrought iron gate that said something munitions plant. he says we think there has been an underground explosion here at the plant but we can't get anyone to comment on this developing story. then clarice tinsley says well that's it for this broadcast and if it warrants we will interrupt regular programming to give an up date. nothing more was reported on that night and there was absolutely nothing about this in the newspaper the next morning. hensley field (grand prairie naval base) was still operational at that time and we think that is where the fa-18 hornets came from. it's been a little more than twenty years since this happened and it still blows me away. for weeks after this happened it was like a movie reel playing over and over again. it was hard to focus on anythng and finally i said hey you have to let this go or you will go mad. so i deal with it an go about my life knowing without a doubt they is extraterrestrial life out there and if i had to guess how much farther ahead of our technology they are i would say hundreds of thousands of years if not more.","distance":"101-500

or 19 at the time. date and time is approximate. but i do know it must have been after i turned eighteen as the clubs back then and the legal age for alcohol consumption was eighteen. the event itself is as clear as day. but as the years have passed i have kept this incident for the most part to myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nin the late evening hour at or around 9:30-10:30 p.M. (time is approximate)in 1984 or 85 while a friend drove both he and i from central maui to west maui to go to what was then the hottest night club at one of the resorts. as usual we were both excited to get there as most teenagers are.  but on this particular night i noticed on the mountainside above the highway near and past the maalaea  boat harbor along the coast a singular green light hovering. my first thought was that it couldn't have been a helicopter because it was a green ball of light and to be hovering above the ground without a spotlight would be dangerous as there are power lines in certain areas. the highway itself has numerous turns and the visibility towards the mountainside is intermittent. but as the passenger i focused my attention on the green light. it hovered for what seemed like minutes until i lost sight of it.  but as we drove on, i noticed upon one of the turns while looking in the opposite direction at the coast that there was a series of green lights or orbs in a straight line much like what one would see on an airport landing strip at night in the water heading in the direction of the island of kahoolawe. i am not certain of the amount but there appeared to be at least 6 to 8 and as the one furthest out glowed bright, the one nearest the shore seem to fade as it moved. as we kept driving now out of sight and view of the lights in the water i remained with my entire body turned to the back of the car looking through the rear window to try and see anything but at that point we had gone past the point of seeing that far back.\r\n\r\nmy friend was asking me what i was looking at then i asked if he had seen  the lights both on the mountainside and in the water, he said he didn't. he thought i imagined the whole thing or made it up and didn't take it seriously. we went on to our destination.  years later after he moved to the mainland and married and then returned home for a visit i asked him again if he remembers seeing those lights, he said he didn't. he asked if i was serious after all these years. i know i wasn't imagining it as that memory comes back to me every so often in a dream or even when driving along that very coastline.\r\n\r\ni had once seen an televised episode of uso's a year ago or so and it was just like reliving what i had seen so many years ago down to the green lights used in the episode. yet i still remained silent.  but it was only until a hangar 1 episode that talked about the reasons why so many sightings go unreported that i finally realized that there was no shame to reveal and share my experience to get answers in hopes that perhaps others may have witnessed the same thing. i know i'm not crazy and to the very core of my being i know i saw something that night whether it can or can't be explained.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":66926,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":20.8980211,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06222015-0046","longitude":-156.5025622,"occurred":458524800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Hawaii","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1435009234000,"summary":"Ufo/uso sighting in maui, hawaii","tags":["ufo","uso"],"timeZone":"HST","timeZoneName":"HST","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":11301,"locationName":"Wailuku, Hawaii","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:24817"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Washington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When i checked something on my security system i noticed a brigth white orb flying behind a tree. the object is a steady white light emitting orb only seen in the corner.

of my life, i would be writing basically a book lol..In short last summer, i fell sleep on the living room couch, was awoken to a tiny blue light floating around my eyes, dunno why, but i felt compelled & immediately threw on the blanket around my shoulders, & went to go look up outside at the sky. i proceded to do so for the next 2 nights, what follows is 100% the truth & i still can't comprehend what has been happening to me since then. i witnessed tiny white orbs of light dancing around the night sky, & i then saw huge orbs of orange lights, totally silence, hover still in the night sky. then after about 5 mins of this, the objects began to what i originally thought was the lights dimmng out like a carosine lantern, it wasn't til the 3rd orange orb did this, that i realized these things weren't dimming out, but shooting up skyward, totally silent, at an inconceivable rate of speed. few things to note at this time, when i say orbs of light, i mean these things weren't using lights off the craft, but it was more like whatever these objects were, they were omitting a bright burning look like a torch, or that orange that appears in metal after its heated at a certain tempature.Also note , when i tried using my smart phone camera, the phone went black, fully charged battery at the time, phone just had a black screen, & wouldnt work or do anything, never happened before, only happens when these objects are around. when these objects returned a few nights later, these objects when banking on a turn, looked like an orange donut on fire. the objects were huuuge! no noise, whatsoever. infact in my footage besides my gravy breathing, & the crickets in the background, not a sound!! i leave about 14 miles out from o'hare airport, i know what planes look like & sound like, same with helicopters, & rc drones that are becoming more popular.Wasn't anything like that, in fact i went back a few weeks later & filmed everything in the sky for comparison. i have kept this information, along with my footage to myself, with the exception of a few family members & friends. i thought i was going crazy, with what i was seeing, & it never happened when anyone else was around, or i would see it, go run in the house to get my family, & it would be gone. almost felt like it was toying with me, no jk. funny thing is everybody i was trying to talk about my experiences of that first night, along with my sightings in the night sky, & i was told its planes, chinese lanterns, etc. it wasn't til the fleet/parade i call it, when one after another came over the night sky, & the orange orbs, would come over the north eastern horizon, & began to proceed across the night sky, reach a point, the orb would stop, wait for the following one directly behind it, they would stop, in mid air mind you, wait for next, & form perfect triangles spaced out evenly from each other, & then they would fly off in 3s, always 3s, in perfect triangles, or 3 in a row stacked on top of each other, & then fly off over the horizon.Simply breathtaking, my dad joked & said it was like my own small version of close encounters of the 4th kind, i asked him, what that was, because i never heard of it! lol, now i do!  i also would like to interject at this time, this was all last summer, & it is beginning to happen again, only im not exaggerating when i say, almost every other time, i go look up & the night sky, i am seeing these objects..Since my \"awakening\" as i call it, last summer, i always look up, & i was a believer in life on other planets, & throughout the universe, & i absolutely love astrology, but that was as far as it went. but now, i feel as crazy as this sounds, a pulling, a yearning for more..In short, as of yesterday, & what i witnessed at 4:30am this morning, i feel compelled for more answers, & i would appreciate it if i could talk to someone & perhaps have someone local come see this for themselves, i assure you, its worth your

at all. they stayed about 50 yards away and circled us, there was about 3 of them. this went on for about 10 minutes then a white orb lit up about 20 feet over us and zipped off about 20 feet and disappeared. after that my brother got freaked out went back to the house and that's when he saw a black ape like creature looking at us. he started yelling at me and that's when it took off into the

above the craft. it had a very domed lite under it, that actually was a magnify lite.When i looked to the left of the craft ,i could see a rock formation that we played in. about one mile from the house. i could see the holes that we crawled out of.The craft had port holes on the top of it. they were maned by the grey beings, who pointed at me and my grand mother, and summed a taller one to the window. he shrugged it off as not to worry about us. i looked to the right of the craft, at a tree, and saw a slight movement in it. there was a squirrel that lived in a knot hole facing the craft.It took off through the branches. then the craft took off to the north into space.The next day the local news paper, reported there was ball lighting ,spotted the night before.I knew no one would believe

moving north-west and looked like it gained altitude. it white light with no strobing lights or red lights. it did not appear to be a plane. it appeared to gain altitude and as it left atmosphere its appearance was like that of a satellite observed with the naked eye. very faint and difficult to see. i observed the faint light as it continued to move in the trajectory. until i could not see it anymore.\r\n\r\ni feel like it was strange behavior, never saw anything like this. i have previously seen objects that were like asteroids pass in and out of the atmosphere, but this was different as it was at too low an elevation in origination.\r\n\r\nmy first thoughts were that this was actually a satellite launch, although i cannot find any documentation saying a launch took place.\r\n\r\nalso present in the sky were 2 aircraft, one was on a similar path but stayed at its altitude and was minutes behind the objects original altitude from observational origin. another was towards the west.\r\n\r\nafter i could no longer see the ufo a meteorite came from the east to west and was moving much faster than the ufo in comparison. the ufo had a speed similar to an airplane although it was heading out of the atmosphere and could have been faster than observation point would allow discernment.\r\n\r\ni decided to post this for reference to anyone who may be able to do something with this data. at no point did either airplane seem to be near the ufo although my first impression was that the airplane on a similar path was following the object as it left.","distance":"Over One
