(ex)patt was with me. as we were traveling in the new mexico desert at about 4am we had just drove down off a hill and was on the valley floor when i noticed 2 orbs in my rear view mirror coming off the mtn.They appeared to be about the size of a softball,one a little larger than the other,pulsating.I first thought they were motor cycle headlights.Within seconds they were larger than basketballs and right on my bumper. i was in awe about their speed and told patt to look behind us to see if she could figure out what they were. at about the same time one on them went to the right side of the car and traveled alongside our car about 20 feet away at the same speed. i then thought maybe it was a train or something like that.There was no noise at all.As the one was traveling alongside the other one moved from the rear of the car up the trunk and  onto the top of our car a few feet above the roof and the car then had a luminescence inside, a yellowish color.I then started to smell an odor like burning coated wire. then the generator light came on and the engine shut off. by now patt was getting real scared as we sat there confused as to what was going on. i decided to get out of the car as patt was yelling at me to stay in the car. i got out and stood up looking at the object a few feet over my head. they were no longer pulsating and making no noise.I don't know how long i stood and do not remember getting back into the car. the next thing i do remember is sitting in the driver seat and looking out the widow to my right and seeing the two objects hovering above the valley floor stationary. they both then took off in a swaying pattern and within seconds were ascending high into the mtn range and were gone. i sat there dazed for a few minutes and started the engine. it did start but the battery was low and the generator had burned out giving out no power. it was still dark out but there was enough light to drive with the headlights out so i did that saving power to run the car. we travel a few miles into gallop nm. during the whole incident we never saw another car on the highway. other than that night i don't remember ever talking about it, it was like it never happen.There was about an hour of time we can not account for,i often wondered if something else took place that night.I hope this story makes sense to you.Thank you for your time.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

light 150 away at an elevation of about 400 ft to the northwest of us. as i continued to observe the light, i noticed 2 more lights suddenly. one more to the west then the third almost on top of us forming a triangle that seemed to me to be approximately 150 yards across. it took a minute to realize this was one large object instead of three separate  objects as my view was obscured by me being in a car. we pulled off at the observation area established by the city of kingsport to view netherland inn park as well as rotherwood mansion. we exited the car and began to observe the triangle. the object came slowly from the west running parrallel to houlston army ammunition plant. we watched it(triangle) for about 3 minutes as it came to a stop 30 yards away at an elevation if about 350ft. it was absolutely huge. an irrational fear, at least it seemed to be at the time gripped me. i told joey lets get in the car and leave. the last thing i clearly recall is moving toward joeys car. i saw bright light from behind me begin to light the entire area. the very next memory i have is of joey and myself sitting in front of my apartment building, located about a mile from the netherland inn observation area. neither of us had any memory whatsoever of driving that last mile to my apartment. since our encounter with this object, my friend joey had told me on several occasions that he thought something major had occurred that night . i have recurring dreams of the encounter in which joey and i are being escorted through an unusual craft and feeling as if our escorts are not

night. some of them took their fishing poles with them. we were having a round of mate (argentine tea). i was not facing the sea. all of a sudden a hear all the people there besides my friends screaming like crazy. they shouted look a ufo! a ufo! i turned around and i see this blue (weird blue object) hovering over the surface approximately 200 hundred meters from the rocky shore. i was just amazed and couldnt believe what was happening. people were like crazy, shouting like maniacs. then this round object starts gaining altitude and in a matter of seconds flew over us and it dissapeared before our eyes in what i can describe as a kind of implosion sound. \r\nit left a vapor like trace behind. \r\nas funny as it may sound remember how the de lorean from the back to the future movie dissapeared? it was pretty much like it. \r\nwhen i first noticed it i had no doubt that was a ufo. why? because it was clearly a manned artefact. someone was like, behind the wheel, thats what we all felt. the thing was the size of a small two door car. \r\nfirst i was astonished, and when it started moving and it did that crazy manuever over us i was terrified. i was sorry and at the same time relieved that it had left. \r\ni dont know what else to say. i didnt believe in stories about ufos before the incident, maybe thats why i was so astonished at the time it happened. \r\nwe also felt a weird emotion. its like wow, we actually saw maybe extraterrestrials dude! after it left we wanted to see more and wished it would show up again, its like when you ride a roller coaster you wish it would stop when its going but when the rush is over you want to experience that rush again.\r\nnothing man-made can do what that artefact did. the fastest things we have constructed would desintegrate into pieces if they did what this object did. it was just too fast. i know no living thing can survive an acceleration and turn like that. \r\nand what about the fact that it vanished before our eyes? thats the craziest thing about this incident. it didnt lose itself on the distance, no, it literaly vanished. \r\nfirst thing some people will say is dude, that was a shooting star. \r\nare you kidding me? it came out of the water. it floated over the water, it accelerated changing direction. \r\nsometimes you got to see this things in person to believe them. \r\nanyway, my bro managed to fotograph it. we got the original for everyone to check it out. \r\nyou can also interview my friends. \r\nsome of them were already fishing therefore facing the sea and were amongt the firsts to see it. \r\n\r\nnote: there was quite a quantity of people there beside us. it was what we call \"a long weekend\", that is a weekend plus holydays, hundreds of thousands of tourists visit our city on such holydays so you do the math how many people beside us saw this ufo. \r\nwhat i'm trying to say is, no, we werent all high and allucinating. \r\nwe dont do drugs. we do \"mate\".\r\ncheck out the picture, though it really doesnt make the sight justice by itself.     \r\nyou got to see it live baby!","distance":"501 Feet - 1

white lights flashing erratically outside.\r\n\r\n3. i was unsure what it was. it looked like fireworks or the flashing lights on a police car. i thought my neighbor who had recently left my house may have been down there doing something. i called his home phone and when he answered i told him to look across the field to see if he could see anything. he said he didn't see anything so i told him to come over and to bring his rifle. i then walked outside with my pistol. as i walked outside i noticed my dog hunkered in the corner of my carport with his tail tucked between his legs which was unusual, as he was a pit bull and normally barked all night. i fired a couple of warning shots into the air to scare off the intruder, but the lights continued to flash until my neighbor drove past them in his pickup. they began to flash again when he pulled into my yard and exited the vehicle.\r\n\r\n4. at first the lights looked like they were the size of a beach ball and farther away, but after i walked out into my yard closer to them i could tell they were about the size of a baseball and about twenty or thirty feet away from me. they were flashing red and white, but mostly white. the light looked sort of like the flash of a camera, only it didn't reflect off the objects around it. sometimes it flashed for a few seconds at a time, and some times it flashed only for a split second. sometimes it flashed while it was sitting still suspended in midair, and other times it flashed while it was moving. most of the time the object floated around slowly within three to six feet of the ground, give or take a couple of feet. other times it would move incredibly quickly and higher into the air, especially when being fired upon. the object could stop abruptly in mid-flight and sit perfectly still. it made absolutely no noise and appeared to be only a light (i couldn't see it if it wasn't flashing). the light might be described as sharp, hard and metallic.\r\n\r\n5. i was frightened at the sight of something i couldn't explain or understand. after my neighbor arrived i began to fire shots at it. i fired eight to ten shots at the object while my neighbor watched in wonder. it moved so fast that i would still be firing in one direction, and it would be fifteen or twenty feet in another direction. when i realized i couldn't shoot it i became even more frightened and suggested to my neighbor that we go inside. i would rather have ran away, but to do that i would've had to have driven right past the object, as my drive way was the only way out and the object was in my front yard. i turned around and started walking toward my house with my neighbor following behind looking over his shoulder. as i was walking the whole front of my house lit up all of a sudden and only for a split second. i stopped and turned around as my neighbor caught up with me. he said that the object had flashed very brightly and that the flash looked different. together, we went inside my house, along with my dog who i normally did't allow in the house, and continued to watch the object through the window. we watched it float around the field by my house for two or three hours until i fell asleep, gun in hand. my neighbor stayed at my house that night and stayed up watching it for another couple of hours.\r\n\r\n6. my neighbor said the object was still hovering around out in the field by my house when he finally fell asleep. when we went out in the daylight the next day the object was gone and left no noticeable trace of its presence.","distance":"20 Feet or Less,

light. (i had been feeling somewhat queasy all morning) this light landed and i began to make out an oval/spherical craft carrying 3 ghostly white passengers and arranging to pick up 2 more. they were all somewhat uniform as far as their actions and appearance. i watched closely as the two outsiders dissipated before my fiancee and i's eyes, as if the craft vaporized the beings (possible entry method..?) and as soon as they were out of sight the craft shot straight up out of sight. i walked over to inspect the area and there were no marks left on the ground but i could feel ever so powerfully an aura of energy rradiaing from the entire area (about 25'x20') once my fiancee and i were on our way back, our radio began cutting in and out.*** i believe i heard them speak.*** their dialect was somewhat 'minion' like (yes, you read that right. gru's minions. yes, from dispicable me) and i heard one of them clearly pronunciate \"hello\" and as they greeted me in my own language, i noticed the same white pulsating light closing in in my rear view mirror. no radio stations were coming in. i had to switch my truck to the reserve fuel tank (i had just filled the #1 tank as well but for some reason it was failing) and i gained it away from what seemed to be an enticing visit..As cars passed going the opposite direction they were stopped dead in their tracks, some swerved off the road and caused damage to the vehicle and passengers.. then the light turns blood red. pulsating at about an average human heart rate (60-70bpm), my terror intensified. i am now going 100+ on country roads and it's definitely not getting further, it's right up on us. from underneath i see a bright blue white light as my fiancee says \"this is it\" i slam to a stop, jump out with my rifle and dire an instant warning shot as soon as i get clear of my car door (i'm inside shooting out the window) and jump out. my truck turns off on its own, the craft and occupants are gone. we made it home safe but have seen those same lights again and again. sometimes out back, sometimes right over the house. i have seen these things and they do not i repeat they do not want to be friends!!! i have come out to my truck tore open but no alarm sounding. catalytic converters. i don't know maybe the gold they use in them but the things keep taking my converter!!! for an f250 that's 1,000+ bucks an encounter! they'd be worth more hanging on my wall! i see them running around on occasion, during family gatherings and barbeques out back, it's like they're taunting me to make the first violent move, then i couldn't imagine what they're capable of. i sleep 2 hours a night since these things have been around. i can almost guarantee there is one on my property as i type. i have since rented a more residential home for my fiancee and the encounters have become more and more scarce but my property in napoleon is a hotspot for these things. i only have one message for them: i am extremely interested in your culture and species, i just don't want to become a specimen of your research. please stop harassing my family and we can see that things come to a peaceful understanding..\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:49:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":66887,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.4007126,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06222015-0008","longitude":-84.1242243,"occurred":1376431920000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1434940280000,"summary":"Object chased my car for miles. causing other vehicles to swerve off road. chased me after i witnessed its occupants board the landing craft in a nearby forest...Have had further more terrifying and direct experiences this is just the first, they know i k","tags":["landing"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":677,"locationName":"Napoleon, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:25089"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Astoria","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We are climbing up the hill (in a car) to the astoria column, while my wife was driving, i witness this flying saucer.  it hovered for a while (it is out away from me probably 700 ft or so???

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My encounter happened when i was 9 years old.My family was on vacation from ca.To my grandmas house in thurston,nebraska(near pender).It was the last night of our stay.There was  a big dance at the grange hall,and i went there with my family. at about 10:30,three of the local boys and i decided we were going home,as the dance had gotten pretty boring for us. as we started off on the couple of blocks walk toward home,one of the other boys suggested we go the long way across the field and by the reservoir.That sounded like fun,so i followed them out of town and across the field.\r\nafter what seemed like a fairly short walk, we came upon what looked to me to be a large curved building with windows floor to ceiling.The light coming out of it was like nothing i had ever seen-it was very white and even though it was very bright,it didn't hurt my eyes. the windows were all there was-no real outer walls-it was all windows. the windows were about 5ft.Wide x 10ft.Tall,or 6 ft. x 12 ft. i'm not sure exactly, but that was the proportion of them. the \"building\" was shaped like two disks with windows separating them.\r\nat this point the three boys i was with hid behind a rock,or log or something and told me to get down.I crouched  down and asked them what that was, and one said \" i don't know,it was never there before-that's were the reservoir is\".Well,i thought, these guys must just be trying to scare me,because in my opinion it would take months to build that structure.\r\ni knew there was no way it was built without them knowing about the project,so i thought they must be trying to prank the kid from ca. \r\nso i stood up-refusing to fall for their \"trick\". \r\nthis is when i noticed all of the activity that was going on.That is also when \"they\" noticed us.Then i noticed that i could not move at all.My friends slowly stood up,with kind of blank looks on their faces.By now i could see \"them\".My first thought was that these were marionettes, because a man could not fit into those \"costumes\".Their joints were very small compared to the rest of their body, much like a lizard or insect.\r\nthen just as quickly i realized that these were real....Dudes, things, or whatever you want to call them.\r\nthere were two distinctly different types that i saw.Most of them were what everybody refers to as the \"greys\".They were shorter than me and seamed to be wearing some kind of jumpsuit that was the same color as their skin, pretty much.They had the big head and almond shaped eyes like has been described by many people.I got the impression that these were females.\r\nall i know for sure is that they were totally submissive to the taller ones.The tall ones were much different than the grays-i got the impression that these were males. at any rate,they were in charge and not friendly. these were the ones that had the very small leg joints,so i knew it was not a guy in a suit.They also had an elephant trunk type head-it was like they had a pony tail, but it was skin-part of their head.It was the size of their head then tapered down to the tip, which was blunt at the end, like the fat end of an egg.This \"ponytail\" reached down to mid back, and was segmented like a cartoon inchworm.(remember i was only 9 years old) it seemed to be stationary-that is,they didn't seem to be able to move it, and it moved with their head without flopping around. these beings were taller than me,and seemed to be wearing a sort of robe that was  dark in color-black or dark gray. their actual facial features looked very much like \"et the extra-terrestrial\".(seriously) i only saw two or three of these guys-they seemed to confer with each other and go separate ways.At this point i could clearly see,but i don't know if i was moving my eyeballs,or just seeing what was right in front of me.I was looking at the tall one standing in front of me and i was thinking to myself \"weird!!! look at that dudes head!\" at this point he turned toward me-it was clear he had \"heard\" what i was thinking.He somehow gave me a message without using words-but it was crystal clear in my head.The message was that our worth to them was no more than the worth of cows to a rancher.Their interest in our personal lives is zero.I was told of the futility of our entire existence,and that of the universe as well.The impression i received was that the entire existence of everything has already happened-its beginning and its end-it all happened in an instant and it does not continue.Somehow we are experiencing it in some kind of slow motion.(or the jerk just wanted to scare the heck out of me, and was lying,i don't know).\r\nafter this one of the greys \"spoke\" to me in the same non-verbal way, but this time with words in my head that i \"heard\"(but it did not come in through my ears).It said \"just do what he says and everything will be o.K.\" i remember being comforted by that.\r\nnext my friends walked up a ramp into what i now knew was not a building. i don't remember anything else until we were walking up to my grandmas house. at that point i didn't remember anything that had happened-i thought we took about a 20 minuet detour through the field and came home.\r\nwhen i walked into my grandmas house,i was confused by the presence of many people,and all of them were at the dance just 20 minuets ago....And my dad was no longer wearing his party clothes-he had changed into his everyday clothing.They were all excited that i was home,and asked were i had been.I told them we had taken a \"shortcut\" through the field.This seemed to satisfy them, but i had no idea how it was all of a sudden 1:30 in the morning...All i remembered was we left the dance at 10:30, took a 20 minuet walk home and when we got there, everyone thought we had been missing.I didn't really know what was going on, and i was hustled off to bed.I was extreamly tired and fell right to sleep.\r\nthe next morning,we packed up the car and headed back to ca.\r\nthat's when the recurring nightmares started.\r\nin one i am walking past my house,and a skull is sitting in the flower bed.As i walk by it,it somehow starts tickling me and i cant get away,it is holding me frozen in place somehow.It says to me-\"who am i?\"\r\nand i answer-\"i don't know\" again-\"who am i?\" again-\"i don't know\"\r\nonce more-\"who am i?\" this time i answer \"you're nobody\"-and it releases me.That's the end of that dream.\r\nthe next recurring dream is of me being held captive at the bottom of the reservoir that was behind our house.The \"people\" holding me wore black robes with pointed hoods and we were under water,but able to breath. there is no talking or sound in that dream that i can remember. \r\ni had these dreams several times each,then never had them again.\r\nthe morning after the encounter,i didn't remember any of it,but i could definitely sense that there was something in my memory that was not there before.I didn't know what it was-very vague,almost forgotten in the distant past is how it seemed.It was a while before i realized that something weird had happened.The more i remembered,the weirder it seemed. and i knew if someone told me this story,i would think something terrible had happened to him for his mind to make up that wild fantasy.Even at 9 years old,i new it would be best to keep it to myself.\r\nbut the more i think about it,the more i think it should be told,so there it is.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or
