and pulled out my samsung galaxy s 5 active.   \"i take tons of sky pictures\"  anyways i took probably 35 pictures of the sunbow before it dissipated.   i was showing friends and family when i saw a pretty normal looking lens glare, that is normally caused by aiming the lens at something that is extremely bright... like the sun.  but when i zoomed in i noticed that the glare was round and had four distinct lights on it, evenly spaced and very bright.  so i looked at some of the other pics and saw that the object did not only move \"which is expected\" but changed colors had an aura about it and most importantly the 4 white lights on the circular object changed to 5 and 6 and changed locations on the object.  i have one picture that the \"glare\" is not even reflective.  it just looks like a grey silver object with the four lights on it.  that's what really peaked my interest.  i uploaded many of the pictures on facebook but no one had a good explanation.    even my photographer friends couldn't explain why the dots showed up and why the changed on the object.    \r\n\r\nif you are not able to zoom in on the pictures i'm submitting, please let me know and i can provide more

had no helicopters that looked like the object. i was an aviation buff at an early age. i could barely make out the top section but it was close to the classic movie saucer ufo shape. there were several port holes around the top section which gave away its shape. there was a round protruding section on the bottom that emitted a low bluish tone glowing light. it was hovering directly above the lunch hall which gave me an idea of its size, it was almost as wide as the lunch hall. it was hovering about 30 to 50 feet above the hall. i looked for any signs of people but found none in the area.

covered by the clouds and then not, like it was going through semi-clouds. it was about a few hundred feet above the houses. i'm not sure how high, but it was not that high up.I thought it was a low flying airplane but could only see the red light on the bottom of the plane through the parts of clouds. i thought it was weird as it was moving so slow, as if it was looking for something.(my thoughts)as i walked, it seemed to moved with me, since i was not walking fast, it was not moving fast like a plane would be. i kept watching it as i was walking thinking to myself and i was asking myself what could it be since i could not see the rest of the \"plane\". then it just stopped! so i stopped, the red light stopped in mid air, and that is when i knew it was not a plane. then a few seconds later, out of the clouds above the red light, a whitish- blue beam of light appeared just above the red light. the light was wider at the top then came to a point just above the red light. from where i was standing the distance between the end of the beam and the red light was about a foot or two. i said to myself out loud, \"i will s*** myself if that light goes up to that beam\" and the second i said that, it rose up towards the beam and the second it touched the beam, they both disappeared. the beam was about 3 to 4 feet long and about 2 feet wide getting thinner towards the red light. a v shape. that is about the size from where i was standing looking at it. i instantly ran home screaming to my mother and brother in the kitchen that i just saw a ufo and tried to tell them

force to preclude refugee escapes etc. .At one point the entire battalion had to physically man the the securityfence to contain any major disturbances . around 11 september at about 930pm while i was getting into my sleeping bag to sleep as i was sitting on the ground inside my bag i happened to look up through a clearing in the treeline and witnessed a rectangular object that was clearly an ufo . it was moving just above the treeline from right to left of my position and was weirdly brightly lite . my lietenant was standing right beside me and saw it and about 40 to 50 other soldiers were

sept. of 1980 and most people who used cameras back then only had the 110 camera type. as the ufo moved slowly across the starlite sky i observed what i thought were two unknown looking intites standing at a window or observation port looking right back at us . i watched go by for about 2 minutes and it just went across in front of my position untill it disappeared behind the treeline... it never moved up or down in any way ; it just moved from right to left of my position with the bright stars in the background except where the ufo was . i couldn't see any stars where and when as the ufo passed by because the area the vehicle\\ ufo covered was absent of stars in the night.Some of this report i've probably left out some information because its hard for me to put into words what i

coming from the west mountains directly over kennecott copper mine heading east.  my friend and i noticed it and stoped where we were and watched it come towards us. i never heard a sound  coming from the craft  until it was almost directly above us. the only sound i heard was a kind of buzzing or rumbling and you could almost feel it going right through you, sound that is. once it was directly above us we argued a little bit about how high it was and how big it was. we both agreed it was probably somewhere between once it was directly above us we argued a little bit about how high it was and how big it was. we both agreed it was probably somewhere between  500 to 1000 feet high.  i remember it was hard to gauge how high it was  because of it's immense size.  we also guessed it to be about 1000 feet long and approximately 250 to 300 feet across.   there were three distinct separate cigar shaped crafts, not visibly or structurally joined but  moved as one vehicle the entire time.  each one was separated from the other by about 25 to 50 foot spaces. we lived in the flight path to salt lake international airport i have seen planes come in fairly low but i have never seen anything  close to this size in the sky, even down low.  i am guessing it took about 15 to 20 minutes for the craft to go from  the oquirrh mountains in the west to disappearing over the wasatch mountains to the east of the salt lake valley,  mountains in the west to disappearing over the wasatch mountains to the east of the salt lake valley,  probably about 15 miles across. it never changed speed or course and pretty much stayed the same color kind of a greenish blue to a bluish green. after it disappeared over the wasatch mountains we discussed some things in amazement and wondered what we have seen.  we started walking towards my friends house again, when a friend of mine that was about a year older than me came down the street towards us pretty fast, and asked us if we had seen something in the sky. we both said yes and began talking to him about it, he said he was at a friends house near herriman utah and had been chasing it towards the east until it disappeared over the wasatch mountains. about a minute or two later a salt lake county sheriffs car turn onto our street with its lights on, pulled up alongside the three of us and asked the same questions. he stated  there have been several calls about it and he had also seen it for a short time but did not know what it was either. this took place about 30 years ago and i do not remember much more.  i do remember talking about it with my mom and i do remember her saying that she had talked to several friends that either seen it or heard about it also.  my friend and i did not discuss it much either after that night and i had thought at one time i had probably just imagined the whole thing.  i ran into the same friend  about 10 years ago and we both kind of brought it up again then. we both said kind of the same things about thinking we may have imagined it  all these years, but after our discussion, we both remembered the same story  in detail.  neither of us still have any idea of what we had seen but it was nice to get a little bit of confirmation from each other that it wasn't just something we imagined.  \r\nthanks for listening, i hope there has been others that may have reported this, i would like to hear their stories. by the way even though the sheriff said there was multiple reports, we watched the local news for a couple of days, which is not something 15-year-old boys do and there was absolutely no reports. to my knowledge there was no pictures or video taken.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

together for the holiday. my self, my husband justin, my father rob, his long-time girlfriend lynn, and two neighborhood friends where at my house that nigth. it was around 10pm when my dad decided to go outback and put some more steaks on the grill because him, lynn, and myself where all hungry again. he had been out on the back porch with lynn maybe 20 mins, when i heard frantic yelling from my dad to come out back. everyone in the house immediately ran to my dad thinking surely there had been some kind of accident. what we saw when we stepped through the backdoor stunned us all.\r\nimmediately after stepping on the porch we all saw 6 glowing orange lights in the sky. as i gazed at the lights i had no clue what i was seeing, but it occured to me rather quickly this was something id never seen before in my life. the lights definately not any aircraft id ever seen, and they where all too big and too uniform to be a lanturn or something of that sort. i immediately ran up the steps to the upstairs neighbors balcony to get a better view as the tall trees and thick treeline of the backyard was blocking my view. once my vantage point was better i reached for my phone to try to get a video but to my surprise it was completely dead when it should have had atleast 1/2 a battery left. i remember feeling awestruck, i just could not believe what we where seeing. i remember asking my husband, \r\n\"are you seeing this? can you believe what we're seeing?\". later i couldn't believe i wasn't scared. this is exactly what i remember seeing, almost two years exactly to the date as i write this:\r\ni observed 6 glowing orange oval shaped lights traveling at a constant speed in the sky. the lights where in the eastern sky traveling north, they where all traveling the same constant speed, and the first 5 where all equally spaced in a line the last light trailed behind the first 5 but was traveling in the same line as the others. they made no sound, and didnt seem to cast light but just glowed. we watched these strange lights travel across the sky before us for 2-3 mins, it could have been less time but its hard to say, when you see something like that time is like it is when your waiting for police or emergency vehicles to arrive after an accident, one minute just seems to take 5 times longer then normal. then it got stranger, the first light just dissappeared. it was there then it wasn't. then as the other 5 lights reached the same exact spot in the sky they also disappeared. the event was over, we all looked at eachother in disbelief and awe. the next day i didnt hear anything about it on the new, which surprised me surely other people had to have seen this, and a small airport is down the street, butler county regoinal airport. later anytime i told this story to people, i always say afterward, \"and thats my ufo story, im not saying they where drove by aliens, but they where definately unidentified flying objects.\"

were on cherokee trail heading into town (tallassee) when i pointed and said \"look at that beautiful star\" (way up in the eastern/south eastern sky) and just about as soon as i said that, the \"star\" zoomed (for lack of a better word) to about 20 or 30 yards away from us, running parallel to our truck at about tree-top level. it continued to follow us for about 2 miles and it changed speeds to stay in course with us (when we slowed it slowed, when we sped up, it sped up). this whole time my husband and i were discussing what it could possibly be and the suggestion of a helicopter or some kind of aircraft came up so we decided to stop to see if we could hear anything or just to check it out. when we stopped it went down about 50 yards in front of us (it was still parallel with us at this time) then it came over the top of the trees and hovered in the middle of the road about 50 yards in front of us and just sat there (kind of like some sort of stand-off). we rolled our windows down to see if we could hear anything and there was no sound at all. we sat there for about a minute and that's when we began to get seriously scared. so we turned the truck around and we proceeded to go back towards our house and then it started following us, getting closer and closer to our bumper. my husband continued to accelerate and we got upwards about 90 mph and by that time it was within inches of our bumper. we continued that speed all the way back to the house, then we turned right into the driveway and it turned left and went over behind some trees about 100 yards away. we got out of the truck and i ran our son inside. my husband claims that he could see still see its lights through the trees. my husband soon came inside also. then we went back out and it was gone. we went into town later that night and asked the gas station clerk if she had seen anything or if anyone else had come in with strange sightings and she said no. we were the only ones on that road that night also. and evidently no one else saw what we did because there was never any mentions of any strange activity that night. \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

defense contractor, living in a high-rise apartment building called southern towers of alexandria, and on this particular night stepped out onto my balcony just to take in the view. \r\n\r\nwhile standing there 12 stories off the ground and looking out at the traffic of i-395, i noticed movement in the sky and observed what appeared to be a series of lights emitting from a large, dark, boomerang shape, moving east at approximately 2000 feet above the ground. the lights very closely resembled stars, but were conspicuously moving in tandem across the sky with a large black background. since reagan national airport was due west from me by less than 10 miles, i at first assumed it to be the underside of a passenger jet's wings, decorated in lights, but immediately realized a jet at that distance would be making a deafening noise, and this sighting was soundless. \r\n\r\ni turned toward the apartment and shouted for my roommate, alan, to come take a look. he was on a corded phone at the time, and took a moment to set the phone down and come to the balcony. i kept following this strange, lighted boomerang across the sky, when suddenly the lights broke apart and shot off in every conceivable direction until they faded from sight. my roommate, naturally, was too late to see anything.\r\n\r\ni've only recounted this story once in the 25+ years since, but watching your show has inspired me to share it with you. i've never thought of what i saw in terms of extraterrestrial intelligence, but i do know that this object was flying, and it was most definitely unidentifiable.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

a leave from the us army and drove home to oregon going across the southwest then up through california. after spending time with my folks and siblings i headed back to fort hood. i headed east from portland through the columbia gorge and eventually came down through the texas panhandle back to fort hood. at the time i thought it would be cool to do a loop through half of the us. as i reached texas i decided to drive through the night to make sure i made it back on post on time (i didn't want to get written up for being awol). i was somewhere in the texas panhandle heading south on a 2 lane road (on the map it looked like it was a straighter line than the main road i had been on) and i'm guessing it was about 3 o'clock in the morning (it was a couple of hours later when it started to get light so 3am is just a guess). i couldn't find a radio station and there was no other traffic on this road and there were no lights from houses in the distance. i was doing everything i could think of to stay awake. i kept changing my visual focus from near the front of my car to beyond my headlights to my speedometer to near the front of my car, etc. i was doing what i could to maintain my speed and not fall asleep and die in one of the ditches on either side of the road. during one of these focus jumps it seemed like there was a pale greenish light shining down on my car. then i noticed it wasn't just the hood of my car but the area around my car seemed to be getting brighter. i started to slow down trying to figure out what was going on and noticed the light was slowly getting brighter. there were now shadows indicating a light source high up to my left, but the shadows were getting narrower like something was moving directly over my car, but the shadows kept moving and getting brighter as if the light were coming down at a diagonal starting somewhere above me to my left and aimed slightly off to my right. i had stopped the car at this point and was leaning over my steering wheel to see if i could see the source of this greenish light. i couldn't get far enough forward to see what was above me as the light continued to get brighter then through the passenger window i saw the light plummet behind a patch of small trees through the passenger window and went out. whatever it was i'm guessing it measured about the width of the clump of trees across, maybe 30 feet across. the clump of trees was maybe 50 feet from my car. i sat there waiting for the explosion because it seemed like something must have crashed behind the trees but there nothing. i sat in the car, did a quick check and the car was idling, i had the clutch in and one hand on the stick shift, i was in first gear, and the other hand on the steering wheel. there were no lights in my mirrors or anywhere around me. it was pitch black on a 2 lane highway somewhere in texas. i was thinking if i should see what was behind those trees when i noticed the hood of my car was reflecting green light again. the same thing happened again, a dim light getting lighter then plummeting behind the clump of trees to my right. but this time my car wasn't moving. as i sat there after the second light plummeted behind the trees and went out i thought \"i'm 6 foot tall, i'm in the army, i've been trained by vietnam vets, i'm going to see what's behind those trees\". that's when i panicked. my heart was pounding, i was frantically gulping down air, it was amazing i didn't hyperventilate. i remember being almost out of control as i struggled to get my seatbelt on, getting the parking brake disengaged, slamming the gearshift into first gear, and burning rubber as i sped as fast as i could away from those trees. it took me awhile to realize i was driving way too fast for the road. i didn't start to calm down until i was in an area where there were lights and cars. i was pretty embarrassed that i would panic for no reason. i still had a long drive to get to central texas so i focused on that. it was some time in the afternoon when i got back on post. as i was hauling my luggage into the barracks one of my squad members said i must have stories to tell with a scar like that. i was tired and thought he was just trying to be funny so i said something lame like \"that'd be funny if there were a scar, but since there's no scar it's not funny\". he looked me in the eye for a moment and said something like \"then i don't see the scar\" and walked away. later on i was washing my hands and noticed i did have a new scar. it was summer and i was macho so had a the top couple of buttons on my civilian shirt unbuttoned. there, running across the middle of my chest was a scar about 1 inch across that wasn't there when i left oregon. a couple of beers later i got up the nerve and thought about the lights disappearing behind those scrawny trees and my new scar. i remember stopping the car. i remember the car idling with my seatbelt on and the car in first gear. then i panic for no reason, fasten my seatbelt, take off the parking brake, put the car into first gear and miles later i'm told i have a scar. since i don't remember putting my car in neutral, putting on the parking brake, unfastening my seatbelt, or getting the scar i think all of the events are related. but i don't know. my family and i were watching an episode of hanger 1 and they convinced me that i should submit this odd event. so here i am. i don't think there's enough here to investigate. but even though nothing will probably come from this thank you for letting me write it

10-11pm and in may 1994.  the night was clear and warm.  us 23 is very rural and there were only  one or two other cars out that evening.  a few miles before i reached the us grant bridge which crosses over to ohio rt. 52 (which was my usual way home) i noticed two or three pickup trucks/cars parked along the opposite side of us23.  i thought a few people were standing beside their vehicles, looking up at the sky.  then i noticed a very bright light up in the sky, which got nearer and nearer until it's shape was clearly that of the \"traditional flying saucer\"  it had lots of lights all around it and it was very large.  i'm not good at estimating size and distance so i'm not much help  here.  it was a grayish color, saucer shaped, bright white lights (oval shaped) all around it.  i heard no sound but it appeared so close that i suddenly got scared and pulled my vw over along the road and got out to look at it.  it keep moving very slowly and i felt what i can only describe as a power coming from it.  but, i am embarrassed to say, the craft which i was looking at from the  underside as it flew over , didn't stop to get me.  i didn't lose any sense of time (i don't think) and i just watched as it slowly moved to the east which was heading over to the ohio side of this area.  the greenup dam on the ohio river is where it briefly hovered but did not land.  i got back in my car and drove to the us grant bridge to us 52 heading towards ironton, ohio which is where i live.  i was shocked when i got home and nothing was reported on the local news about anyone seeing a ufo.  that night or any time after that.  of course, i didn't report it either although i often checked on the internet to see if anyone reported it.  there were a few cars/trucks on the other side of us 23 that night and i would think these people saw it, too.  they must have been scared to be called crazy like i was.  i only told my sister and a friend.  the friend said i was crazy.  but now that mufon is so well known and famous perhaps this sighting can be recorded and someone will look it up one day and say that they, too, saw that magnificent mysterious ufo near the ohio river one night in 1994. i wish i had a picture of what i saw that night.  but back in 1994, people didn't have all the phones and camera stuff that they do now.  different times for sure.  peace, kathi l. keeney
