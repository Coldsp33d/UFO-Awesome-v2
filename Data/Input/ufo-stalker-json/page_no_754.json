craft as i was facing the craft directly east in front of me.  i just stared at it and noticed a being through the front window in sillouett staring straight ahead down the river or maybe looking at controls.  i had been reading about ufo's since 1969 and knew what i was looking at.  the being inside was not human.  at the time i did not know it was a grey.  i just realized that recently.  i can draw the shape of the craft but it doesn't fit any typical shape that i can explain.  i can say it fit the description of a one man scout vessel.  it was still dark in town and the being had a little light showing *his/her outline.  he had a big head and scrawny neck, skinny body as seen from the side, could not see arms.  as i kept driving very slowly down to main street, the craft then began to move forward very slowly down the river south into the town proper then down south of town, out of town to the open valley.  then it picked up speed, gradually ascending and burst out of sight somewhere near the new mexico border.  i was in awe at what i was looking at.  i knew what it was but couldn't believe it.\r\ni can sketch the craft but don't have the capability to post it

object with a rock no problem. the object made no sound at all and we watched it travel towards a lake that we fish at about 4 miles away. as the object traveled out of sight my self a cousin and my ankle who was also my best friend at the time all got in his s10 pickup truck and started to drive towards the lake where we thought it was heading after arriving a few miles up the road we can see the object again and as we slow down to get a better look at this thing my ankle turns the truck on to a small side road and as we turned on the road theobject was almost straight above us and just then the truck died everything just stopped working and as the object slowly started to cross over the lake the truck started right back up at which time we all 3 thought it was a good time to get the hell out of there. also at the same time as we were turning on the side road there were other cars pulled over and at least one woman was taking pictures of the object. i remember after the truck died i got out of the truck and asked the woman taking the pictures what the object was and she refused to answer me and just kept taking pictures of this craft. the funny thing was when we returned home and was asked about what happened by the other family members that had seen the same object just minutes earlier we told them what happened with the truck and about the woman taking pictures of this

your database and realized i never submitted it to mufon. wanted the report to be in both databases so that anyone who has a similar sighting can cross-reference. \r\n\r\n\r\noccurred : 3/6/2013 19:15 (entered as : 03/06/2013 19:15)\r\nreported: 3/6/2013 8:26:54 pm 20:26\r\nposted: 5/15/2013\r\nlocation: katy, tx\r\nshape: diamond\r\nduration:20-30 minutes\r\nsaw 10 noiseless ufo's that changed from an orange ball to a white ball to a diamond shaped craft traveling in a straight line.\r\n\r\ni was outside just after dark with my kids and noticed a strange round white light in the distance toward the small airport near my house(it would also be the direction toward nasa's johnson space center but i have no idea how far they had traveled or if they were visible before i saw them). the area where we live is just off fm 1093 heading west out of katy, and although it is growing fast, it is still dark enough to see quite a few stars and some planets most nights.\r\n\r\nat first, i thought it was venus but after a couple of minutes watching it, i realized it was much too large and bright. around this time i first noticed it slowly moving. the first thing i noticed was that it was moving way too slowly to be an airplane and it also seemed much lower than the planes we normally see. living next to an small local airport for the last six years, small planes above our house are quite commonplace as well as commercial jetliners out of houston-hobby.\r\n\r\nafter it had moved closer, another orange light appeared some distance behind the first. as it came closer the bright white light on the first went out but was replaced by flashing colored lights on the left, rear, and right points of what at first i thought was a backwards triangle. around this same time the 2nd orange light turned into a white light exactly like the first.\r\n\r\nso now there is a black triangle/diamond(?) shaped craft, making no noise, tracking slowly across the sky heading nw. at about the time the 1st passed over my neighborhood, the bright light on 2nd changed exactly as the 1st had changed. there was also another hovering white light by this time in the original location and another seperate orange (4 craft total at this point). all were tracking the same straight path and were maybe 1/4 - 1/2 mile apart in the sky. all went through the same sequence of ball-of-light to noiseless-black-triangle. all moved much slower than a normal large jet out of hobby and they seemed to be much larger and lower to the ground than one of hobby's jets as well.\r\n\r\nmy 6 yr old son saw them and said that they were ufo's. i told him they were probably military and i think i probably still believed this at the time. around this time i noticed that my neighbor across the street was on his porch talking to another neighbor. i knew my wife would never believe me and i didn't think my cell phone would take very convincing pictures so the kids and i went across the street. there were several kids in their front yard that my son knew, so while he and his sister played with them, i asked them if they had seen the crazy lights.\r\n\r\nthey said no and i realized that they couldn't see the bright white lights from their yard for my house. just as i was about to say the heck with it, one of the diamond/triangles came over exactly as the ones my son and i had seen. i pointed at it and my neighbor immediately said, \"that's no plane, it's shaped like a diamond.' the angle from his yard or the lighting must have been different a little bit different because now i could clearly see that it did have four corners although the front corner did not have the same flashing lights as the other three corners. now i could also see a bulge in the center of the craft on the bottom and maybe the top had a bulge as well (thought i couldn't be sure).\r\n\r\nall three of us saw the exact same thing as another three craft went over. all three of us were basically the same demographically: in our forties with kids about the same ages. two or three of the older kids also saw it. one of my neighbors was convinced it was one of the drones that have been in the news lately. i think they were far to big to be drones.\r\n\r\nwe went home and i got the kids in bed. my wife's brother called and i walked out into the backyard to talk to him. at this time 3 more came along the same straight line(for a total of 10) exhibiting almost the same behavior as the first 7 with one exception. numbers 8 and 9, as they passed over my house, seemed to either speed up very rapidly just as they passed over my roof or perhaps they went dark. whatever the reason, i could not track them on the other side of my house as i had been able to with all the others.\r\n\r\nthe last one was the slowest and lowest of them all. since 8 and 9 had disappeared, i ran into the front yard just as 10 was flying over and i watched it for several minutes until it was just a dot on the nw horizon.\r\n\r\ni have never seen anything like this before, although i have read several books and watched quite a few tv shows on the ufo phenomenon. i probably would have never posted this though, if it weren't for the fact that on feb 4 of this year, here in katy, someone else reported seeing 10 noiseless balls of light tracking in a straight line. maybe someone out there knows something about these sightings or another similiar one and will post something else.\r\n\r\na couple more random observations: one of the objects might have had a low noise (nothing like a jet) and another of the objects while it was still a ball appeared to emit some sort of lighted hazy fog (electrical discharge?) right before it changed to the diamond-shape.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

30, 2015 at approximately 8:00 pm, over the green valley area of henderson, nv, my wife and i got in the car to go out and eat like we do every saturday night.  we got in the car and turned around the corner just a 100 ft from our home and a bright light caught the corner of eye and i looked up and couldn't believe what i was seeing.  there was a huge triangular shaped black ship with seven large bright lights on the two sides of the v shaped front.  i could see the ship up close as i am sure it was below 1000 ft elevation and still daylight. it had been a rainy and overcast day in the las vegas area and it appeared that the ship had just popped out of a low cloud bank.   my wife couldn't see it as she was sitting on the other side of the car so i stopped and asked her to get out and look up, but just as she started get out it disappeared.  it was like someone turned a switch and it disappeared before my eyes.  i had a clear visual look at the ship for about 45 seconds.  the ship was large with a 300 to 500 ft long triangular sides looked like a flat black wing which seemed very super sonic.  the unusual thing was the lights, they were not mounted on the superstructure.  there was a rigging made with black pipes attached to the fuselage that held the lights and protruded out from the ship about 10 feet.  i questioned how they could fly through the atmosphere at high speed with lights like that.  there were seven lights, one right on the point and 3 each down each side.  they were large,  rectangular, the longest length vertical.  they were 3 or 4 ft high and 2 or 3 ft wide.  the ship was moving very slow, less than 30 miles an hour and there was no noise of visible engines or intakes. \r\n\r\n\r\n  i am very familiar with the b2 bomber as a saw it fly over very low over us at at the rose parade several years ago.  i also had the opportunity to stand under it at nellis afb during air force air show a few years ago.  the  ship i saw was bigger than the b2, possibly two or three times the size.  i is scary to even think about this huge thing was hovering only about five or six hundred above the roof tops of the homes in the las vegas area.

parents and i had been out to visit friends that night. when we arrived home i remember that my parents said that it was very late. we all went to bed. i was laying in bed on the back porch which looked out to the trees. that were on the other side of the creek that was right behind the house. all of a sudden i saw what i thought was the sun come up. there was a blink and this white globe instantly appeared like when a light is turned on. it blinked again and it was instantly closer and lighter. then it blinked again and it was very close, very large and very bright. like turning on a three way light like the lamp that we had in our living room. \r\ni thought this is too bright, and it immediately blinked back to the second position which was a less bright and slightly farther back. i thought to myself, now that is better. \r\ni then instantly felt very tired, and i was thinking that it was because the sun had come up. in hind sight i guess the feeling was like  being drugged.\r\ni told my mother the next day and she said that it must have been the moon because we didn't get home that late.  later when i was a little older she told me she thought that i had seen a ufo.\r\ni am now 69 years old and remember that instance like it was yesterday. of course i have known for a long time that it was indeed a ufo. \r\ni had weird dreams for a long time after that, that had to do with seeing things that were in the near future. as  i grew older i have experienced other \"gifts\" and more recently wondered if i was abducted or visited and if this is why these gifts developed. these include seeing glimpses of the near future without dreaming. seeing auras at times. various forms of telepathy. i was good at math in school, but did it my own way in my head and  was often accused of cheating. i have also seen other things that i cannot explain. i have had to keep all of these things to my self because of my profession. i work as a \r\ndirector of a treatment

laughed at me..\r\n\r\ni used to have this mental exercise i would do to help me fall asleep.. it would be considered a lot like astral projection, you know.. where you can leave your body and be aware of your surroundings.. to a very great detail.. i started by meditating, becoming intimately aware of my immediate surroundings.. i started with my bedroom, then eventually i could roam the hallways.. see my kids as they slept. i practiced this for a couple of years.. every night i would get a little bit farther away from myself. i used to \"float\" above my town, seeing all the traffic. i would slowly rise and get farther and farther away. i could slowly leave our solar system.. leave the galaxy.. see our local galactic group.. i got very good at it.\r\n\r\none night, i was shortly into my meditation, just rising out of the atmosphere of our planet, and i found myself getting pulled into a tunnel.. there were a ring of lights at the start of the tunnel. i found myself getting pulled onto a metallic table, our bed.. there were 5 figures around me, 4 of them shorter, and 1 taller one. they were all greyish in nature with big eyes, small mouth.. i couldn't see a nose or a mouth. i was very, very scared. i was fighting very hard, and they started restraining me to the table. i kept kicking and screaming, and swinging my arms as hard as i possible could. and then, i heard a voice in my head.. the loudest and clearest thing i have ever heard.. either in my head or with my ears, and it simply boomed, \"sleep!\" and instantly, i stopped fighting, i became relaxed.. and i found myself back in my bedroom, next to my wife, the clock said 3:43.. i was out of breathe, i couldn't get back to sleep. i was very agitated.. after a couple of hours i eventually did get back to sleep, and the next day, my entire body was sore.. everything hurt.. after this encounter, my entire life changed for the worse. i cant sleep anymore, i am always depressed.. my mind doesn't seem to work the same anymore. i cant do my mental exercise.. lack of concentration or simply fear of what may happen.. i don't know.\r\n\r\ni have never been so scared of anything in my life.. and i

helicopter for a few. i think the mother ship is right above me as i'm type. the stars in this triangle formation look distorted. looks like tip running light same size as before but a lot higher in sky and does not move. no engine lights. i took many pics. i have no idea why the stars came out red in the pic when their white. only pic that is label is the helicopter that rushed in roaring then stop few miles away seconds after i started taking pics. i've seen this drone many times before. i know for a fact it was not lifeline hospital helie to las cruces or elpaso. i dont think i got anything good on the files but you can try to see if you can pull something out of the image. i think the drone reacted to my camera flash. i can prove bases to this theory to you very easily. also note this is my second case i'm submitting. if you need me to give you the number i can. only contact me if there is something big in the bulk pics. \r\n\r\ni went back outside to observe some more at 1:30a.M. still no movement. drone long gone now. but i'm notice something else. like i said stars dont look normal tonight. most times i see orion's belt in this area. instead i see the same triangle pattern taken place in 5 location at different altitude. \r\n\r\nyes there is a lot of dust in the air noticeable on the mountains and we do have clouds in the area. i'm trying to rationalise that everything is normal but none of it is adding up that way to me. i think there are 5 mother ships park right above our county. and all stars are distorted in the triangle \"running lights\". no engine light. but heavy blinking in random spots. by the naked eye i dont know if my eyes are playing tricks on me if i see outline silhouettes.\r\n\r\ni believe my camera time is off from my computer so you know. unless i really just lost 20min. photo labeled helicopter i think is the one. i know there is a photo were i turned flash off and pecan trees should show up on the bottom in the last 3 shoots. all other photos are only sky. i played with the zoom button to see if i could see anything. the helicopter came out looking like a galaxy on my computer.\r\n\r\nthere are two more photos. i made sure the group of photos were the helie should be in were added. like i said if you find something that you need to get me on the phone about pull up my first case file. other wise i'm sure i was only messing with hafb with my camera flash and they sent their huver drone.\r\n\r\nend time 2:18a.M.","distance":"Over One

only now, they were off in the distance across the highway on the east side of hwy 27. what we saw in the sky were what appeared to be 2 enormous triangle shaped objects that consisted of 3 large and extremely bright gold-orange lights each. **this could also have been 6 bright lights in two separate v formations??** but to us, it appeared to be 2 large triangles with 3 lights a piece. \r\n\r\nas we were watching the lights and freaking out, i was telling my husband that i knew i had seen something when we were dropping the kids off! the lights moved farther away together for a few moments, then suddenly, right before our eyes, one of the triangles (3 lights) just disappeared!! \r\n\r\nwe had pulled onto hwy 27 going south and keeping our eyes on the last triangle. we were speeding down the highway trying to reach a particular side road that we could pull off on and try to record on my husband’s phone.** as we were driving, i was trying to record and did a horrible job of it. i was so excited/nervous that i never actually hit record, so i got nothing! ** the triangle of lights continued moving very swiftly to the southeast. suddenly, as we watched, this triangle just disappeared, same as the first!! it disappeared in the vicinity of the omni resorts golf course.\r\n\r\nright as it disappeared, we reached the side road and pulled off near the new four corners high school. we rolled down the windows of the car and searched the sky to see if it would reappear or if there were any other traces of it. my husband said that if it were any commercial aircraft it would have navigation lights (blinking red, green, blue, or white type lights) like you see on airplanes and helicopters. there was no sign of the triangle. it simply vanished.\r\n\r\ni am not sure what this was. this is not the first “ufo” we’ve seen either. we are the family that saw a domed-disk ufo on sept. 24, 2011. we are still coming to terms with what we saw that night. then to see this last night is mind boggling. i am wondering why many other people who were on the road have not reported seeing this?!

too close and might crash.  i pulled over and put my car in park and the lights dimmed enough for me to see it was no plane and there was no sound.  it was a ufo.  people were talking a lot about this in the 60's and i thought for sure i was going to be 'beamed up'. i saw little windows on the top part around the whole disk but nothing in there.  i put my head on the steering wheel to cry because i would not see my baby again.  all street lights and my car engine was shut off and that made the ufo seem more pronounced.  as i waited for the 'beam' time passed --i don't know how much.   then all the lights and my car came back on and i turned my head to look out the window very thankful i was still in the car, and they just looked at me for what seemed like 5 minutes, then they just disappeared right before my eyes.  they did not lift up or move, just disappeared.  i was 2 or 3 blocks from home where we lived with my parents and i hurried on home to tell my mom what i saw.  i was very excited and told it over and over.  years later i would remember she too was upset and excited and had rambled on about how late i was and how worried she had been.  unfortunately by the time that memory hit me, she had passed away.  i have since been tracked and have seen them in there 'gray' state.  they love the dark because they just barely look different from black, but they do look different.  privately i have much more to say.    after i went back to work i told everyone, no one believed me.  i recounted this sighting for 3 days and nights.  finally i gave up and kept it to myself until way into my 30's and then i told a few close friends.  now years later i will tell anyone interested and esp. since your show has come on.  the whole thing was more of a sad feeling than terror because i felt like this was the end of my being with my family.  some people still don't believe me but now i don't care.  its proven and i'm not alone.  thank you for
