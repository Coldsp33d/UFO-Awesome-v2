in the back yard playing because it was just getting dark.  it was just the beginning of summertime, so mom would let us play outside until bedtime.  my mother had a friend over and was drinking coffee at the table with her.  my older brother was the first to see this craft in the sky, and then my sisters all ran over.  i was always apprehensive and shy as a kid, so i took my time going over there to where my siblings were.  when i got there i saw this craft in the air.  it was silver in color and had a very small dome on top.  it was circular in shape and had blue and white lights at the bottom with a dark center.  i could tell at some points that there were windows in the craft around the small dome.  i wanted to be close to my older brother, so he let me hold onto his pant leg.  that is when we heard all the commotion from the front of the house, all the neighbors were coming out onto the street and staring at this craft.  my brother ran into the house and got binoculars to stare at this thing.  he came to the small wooden fence and sat on top.  i wanted to be with him.  so he let me sit on his lap and even one time put the binoculars in my face so i could see the craft.  the craft just hovered for a while and then it shot straight up.  we never saw any other airplane or helicopter in the air, and were never approached by any authorities.  i'm not sure if anything was in the paper.  \r\na few nights later, my mother was upset with me because i had eaten children's aspirin, because i thought it was candy.  she made me drink a lot of milk.  for my punishment i had to sleep in the back yard all by myself.  she locked the back door so that i couldn't get in.  i went to the side of the house that was furthest from the field of weeds that lined the other side of the house.  i crouched down by all our bikes piled up against the house.  i was in a fetal position when i noticed the first creature.  it was about two feet tall and had a lot of hair all over it's body.  i couldn't understand what it was saying, but i somehow knew that it was peaceful.  it approached me and put it's hand on my head.  then i saw four more coming toward me.  and that is the last thing i remember.  i woke up the next morning in my bed.  my mother was furious, because she couldn't understand how i got into the house.  \r\nall my life, i have had sleep paralysis, flying dreams, fears of little people, and odd scars that appear on my body.  only recently was i able to get a few pictures of what was visiting me at night.  i have always suffered from insomnia, and these pictures are not helping me get any sleep soon.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path then

sky in less than 5 seconds. i started counting as soon as i saw it and it was gone before i hit four. in town trees, houses prevent me from seeing either horizon but man was it cooking!I was outside observing what i believe was a rather unique triangle configuration of the crescent moon, jupiter and venus in the western sky and saw a dim light moving from west/northwest to east/northeast at incredible speed. no blinking lights or other markers. commercial and military planes flying in the area but they appear as lumbering beasts compared to this thing. it appeared to be well inside the atmosphere my guess is 15-25 thousand feet, definitely not a satellite as i observe those going over the house on a clear night as a speck of light moving at the limit of my vision taking 20 to 30 seconds to move out of sight. i see similar lights occasionally when i am taking the trash out late at night and don't usually report them. if these things are ours then we must have really advanced and the public doesn't have a clue. with dyess air force base here i see military jets, helicopters and b-1s day and night but this was nothing like that. completely silent, no engine noise after it passed had to be moving at least 5-7k mph my guess is much faster. no reaction from any aircraft in the area, this must be my 20th sighting in so many years of this same type of aircraft. on a previous sighting a similar object passed in front of a bright full moon and i was able to see a silhouette of a diamond or bell shaped multi-faceted something? i don't have a clue what this thing is but it was an amazing and humbling experience. i snapped a cell phone photo but with an iphone 4 it just doesn't show up it barely registers the crescent moon.

between six and six-thirty, i went to the church i attended to help distribute religious pamphlets to the community. the elder of the church, a man i’ll refer to as g. s. was there along with a deacon, h. g. and another man from a nearby church whom i didn’t know. they were all in their forties or maybe early fifties. we got into the elder’s new ford and rode to a nearby sub-division that had been recently built in the community. g. s. parked along the side of county hospital road, across from a big open field.\r\nwhen i stepped out, i glanced across the field and saw a large metallic ufo hovering above a big oak tree. this ufo was as large as my parent’s modest house. it had orange and green lights along the outer rim of the saucer shaped craft and was completely silent. \r\nthis occurred in broad daylight. the sun wouldn’t go down for another hour and a half or so. and we were close; so close i could have reached down, grabbed a rock and hit it if i’d had the urge to throw one. the others had noticed it too and the four of us stood along the side of the road, our eyes riveted on the ufo. there wasn’t a lot of traffic around but a few cars drove by us. yet none of them must have noticed because i don’t recall anyone else pulling over and getting out to look.\r\nwe stood watching for about fifteen minutes. but nothing about the craft changed. it seems to me that the craft was spinning ever so slowly but that could have been an embellishment my subconscious has added over time. in any event, i’d have to say watching it became a bit monotonous until i’d remind myself i was across the street from an actual ufo. and i’d feel that spark of excitement i’d felt upon first seeing it.\r\nbut g. s. must have really become bored—or else, who knows, maybe he thought the devil was trying to distract us from handing out pamphlets—because he suddenly announced we needed to start knocking on doors. i couldn’t believe him. i had the urge to point at the ufo and say, “are you mad? that’s a flying saucer!”\r\nbut i was a nice young kid who’d been brought up to obey my elders so, as unbelievable as it seems to me now, i did as i was told. all four of us started marching up walkways to houses to knock and hand out pamphlets. i stumbled along, most of my attention on the ufo down the street. i knocked on one door and when the man answered, i pushed a pamphlet in his hands and turned back to point out the ufo, but it was gone. there one second and gone two seconds later. just vanished.\r\nthe odd thing is that the previous night i’d been listening to the radio and a woman had called the deejay describing the exact same craft i saw the following day. the deejay had made fun of her and i had laughed, thinking she’d been an idiot. so, when i went home later that evening i said nothing to my parents. indeed, i told no one for fifteen years and have told only a handful of people since then. people i'm glad to say have believed me.","distance":"20

call to cannes france i partook of a ship's recreation office arranged three day trip to paris.  scheduled to depart at 9am the chartered bus was delayed for a half an hour & set out at 9:30am.  at 11:40am while positioned in a window seat on the left side of the bus i noticed a solid looking, black, shinny, cylindrical object in the air.  just off the side of the road approximately 50ft. & about 50-70ft. in altitude the object wobbled around its central axis at about a 45 degree longitudinal angle in a roughly horizontal orientation.  appearing to be 15-20ft. long & about 7-10ft. in diameter, completely smooth & having 90 degree flat smooth ends.  it first came into my field of view toward the forward end of the bus at about a 45 degree angle relative to me.  with my eyes locked on it from the first moment i followed it until it passed out of view to my left due to the motion of the bus.  i did not hear any sounds come from it due to the windows being sealed & road noise.  my impression was that it was probably silent.  the second i noticed it i instantly knew i was seeing something highly unusual & took care to make a careful observation which lasted about ten seconds.  i was 25 yrs. old, well rested, alert, healthy, felt fine & had normal vision.  the mood on the bus was quiet & calm with many of my shipmates asleep.  knowing that the sighting wouldn't last long i did not interrupt my focus on it in order to bring anyone else's attention to it.  i matter-of-factly told my traveling companion seated next to me & fellow sailor about it who seemed unimpressed.  i did not hear anyone else mention it.  i regret to this day not taking a camera on this trip & therefore i took no photographs of the strange object or, sadly, of paris.  the terrain was flat, semi-arid with about waist high scattered bushes & other low vegetation common to such an environment.  being july the sky was clear & the weather was warm.  there were no trees, phone poles, power lines, etc. present for the object to be hanging from.  \r\n\r\nthe following is for other experienced investigators to determine:  the location of the sighting would have to take into account the existing roads in 1983 & the most likely route from cannes to paris.  the average speed of the bus i estimate to be 40 mph.  i believe there is a small but remote possibility that the charter bus company & the navy have a record of the trip.  i remember passing either the lucerne or the yoplait yogurt plant on the way out of cannes which may help identify the route.  i remember noticing this because i liked yogurt & still do.  after the sighting i felt privileged to have been a witness to such an unusual thing & thought \"cool, i've seen a ufo in france\".  this object was displaying anti-gravitic properties as it wasn't moving horizontally or vertically & flight requires thrust combined with lift to overcome weight & aerodynamic drag.  \r\n\r\nmy strong impression was then & still is that the object was an alien probe.  being a member of vf-21, a navy fighter squadron out of nas miramar, ca, at the time certainly did not make me privy to the latest military or civilian technology (a common misconception) but did provide me with a reasonable familiarity with some navy aircraft.  the object was not a fixed or rotor wing airplane.                        \r\n\r\ni would like to know & have been curious ever since if anyone else reported seeing it.  i have relived the moment many times over the years keeping the memory of it fresh.  this report is as detailed & factual as i can make it & the first time i've documented it.  thank you for reading it.  any feedback would be appreciated.
