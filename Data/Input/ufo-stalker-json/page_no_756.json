us had just graduated from high school, a few were a little older. i had just graduated. it was a party, so you could not call the group of 20-25 \"reliable\", but in those days no one who ever saw a ufo was considered so. our host had seen these things many times. he was by then blase'in his acceptance. i was very interested since 1963 or so, and was shocked to learn of his sightings and so we agreed on a post graduation party. we had much else to discuss, such as our group's eligibility for the draft, the war, government conspiracies etc. since i was young, brash, and non-conforming then i have picked my times to tell this story carefully. the craft was seen by all, but myself and another watched in awe for over 30 minutes. it appeared out of a cloud or mist, just above a tug going up the channel between the peninsula and anderson island. the cloud drifted along with the tug and the saucer hovered over the sound about 100-150 feet, just a few hundred yards away. after a friend and i assured ourselves we agreed on what we were seeing, we called our host out onto the deck and asked, \"is that it?\" he nonchalantly replied, \"yeah, that's it.\" he went back inside. gradually the group came out to view. the craft began to move and went from shoreline to the top of the hill which was as far as we could see. it moved over the roads, which it illuminated somewhat, brightly enough for us to see.It stopped and hovered over a home. we wondered if anyone was there and what must they be experiencing. i remember saying if i were there i'd be  scared. i was really enjoying all this. i was filled with both wonder and foreboding. i had heard there was a small military installation on anderson island, perhaps even a missile silo, but i still don't know if that's true. it came back over the hill and was again in our line of sight. while over that hill we noticed a beam of light going straight up from the craft. while again in view it hovered awhile, and the group began yelling as young morons will do, but we were yelling at it. it shut us up by moving closer. we viewed for so long some lost interest. i watched until i suddenly realized it was gone. there was nothing but a similar cloud in its place moving up the channel. i didn't sleep that night. i went back there with permission and saw what i thought was the same thing again, but further off, at the tree tops at the north end of the island, and in breaking daylight. that was not a remarkable sighting unless you consider the first incident. i took it as verification. i have never seen anything like that since. i was, and remain 100% sure about everything i have relayed.

said i would remember one day. that night i couldn’t sleep i kept seeing tarantulas crawling on me. i knew the alien sent the images. the next morning he said he sent them because; i didn’t tell him or my friend about it, because i was astro projecting to where the alien was.\r\n the rest of his visit was uneventful. when he left my friend and me both new we would never see the alien again. \r\nunfortunately my friend was killed in a car crash a year later. but his ex-wife still lives in this area.

pendleton marine base to visit his brother in or about sept. or oct. of 1965.  after our visit with ex's brother we went to the bus pick up spot on base, but the buses were not running any more because of the lateness of the day.  we called for a taxi many times, but they never got to us.  they kept picking up people on their way to us.  an mp had driven by us several times and finally stopped when it got dark to ask us what we were doing there.  we told him so he contacted someone over his radio who told him to take us to the bus depot at oceanside, ca.\r\n\r\nthe three of us - the mp, my ex and i, were all seated in the front seat of the truck, with me sitting between the men.  as we came around a bend we all three were shocked to see a huge stationary object in the sky that appeared to be in trouble because items that looked like strings of white hot fire were falling from the bottom of the object.\r\n\r\nthe sky was glowing with an aura of light of many colors that shimmered together:  white, silver, blue, green, gold.  the sky surrounding the object and the ground below it were lit up by the brightness of the aura and the glowing of the object. \r\n\r\nthe object appeared to be glowing very brightly as if lighted up by an unknown source.  the object itself was vibrant white.  it's shape was longer from top to bottom than from side to side.  it was flat on the top and bottom.  from the top the object went straight down for a bit and then started widening like a tea cup top that gets wider at the top, but this was wider at the middle of the object.  the bottom was like the top, but turned upside down from the top so the wide sections of the top and bottom met in the middle of the object.  the middle of the object was indented a little with what appeared to be window portals that went around the entire object.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure how to describe this correctly/accurately, but will do my best.  out of the bottom of the object could be seen falling trailing light that we knew in our minds was fire, but our eyes saw glowing white with blue, green and gold auras.  these streams were falling toward the ground that wasn't too far from the hovering object.  it was as though something inside blew up and/or was on fire.\r\n\r\ni don't know when it disappeared from our sight.  heck, everyone at camp pendleton, oceanside, surrounding areas had to see it.  but i don't remember going from the spot where we first saw it, the next amount of time (which i have no idea how long that was as we were driving) that we observed it, and then i vaguely remember saying thank you and good-bye to the mp.  the next thing i am aware of is that we were standing at the ticket booth at the bus station.  i don't remember the ride back on the bus to long beach and my ex and i never talked about it again because we didn't have it in the fore part of our minds/memory.\r\n\r\ni will try to address our feelings here:  when we first saw the object, we were all shocked.  we kept trying to determine what it was and what the heck our eyes were seeing.  the mp radioed someone who came back to him in an agitated state and yelled at him to, \"get those civilians off this base now!  we are closing the base.\"  we all three kept looking up at the object which appeared to be very close to us.\r\n\r\nfrom here on i can only tell you how i, personally, felt.  i do not presume to guess how the guys felt.  i wasn't afraid in any way for myself nor anyone else in the vicinity.  i was amazed and curious.  i felt the object was in trouble.  i felt as though i could hear, in my head, voices inside the object that were highly agitated and fearful.  i know, this sounds crazy and i even hate to say it, but it is what it was.  i didn't know how anyone could get up to the object, that was huge, to help them.  i felt concern about this.  at this point, i have some loss of memory stuff going on.  i don't remember getting off the base nor losing sight of the object.\r\n\r\ni listened to the news on radio and tv and looked in the paper for any references to this event.  i found none.  it was as if it didn't happen.  i know i didn't make this up.  i know it isn't a fantasy.  but i cannot prove it.  i don't even have any pictures except for the one i attempted to draw - i'm no artist - and attach to this report.\r\n\r\nas for witnesses, i don't know the mp nor his name, my ex-husband passed away several years ago, but lots of people in the camp pendleton vicinity should have seen it.\r\n\r\ni would very much appreciate knowing if anyone else ever reported seeing this event and if so, what they have/had to say about it.  thank you all for your efforts to avail this kind of information to \"us\".\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

between 2-3 am...I was on my way home heading toward hillsboro on 16 there is open spaces for 7 miles. there are no houses in between except maybe 2-3..But there are some distance apart. \r\n     as i was driving i saw a light off to my left. thinking nothing of it. i continued on. then i saw it again off to my right over a field. it had stopped  and was just hovering. so i pulled off the road and looked out over the field as it just hovered not moving or anything. as if it wanted me to know it was there. i must have watched it for a good 10 minutes at least. just as i was getting ready to go over to it, a isp...Had snuck up on me somehow without me seeing him. since there were no other cars coming from either direction. since it is not a busy highway,it seems deserted at times...Anyway the strange thing about the trooper...He didnt ask for any form of id...Or even a drivers license. which didn't come to mind till some time later. he did ask me what i was doing there..I said i was spotting deer. and he did say to me..Its against the law....He wanted to know if i had any weapons with me..So he checked my trunk..And then he tells me i cant stay here. not once did he ask for my name or address...Or even a id...All he had to do was look toward the field...Which seemed strange as well. \r\n    since he saw me looking that way. you think he would of at least...Took notice. so anyway i left, and continued on again. and again as i was driving i noticed a light had went past me on the right and was now in front of me off in the distance....As i was approaching hillsboro..I could see it as if it was hovering over the courthouse.....But the closer i got the more farther it would be as if it was moving away...Or wanted me to follow it...Yet it only seemed like it was only about a 1/4 of a mile in front of me.But never left my eyes. finally i got home..It was about 3 or 4 in the morning...Which seemed strange when it is only about a 20 minute drive. as i turned the cornor to my house...I noticed just how close it was..So i got out of my car after i reached home.. went  into the house..And decided to look outside to see if it was still there. so i went out..And off in the distance are some woods..So i focused on the woods. that's when i saw it again.  i could see it among the trees...The woods were at least 3 blocks away. so i stood on  my porch watching it...As i stood there i noticed what appeared to be a beam of light shining down toward the ground...I may have seen a couple of et's standing next to the craft...But i cant be sure...It could of been some small trees...But anyway..As i watched it appeared to me as if they were trying to retrieve something from the ground...It may have been a body of a et..Now i am thinking a craft may have crashed there years ago..And no one thought much of it..So no one ever bothered to report it..I think there is a craft there..As if it had either been buried there..Or something was there they need to get from the ground.. i am sure something was or is still there ...As i stood there i thought i would try something. so i went got my flashlight...And shined it toward the woods. you could see the outline of the trees from the light that was coming from the woods.\r\n  i had a spot light that would shine for a mile..So i turned it on...And off  maybe 3 times...When at first i saw this bright light coming back at me..The next thing i knew..It must of been an energy beam...When it hit me it didn't hurt...But it knocked me back about 5ft. then i got scared went back into my house...And watched it from my window...All of a sudden i felt so tired..As if i was being forced to sleep...I just got so tired..I managed to make it to my bed..And i was out...But just before i passed out...I could hear a humming noise over my house.. whatever it was..It had cast a shadow over my house....And that was that...I can tell you a whole lot of sightings i have had....And why i believe they are coming ..I think i know why..I have to many  it would take me about 3 days just to write to you about them..And to finish my reports...If you was to come to my house..It would take most of the day just to tell them all to you. so if you want to write a book about them..Or add them to one...Let me know..I got maybe 2 chapters in me...May 3 at the most..Or more..","distance":"101-500

it was overcast when i went to bed but i woke at 1 am and stars were shining bright. i laid awake watching the stars then pulled out my ipad to play a silly game before i went back to sleep. both our family cats had stayed with me at the creek side. one was curled up laying between my feet. at 0204 (2:04 am) on june 20, 2015 something very bright caught my attention from my ipad. it was in the furthest left of my peripheral vision as i was pretty much laying on my back. i turned and saw this very unfamiliar sight. i immediately clicked my screen off and dropped my ipad to my chest and turned my head to the east and watched it, there are six prominent trees off that direction and from my view it was just skimming above the trees, though i am certain it was in fact fur back. i thought at first it was a chinese lantern but it was ten times brighter and i could see because the silhouette of the trees it was moving rapidly definitely not drifting in the wind. it was moving mostly straight left to right but seemed to have some slight waving up and down. as it hit the last of the six prominent trees it became obstructed by the last tree and was instantly gone from my view. i'd say roughly eight seconds total viewing time.  as soon as it was out of view my cat startled and jumped from my feet which assisted with an uneasy feeling lol. since my wifi reaches the creek i posted on facebook....You know in case something happens. and i texted my eldest daughter who stayed up late very often. she responded so i called her and told her what i had just saw. helped me feel not so alone as well as to share what i had seen. \r\n i do see jets overhead often so don't think much about them but earlier in the evening i did see one with no flashing lights and it seemed wrong, enough so that i had pointed my bright flashlight at it, but not odd enough that i gave it much thought. i had my phone/camera at the ready he rest of the night but nothing else was seen.\r\n  this was extremely odd and i add it now to two other unexplainable life experiences. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
