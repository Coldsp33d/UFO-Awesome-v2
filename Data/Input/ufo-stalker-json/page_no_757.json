ufo(s) and then we just kept sighting to ourselves (until now june 20, 2015). later we did buy a set of chinese lanterns and flew them over town at night a year later (2012). they were distinctive lights but did not seem the same as xmas 2011 ufo(s). eventually the chinese lanterns that we bought 2012 did burn out at 50 feet over our neighborhood. i was watching mufon - \"hangar one\" program

were horizontal to my position. the pier over looks the chesapeake bay there is no visible shore lines its like looking out at an ocean. the entire sky was covered by this craft that looked similar to the bottom of a very large wooden rustic flat bottom boat traveling side ways. it covered the sky from as far as i could see north and south and was half the size from east to west. i watched it rise from the horizon in the east and as it pasted over head i turned around and watched it disappear to the west never changing speed i almost felt if i jumped up i could almost touch it, it looked that close, it took about 4 minutes from horizon to horizon no sound at all. there were four other people on the north side of the pier but the lights are so bright on that side you cant even see the stars, i felt i had to call someone over to see what i was seeing but i felt frozen and confused. i have no idea of how high up the craft was i just know it filled the sky, i have a very difficult

would jog in the national forest with my large white shepherd. i lived in a rental farm house on passaconaway rd about 10 miles northwest of conway.  my dog and i jogged the same route almost daily in the mornings, as i was ski training.  he was running ahead of me as he often did this one morning in the fall, when i noticed he had stopped, was facing into the brush and was growling. his hackles were full up and his teeth barred. i feared it might be a bear or big cat so i called him off of it, but he wouldn't budge.  not only did i not want him to get hurt but i wanted us both to go back the direction we came from.  then he seemed to totally cower down to the ground in total submission to whatever it was. i was petrified with fear and then i heard the humming, buzzing sound and felt the rumble vibrating through my shoes. i knew that the sound and rumbling sensation would not be an animal but some kind of machine.  i somehow got my nerve up and very cautiously got up near my dog to see what he was staring at.  i was shaking with fear but i felt like i was being pulled in like a magnet would to a metal object. i felt like i had to go to it.  as i got to my dog's side i could hear him wimpering and see he was shaking. we were within 20 feet of this object. \r\n\r\nwhat i could see through the brush was a grayish/black metal looking object that had a military characteristic to it, but was only about 5 or 6 feet in height and seemed to have a crescent shape, not really a boomerang, but an elongated, rounded crescent shape with blue-greenish lights pulsating at regular intervals. the lights appeared to be emanating from beneath the edges of the form.  it was fully on the ground and appeared to be maybe 30' in diameter or less. the ground vibrated and the humming sound was hypnotic and paralyzing.  for a brief moment, maybe 2 seconds, the humming stopped, the lights stopped and my dog seemed to re-animate and slowly rose and backed off.  i followed suit. we backed out about 4 or 5 steps and i took off running as fast as my body could push, my dog right in front- full speed. when i got home i paced for quite a while, wanted to actually go back again with a camera, but instead called the forest service manager and asked if any vehicles were out there where i described.  they said no, but wanted a lot of detail from me. more than if they thought i was a lunatic or pranking them.  they pressed hard for details.  a few days later i got my nerve up and also took a handgun and my dog and went back to the site.  my dog did not have the same level of fear as he did that day, but he was most definitely still quite hesitant of approaching the site.  i pushed the brush back where i remembered it to be and could tell a large object of the shape i had seen had crushed the brush and ground cover down flat and looked “swept” over at the edges, like frayed leaves.  after that i never jogged that same trail again.  it was just too unnerving.\r\n\r\nseveral times over the next year while in nh, at least 5 times, i could tell that i was being followed. in town, at work, shopping, driving.   i moved back to colorado a year later.  twice on the drive from nh back to colorado i saw the same vehicle following me.  once they actually passd me out on the plains between no where and hell and stayed beside me for far too long, pretending not to look at me.  i’ve told numerous people over the years but i never stop feeling the same fear and remember the paralyzing, hypnotic affect the humming sound had on me and apparently my dog as well.  over the years, and i’m 62 now, i have several times had the sense that a being was in my bedroom or house and i was completely paralyzed, yet wide awake.  my eyes will be wide open, i can feel them blink, but there is absolutely no light – pitch black and claustrophobic.  i feel totally confined, like being in a coffin and i can’t scream or breathe or move.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

bright light in the sky.  my first thought was it was a little early for the planet venus to be visible since the sun was still up and it was to low in the sky.  the light was very bright and stationary, it was hovering at about a 45 degree angle from me a few miles away. as i watched it, the light began to fade out.  the light continues to fade out until it is gone completely.  after the light was gone i could still see a gray, fuzzy something, it was far away and it to began to fade out until it disappeared all together. \r\n\r\nthe next night i was in my backyard which is about 3 miles to the northwest as the crow flies from the area of the freeway that i saw the light the previuous day.  it was about 2230 hrs.  i was with my brother and children.  i was showing my brother the planets through my telescope.  i had just finished telling my brother about the bright light i saw the previous day, when he points to the east and says whats that?  i look in the direction and say what.  my brother says that star is moving. at first i don't notice anything, but as i continue to look i notice one of the stars is moving very slightly.   i also note the light which i thought was a star at first is beginning to fade out.  my brother also notes this.  as we stare at the light it fades out completely and my brother says something is there.  as i begin to try to swing the telescope toward the object it also fades out and disappears.   it never really moved that much the orginal location we saw it in, but just disappeared. \r\n","distance":"Over One

super, super fast.\r\n\r\nabout 20 minutes later, 2 more of the same appeared in the same location and did the exact same routine as the previous object.  all 3 appeared to go through a pre-flight

something in my mind occurred to me suddenly how i should go out and look at the stars. at the first opportunity available to me due to a hectic schedule, i looked outside my window and, unlike usual where i'd instinctly look left, i looked right first and i thought i saw an orange orb in the sky; but it quickly became apparent that this wasn't an orb as its appearance almost instantly turned to that of a trapezium craft; one trapezium in the top and another on the bottom: fitted together perfectly. it flashed a series of white (or gold), red and green lights from its exterior, as it stopped hovering and ascended; flying up slowly through the sky- though staying beneath the cloud level.\r\n\r\nwhen it reached its maximum height at about 200ft, it hovered for a short duration of time whilst i took a series of 6 photographs; two of which caught an image of the object. then, it moved extraordinarily quickly through the cloudless sky over my terraced house's roof and i saw at the base of the craft was a brilliant white light; a circle, like a tractor beam, that didn't reflect off any materials.\r\n\r\nwhen i saw the craft; i felt excited and equally scared. i have quite a lot of air traffic in my location, but i'd never seen anything like it. it shone lights unfamiliar to that of modern aeroplanes or helicopters, and was completely soundless until it flew overhead, where it made the sound not dissimilar to that of a supersonic boom, and i couldn't see it past that. i'd never seen any aerodynamic structure fly at that low height before. \r\n\r\nwhen it was out of sight, i wrote a basic account of what happened and texted some of my friends, attached with the two photographs of the event.

over soon after we did and another pulled over behind us.\r\n\r\ndad and me got out, mom stayed in the car with a handgun she kept in the glove box. dad walked over and started talking to some people he knew, and i walked a little closer to the object, maybe 10 feet or so. it was definitely disc shaped and had a white glow. i knew immediately that it wasn't in the inventory of the usaf, because being a boy of that age i was fascinated and loved military aircraft and knew everything the us and ussr had. the disc was just above treetop level, i'd say about 50 fet off the ground. i'd say it was roughly 100 feet across. the man who owned the house it was hovering over, never making a sound came out, looked up and walked over to dad and asked him what it was, dad just shook his head.\r\n\r\ni was about to walk over when mom called me back to the car. i was standing next to the car with her when i heard the jets, f4 phantoms,  scramble from the base. i thought \" cool maybe they'll shoot it

about the size of a golf ball looked like iron ore. it was lighter than iron ore. it sat in the palm of my hand. it looked like an ordinary rock or stone; however, it was way different. it could be transformed into a rope of metallic twine. probably about ~12 inches. i held that stone for many years. my daughter remembers the rock. but, it is now gone. \r\n\r\nthough this story is about my father and his ufo experience in ~ late 60's, i believe it has involved myself throughout the years. but, this is another story. perhaps, many visitations from beings a few times over the years. i've never felt alone and, to add, i'm not paranoid or psychologically impaired.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

overhead with air force jets then following them upward until they vanished in the nj area, along with known experiences of being raised off the bed during sleep at various times.  these experiences continued when i moved to pennsylvania, but occurred more often and i became more aware, attempting to remain awake.  the encounters always happened at night, especially while the tv was off.  my dog would wake me barking frantically, then overhearing what sounded like a train or huge jet overhead.  when i calmed her down and returned to sleep, the encounters continued.  the most extraordinary and memorable encounter (which i will never forget) occurred late 2014 when i fell asleep on the couch around 11:10 pm (having glanced at the wall clock prior to falling asleep) with the tv off.  i awoke or tried to awake when i heard my dog barking frantically, pacing back and forth.  i opened my eyes, but my vision appeared as though something placed gel over my eyes b/c even though i could make out what was in front of me, it was not entirely a clear image.  i also felt something poking at my face and making noises (medium to high-pitch sounds).  it was as if this being was making fun of me somehow...Just poking its long brown/grey finger and touching my face..Cheeks..Forehead.  i tried to reach out and touch it, but felt paralyzed...Couldn't move at all.  i could make out its face, long 4 fingers that were in front of me, eyes, skin texture, and size.  i managed to glance upward and could make out the room..The clock on the wall, (then 11:20), the chairs, and table.  the dog was quiet then.  i had been laying on my left side and this extraordinary being was right next to me..Only a couple of inches away. since i found that i couldn't speak nor move, i attempted to relate mentally to leave me alone and that i needed rest.  i felt my eyes close and woke up...Then looking at the clock it was 11:30 pm. before going into such a transient state where you can't move or speak, i have felt the same sensations of diminished hearing, small cylinders or pistols going off within the brain, and hearing a loud jet-like or train-like roar prior to the encounter. this being was amazing! these encounters have also left sores and small indentations on my body over the years...With the latest one on my arms and lower right leg with present scars.

this event happened a long time ago so it's difficult to recall exactly what occurred, but i could clearly remember what was happening before my eyes. \r\n\r\nthis event occurred in canoga park, ca. it was night time around 8pm. i was hanging with 2 other friends in their neighborhood. v and t live in the same culdasac and lives a few houses apart. we usually go back and forth between their house, but in this case, we were walking from t's house to v's house. we ended just hanging outside talking in v's driveway. v then needed to go inside his house for something momentarily. while t and i were standing outside, we both noticed a strange light in the sky right above the santa monica mountains. i don't recall talking much during this event that lasted a few minutes. we were more in a trance-like state. \r\n\r\ni didn't know what i was seeing. it was a clear night. it wasn't a plane, helicopter, lanterns, or anything familiar. it wasn't a star or planet. the light seemed to be near just a couple miles away in the sky. this star-like object was much larger and more visible than everything else in the sky. it made no sound. it wasn't pulsating. it just seemed to have a steady bright glow. all of a sudden, the light multipled into two identical lights. not sure if the light separated from each other or just appeared out of nowhere. then slowly a third, forth, fifth, and sixth light would appear spread out in a linear formation spanning across the sky. these lights were just stationary for awhile until it started to move in different positions. i could see the lights moving from their linear form to different points in the sky. so now, these six individual lights are stationary in two triangular formations. i was in awe. i could not believe what i was seeing and never have i seen anything like this before. moments later, these two triangular objects in the sky would slowly rotate clockwise, then counter-clockwise like if i was turning a door knob. it would do this a couple of times. i could not take my eyes off these lights. it seemed like i was watching this for a long time. the lights which seem to be orb-like lights because of the movements would then slowly move back into linear formation. it was still, but apparently some lights started to fade away or just disappear. others lights would move towards each other and become one. eventually, a singular bright orb-like light was left just like what i initially saw in the sky. the light then faded away and as it disappeared i seem to come out of a trance-like state and looked at my friend t like wtf just happened? we looked ate each other with amazement. we started to trip out trying to understand what just happened. we made a lot of commotion. we immediately tried to yell out to my friend v who went inside the house to come out. and seconds later he came out to us telling him what just happened. all of a sudden, in the same direction to where the lights were, a helicopter appeared to come from behind the mountains toward our direction and flying away. i don't remember what it looked like though. i definitely knew for sure that these lights were out of this world. this helicopter was loud and moving quickly. the lights on the helicopter was also different. my friend v did not end up seeing the lights. he only knows what we told him. i wished we had iphones like today to record, but it is just a memory. something that i will never forget. it was rarely brought up again between us. i had a feeling my friend t never wants to talk about it. \r\n\r\nanyways, that night i went home, i tried to see if the lights my friend t and i saw made it on the news. i didn't see anything. i believe i researched the internet too, and watched videos of similar sightings. i was a believer. also during researching, there is a book published on ufo's over topanga canyon, which is coincidently in the same region to my own sighting. it could be the same thing, but i have never read it. goosebumps appear every time i see or hear anything about lights or orbs in the sky though. sadly, months went by and no sightings, but i was carrying a camera at all times. i was always looking up in the sky. i would see nothing. \r\n\r\nyears flew by and i wasn't obsessed like i was before. one day i was at home and saw a series on tv about ufo's. i casually watched, because i always remembered that night. then one night i see i see an episode on the phoenix lights which i've never heard of before and it sparked my obsession again. i went online and researched. i would only be interested in similar sightings of my own, but i was surprised and intrigued with so much information on ufology and alien encounters. \r\n\r\none day found myself reading about ufo's on the forums. i think it was a forum on the history channel's website under the show ufo hunters. i was just lurking at the time. i would read all the posts and discover so many things. i would read and find that there was always someone trying to bash or debunk people's claim. because of my own beliefs, i don't understand how a person could rationalize another persons views or sightings if he has never seen or experienced anything like it himself. i know there are fakes, but i don't believe they are all faked. and because of what i saw and how there are hundreds of similar sightings on footage now, i'm just amazed that people can't realize that we are not alone in this world. eventually i made an account and registered under the name lights. i posted what i witnessed on the forum, but now i cannot retrieve it. the forum is now gone from the website i think because the show cancelled. maybe it's been so long that i forgot how to get there. i'm kind of bummed because i want to know what i wrote and most importantly i want to lurk again. anyways i still watch ancient aliens or whatever ufo stuff is on tv throughout the years and these days, but i want to see new discoveries and sightings. i never really got into hanger 1 until now because i recently just saw an episode that interest me. and i am writing again to finally report what i witnessed many years ago because it was mentioned that i can do so. so i am. i hope this bit of evidence helps. i wasn't alone that day,  but in ways i feel like i am alone because i'm more open about it than he is. it's okay, we acknowledged what happened that night and that's enough for me to believe. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

in the winter of 1981-82.   about 1 mile away from the colstrip interchange i observed a bright light on the left side of the highway about 100 feet off the ground.  i took this to be a new gas drilling rig which usually have a light on the top of the rig, shining down.  \r\nas i came to the interchange the light was directly across the highway from me about 100 feet in altitude and a distance of about 200 feet.  the light appeared to be a high intensity search light scanning the ground, and it was moving slowly, maybe walking speed, to the west, parallel to the highway.  it was very similar to a search helicopter but there was absolutely no sound.  to make sure about the sound i turned off the vehicle and exited the car into the subzero morning and listened intently.  no sound.   then i noticed that the stars were not observable for a radius of perhaps 300 feet or more.  i shaded my eyes from the bright light but still could not see any stars except at the extreme horizon.\r\npresently another car came up and parked. the guy jumped out and said, \"what the hell is that?\"  i replied that i didn't know and asked him to turn off his car and listen.  he did not hear anything either.  we stood there in the cold until he said, \"i gotta get to work\", and headed towards to the colstrip powerplants where i was going also.  i stayed for another 15 minutes or so.  the light turned to the north while scanning a coulee and the width of the light was about 100 feet on the ground.  \r\ni don't recall specifically thinking anything except maybe wondering what or who this was.  maybe i thought about the object, wanting to communicate, but i don't recall.   it seemed clear to me that this was not a terrestrial object.  \r\nthe strange part is that i began

what are those?!\" he pointed towards the eastern sky at 3 orange-ish/yellow-ish lights which formed the recurring triangle shape we see so often. my initial thought was that it must be military or show planes or helicopters flying together, as that's a fairly common occurrence. but after a solid couple minutes of watching, i realized they were hovering. they hadn't moved even slightly in the sky. keep in mind we were stopped in traffic, so after that amount of time, any craft i know of would have changed its location in the sky. then, within 2-3 minutes of my friend and i coming to the conclusion that we were finally witnessing the ufo triangle formation first-hand, and being quite ecstatic about that, more lights starting appearing out of nowhere. they didn't gradually get bright, they just appeared instantaneously. within minutes, there were 13-15 lights all in one small section of sky. at this point, they would all sit stationary for a bit, then all at once shift positions slightly, sit sationsru again, and so on. i was able to snap a series of pictures, though they are on an older iphone and the camera quality isn't the greatest. my friend and i were the two happiest guys in the world for days after that. i'm a huge believer that we not only are not alone, but that extraterrestrials have been deeply involved in our progress as a species for probably as long as we've been around. i do not know how long the lights were visible in the sky, nor if more appeared or anything. we reached our freeway exit and the lights went out of view from that point on.
