a living room with a west-facing french door.  i just froze.  outside the french door, i saw what seemed to be the outer edge of a huge, bright blue light, which slowly, and silently, faded into itself.  i was about 50 feet away from the door, with the light an unknown distance outside, down the hill.  the edge of the light itself reached the height of the left door before it faded into itself.  at the time i saw the light, it didn't move, it didn't fly away, it just faded into whatever source was creating it.  i don't know where the object or light came from - i didn't witness it descending or coming from anywhere in the valley beyond the house.\r\n\r\nthe very first thing that i thought i was seeing was colored spots in my vision from looking into lights on the ceiling.  i thought it had to be something i was making up, or a visual issue.  but, as the light faded, i saw where it was roughly situated.  it was clearly behind a mound of dirt that was outside the door, and it was very clear that it was truly outside and somewhere down the hill below.  unlike colored spots in my vision, it faded at a steady speed, and didn't move when my eyes did.  so, i instantly realized i wasn't just seeing spots or random colors.  mentally, i remember being terrified after i understood that i saw something i really couldn't explain.  i stood there completely still, staring at the door, until the light was gone, looked away, looked back, and confirmed that it wasn't there anymore.  i remember talking to myself and saying, \"never mind, i don't need a snack tonight, i'll just go to bed.  yeah, the snack can wait.\"  i ran back to my room and forced myself to sleep, and honestly tried to forget that i even saw anything, thinking nobody would believe me.\r\n\r\nwhen i brought it to my mother's attention later on, she asked me why i hadn't gone to her earlier.  i told her i was too afraid, and i remember her giving me a look as if she was saying, \"don't be ridiculous.\"  she tried to explain the event away.  she said it could have been headlights, or somebody outside with a blue flashlight.  but both of those are impossible.  the neighborhood is gated, so nobody could have walked onto the property from the front.  the light was beyond too steady for a flashlight; people's hands shake too much, and no flashlight in existence that i have seen is blue and turns off in a perfect fade.  it couldn't have been headlights, even though there is a road at the bottom of the hill.  but that's the problem - from where i stood, the road was way too far below me for the light to be from somebody's crazy blue headlights.  a car would have had to be driven up the property, and that's impossible due to how steep the hill is.  it couldn't have been work lights from the bulldozer drivers who began work on the back yard that year, because the neighborhood hoa doesn't allow them to work at night.  it couldn't be any kind of man-made light, because the property is just too big for somebody to be running around setting up lights to scare kids.\r\n\r\neven now, i have trouble putting exactly what i saw into words.  unfortunately, the source of the light was obstructed by me being above it in elevation, relative to the hill the house itself is on.  only a slice of it was visible through the glass doors, but the 1/4 of it was large enough to reach the height of the left glass door, as stated earlier.  the light could have been just an orb, or it could have come from a small ship, but i don't know for sure.  what i can describe is how strange it was to see the light fade into its own source.  the closest comparison i have is if somebody had pointed a concert light upwards at the house, and made it fade out over the course of about 2 seconds.  but it seemed to be its own sort of mass, or ball of light, or something.  there was also absolutely no place for a man-made light to be stationed in the back yard or anywhere down the hill.  the color of the object is also difficult to identify, but not due to my inability to get a perfect look at the light.  i am an artist, and i have recently been working on graphic design projects, illustrations, and video game concept art.  to this day, i can't replicate the color and brightness exactly.  the bright, but deep, blue primary color of the light or object emitting it was so perfect, controlled, and soft, yet strong, i have yet to find an exact blue color to call it.  the way it faded was so smooth, i don't think even a stage light could be a proper re-creation.  it was so inexplicably scary to me, but now i find it a little fascinating.\r\n\r\ni lived in that house for another five years before moving for college at 17, the back yard grading was finished, and nothing strange happened on that property ever again.  we still own the property today.  however, i was greatly affected by this psychologically.  i still have a fear of being abducted or observed, or even seeing something again.  my mother jokes that i stay up all night because i'm a college student, but i do it to make sure at least she is awake to get me if there is another ufo close to the house.  or, at least i will be awake if something was to happen in the middle of the night.  regardless, i definitely believe in the existence of ufos and extraterrestrials after that night.","distance":"21-100 Feet, Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":66716,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.99556872650483,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06202015-0073","longitude":-117.19942992311287,"occurred":1257991800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1434781639000,"summary":"I witnessed what seemed to be a bright blue light in my back yard, which slowly faded into itself.  seen from inside the house.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"92067","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2046,"locationName":"Rancho Santa Fe, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:26470"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Long Beach Island ","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Been watching hanger 1, thought i should share what i witnessed 1 night. \r\n\r\nme and friends went down to lbi for a week, one night (100% sober night) i was relaxing on the beach listening to the waves. all of a sudden this bright light shows up in the distance over the atlantic ocean. i figure it was a boat, but now it's the only thing i see so i keep looking at the light. suddenly it shots across the horizon really really fast, from my vantage point i had to turn my head to keep watching it, so it must've traveled miles in seconds! then it abruptly stops, seems to move very slightly from side to side, then just rockets directly straight up! once it hit the sky, almost looking straight up at this point, it disappeared. a few minutes later i see more lights, but these look like actual boats trying to follow the path of the object. after about 10 min the boat lights disappear and that's the last i saw.

til 3am, so i was on a delivery around 1am with my at the time girlfriend now wife(yes the pizza place allowed riders with us). i was on my way to a delivery (i must note that i've been delivering in this area for years and know it well) while heading east on cranston rd. just past some rail road tracks, when 3 red lights caught my eye north of me, i turned to my wife and said \"oh look they added another cell tower hope it's my carrier\" and went on to my delivery which was a block south of the \"new tower\".  i got out of car went up to house and knocked, so while i was waiting  i looked towards the \"tower\" and the three lights were in a different spot about fifty feet east of were i first saw them. the customer comes to door and i wanted to  get the money fast and get out of there to see what those lights are, so i ran to car and tell wife \"look those three lights moved\" she said \"i thought it was a tower\" i say \"thought it was, must be a helicopter\" so i kept watching it from my car and headed north towards it above a school on cranston rd. i pull on to craston to get closer,i got to where it was slightly at an angle above head just above the school across the street from me and i can see it was a black hovering triangle the three red lights that were solid at the ends of the triangle on the bottom of ufo. i told my wife\" it's a ufo\" she was looking at it not saying anything. it was cold out i had my windows up but decided i needed to hear if there were any sounds so i rolled it down and nothing, wasn't enough for me so i open my door and my wife said \"no\" i said \"i got to know\" so i got out and it moved to the right very slowly to a stop as i watched was looking for signs of anything that would be a normal airship, the it moved up ,then down,then left as if they knew i was looking for our technology, like they were saying hey look we move in impossible ways. no sound at all, moved in ways that seemed impossible.I stood there for about 3 mins watching it then it started heading south east so i jumped back in car and followed till it went behind a tree line i lost sight, then i see it zoom straight up so fast that it felt like a blink of an eye and gone. i'm reporting this now because i didn't know who to report it to til today. i saw your show on the history channel, and that's my ufo story. i will never forget it and

approx.Between 8&9pm. and getting dark out.\r\n it was moving at a very speed with no sound coming from it whatsoever and just before it got over me it turned with a slow solid motion to the right

a bank when it turned a 45 degree turn from east to south,it stayed as level as a straight edge.\r\n about no more than another 2 minutes later i heard a loud roaring and here comes 2 military cargo

tops and then came back in the same eastern direction and went straight west as the first plane did?\r\n the object turned south,it was like they were trying to follow it but it ditched them so easy

the daytime probably doing training exercises to me it was always cool to watch i am always looking towards the skys anyways day or night. i work late nights at a restaurant and when i get off i like to go outside and look at the stars then 1 star caught my eye because this star was hauling butt and it wasn't a plane to the half ass it was moving and how fast it slow down and change direction i'm not know playing expert but i look up at the stars and the sky a lot and the first night when i seen don't start moving like that i knew it couldn't be a plane cause plains cant travel that high up and change direction like it did. so then the next night i go outside again when i get off work and it is around 1 130 in the morning i see it again this time its not alone there was another one not too far from it toward the side so i'm watching and here in the distance fighter jets i look back up again and i see you after 1 the other two basically look like they slowed down and then stopped in mid air and the other one was coming towards those two and as if i were just got closer all three of those star looking things change directions again moving together away from the fighter jets and i'm used to seeing in the daytime at least 2 to 4 fighter jets training i counted six fighter jets that night and like i said avon park air force base was not too far from my house and sebring so for whoever read this find this interesting my suggestion to you cuz i would love to investigate it if i could go investigate avon park air force base area if you go i would love to go with you. thank

center for international astronomy on mauna kea), and setting up telescopes for public viewing.  a visitor asked me what the bright light was in the sky, at that point just above one of the local hills, perhaps 20 degrees from the horizon.  since no stars or planets were in that part of the sky at that time, i said \"i don't know, lets keep watching it\".  \r\n\r\njust a few seconds after that, the craft made a very subtle \"s\" turn as it moved towards us.  at that point i knew it was something different, so i grabbed one of the 14\" telescopes, and as it traveled higher in the sky, i was able to see it two of three tries in the telescope.  it looked like an equilateral triangle with a white light on each point.  the lights were bright enough to illuminate the edges of the craft which were very strait lines.  i hate to use popular media as a reference, but it looked like the craft that is seen in the first episode (or second) of the x-files.\r\n\r\nto the naked eye, it was just reflecting sun light and looked like it could have been the iss in brightness.  as it traveled to the ne, it faded from view, i presume entering earth's shadow around 60-70 degrees above the horizon.  using all that information, and taking the best guess of apparent size in the eye piece that it was 20 meters across.  my training is in astronomy so while challenging, that kind of math doesn't scare me.\r\n\r\nworth noting that the visitor center has no street address, i'm not trying to be difficult about that.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

focused on the hanger i noticed on the flight line a dark object saucer shaped totally black hovering over the base low treetop level.  i watched it for a few minutes about 15 mins to be close to actual time.  then it moved and went straight up and was gone.  when i tried to report it a major storm came done on top of me and i was told not to say a thing and drop it.  so i did and spoke no more of it.  \r\n\r\nsome months later i saw a ufo again.  this time it was lit up and flew fast over the base then changed directions at right angles and was gone. whole thing took a few seconds.  i made no attempt to report that one.\r\n\r\nmy third experience took place when i was out of the navy and in my semi driving.  i was lost on a two lane highway on top of a mountain at night. i think was in maryland and i saw a light in the distance.  i was stopped on the side of the road on my gps trying to find out where i was the gps was not locating me position and the qualicom directions were giving the wrong directions to my stop.  in short i was lost.  i was on the qualicom joking that i see a ufo, then to my surprise the light i thought was a helicopter ended up being a actual ufo and it lit up my truck for about 5 mins then went away.  this event should be in the qualicom record because i remember talking about it on the qaulicom with dispatch.\r\n\r\nthe last sighting i had was in georgia at night; i was at a rest stop resting and looking in the sky when i saw two aircraft flying the light radiation from the near by city was lighting up the bottom of the aircraft and i noticed they were boomerang shaped a pair of them flying in formation.  the had marker lights and three white lights large light circle under it wing tips and center.  those i thing are military aircraft.  but in all my time with aircraft i never saw these before.  i have touched a f-117 and seen many top secrete aircraft fly but i have never seen these land near me.  those are my stories my

her to wake up and come see what was there. i lost sight of it when i ran out of my room.\r\n    there's a lot more to the story, and i would like to speak to someone like an investigator about it if i could. if there's any info that you people might be able to provide me with concerning any sort of identification, or similarity with other known beings of it's kind recorded in your archives, or any similar stories i could learn about i think that would do a lot to sooth my soul, or give me some sort of closure.\r\n    i've always wondered if there was some way i could meet with a hypnotist, because i\"m sure i could draw it from memory if i was put under, especially knowing that i am pretty good at sketching things already. i 'm sure i could make an exact replication if taken beac into my past with a professional as such. \r\n    it's always frustrated me how vividly i can remember the thing but never was able to accurately sketch it the exact way it looked. it still haunts my mind and spirit to this day. i've always had the need to contact someone, not really having any idea who until i saw hanger 1 alien files, on cable tonight. \r\n    i'm sincerely hoping i can connect with someone who really cares, or has a need to know what happened on that one fateful morning.\r\n    please help me if you can, this has been with me forever, and talking to a psyche about it, or anyone else for that matter, has always left me feeling empty and alone, and actually feeling like a fool really, because i don't get the sense anyone has understood just exactly where i was coming from when shared at any given point in life. how do you expect to get a normal person to understand something that sounds so surreal?\r\n    anyway, thank you for taking the time to read what i have written, it would mean the world to me to finally speak with someone dedicated to this particular field.\r\n\r\n    thank you for taking the time to read what i have written in my letter to you.\r\n\r\n                 sincerely,     james \"byron\" hart\r\n                       ","distance":"20 Feet or

outside because i thought something might be following it.  i stay outside about a half hour, but, nothing.  i was excited and scared at the same time.  it did remind me of something i seen years before.  in 2013 i seen something at night in the sky,  about 11:00 pm in fullerton, ca.  where i now live, it was a white light traveling north.  it had no flashing light like a plane, just a white dot going across the sky.  as i was following it i notice this wave like thing waving like a flag, however it was clear but i could see the sky waving where it was at, almost square like.  when the light came to it both the light and the object disappeared.  it seem like it was a mother ship waiting for the other craft to arrive so they could depart, which they did.  i told my family but they

pox very bad to where it was in my brain and had to teach myself to walk again. i had a alot of brain problems after. doctors said id probably be okay. not really knowing what to do. my mom was working late and my dad let me stay in the living room so my sister wouldnt get sick. i was watching t.V. waiting on my mom to get home when the t.V. started going crazy. just static.  i turned it off so i didnt wake my dad. i saw a bright light with a blue tint come threw the window. i went out thinking my mom was back and saw a craft on the ground. i never saw something like this before. i felt almost like i had to go and see it. i walked over and it was making a buzzing noies. and i was greeted by a small gray man. it sounded like my voice in my head telling me id be okay. so i held its hand. it was cold. but warm outside. i remember being showed around. it was very nice and calm. i asked for its name. it said something strange. i told it mine. and told it my feet were cold. the floor was silver and felt like medal. there were others. they checked me out and gave me something that made me tired. when i woke up i was tucked in. in my living room. the tree limbs outside were bent and broken. i realized i didnt stutter as bad or feel so slow. i felt better. i don't knowif they did something to me but i felt safe. and i remember the way its hand felt. i remember everything very vividly. i was little. but i know how i felt and i think it did help me. i tried telling my mom about it. but me being so little she never believed me. and me telling her it looked like a shiny frizby didn't help. i just want people to know if they ever see an alien to not be scared. it held my hand as a kid and told me id be okay. and it helped me. it even smiled at me. its eyes were like a dark green almost! it wasn't pure black like people say. the only people i told this story to was my mom abit. my soon to be husband. and now you. just know from this. they are not all
