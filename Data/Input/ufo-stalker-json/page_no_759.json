so bright we could see nothing else. it only lasted a couple of seconds then stopped. we all looked at eachother and said that was really weird. thinking nothing more we then went inside where i grabbed a can of dog food to feed our dog kennelled outside. as i was walking down the dirt road i could hear the dogs barking like they wanted to get out and get something. as i approached the kennels i saw a figure run across across the road. it made me jump so bad i dropped the can of dog food. as it ran into the trees i could see it wasn't an animal or a human. it about four feet tall with smokey blue skin. everything happened so fast i couldn't make heads or tails of what just happened. i was so scared by it that i ran and threw the dog food in the kennel, with the dogs still freaking out and barking, and ran all the way back up the road home. i told my mom who was surprised by what i had just told her, she said it was weird that we had just seen the bright flash too. not knowing what to think or do we just locked the door and watched tv. \r\ntwo weeks later my mom, sister and i were walking our dog just after nine o'clock. it was dark and suddenly our dog bolts for something in the distance out of sight. she was on a leash so she couldn't get far. once again we saw the same blueish human like thing running out of sight again. we were shocked and rushed home.

trees and grass as far as you could see. i watched a small dot the size of a pencil tip grow bigger and bigger cruising over the top of the brush straight toward me. it stopped right above the house where i was laying in the shade and was as big as my house. maybe 40 ft across it hovered about 100 feet above the ground right over one of the only telephone poles there. the object was disc shaped with a small dome over it. it was brown in color and what has always stayed with me is the texture. it had the texture of an oatmeal cookie but was so smooth and seamless and looked so hard. it had no windows. it was a beautifully crafted machine.\r\n my father being a mechanic i knew that metal did not just hover in the air silently making no sound. i was mesmerized, in awe,shocked and so scared i froze for a short time just staring at it. i don't think it saw me because when i finally caught my breath i screamed \"mom\" who was about 10 feet inside the house doing dishes. the craft shot straight up and disappeared in seconds. it took my mother only seconds to respond to my scream and by the time she threw open the door and saw what i was pointing up to, the object went from a 40 ft object to the size of a small dinner plate and disappeared. it was as if i scared it. my mother saw it but did not see the size of the craft that i saw. she told me not to talk about it. i didn't for

we turned around and started running back to my house. the loud noise of the ice breaking seemed to follow us as we ran. then suddenly the noise stopped and just then we saw a disk shaped ufo come from that direction flying across the woods and the road and then right over my house at tree top level. it made no sound while flying. it looked like a disk with a dome. there were lights spinning all around the disk. the lights almost seemed like an aura. many different colors all meshed together. it was moving very slow and kept moving until it was out of site. i have seen 2 others near my house after this. one was a triangle shapped one that seemed to fly right for me. it hovered right over me. it was tje size of a huge building. my dad also saw a disk shapped one at night outside our

at about 3 a.M. . it was holding the screen door open and seemed like it was almost 8 feet tall. i couldn't see what it was. it just looked like a shadowy figure.","distance":"21-100

totally astounded me! my bedroom was on the main floor of the house and out my window i could see our backyard, the alley and the yard and house behind us as well as a good view of their front yard tree. in that tree i saw orbs that were solid and varied in color, they did not change color but this tree was full of them and they were zipping about the tree and the speed at which they were going

march of 1987.  i watched a satellite type object move in a pattern that would suggest it was mapping the area at what i would guess to be 10-20 miles above the earths surface.  i watched this object for about 5 minutes before getting my friend and his mother to look at what i was seeing. we watched this object another 10 minutes in amazement.  this observation has changed my life in more ways than i care to admit.  i have a weird connection with easter, and on easter day approximately 8 years ago i had a almost epiphany that allowed me to understood how ufo's travel at the speed's they do.  it led me to write a paper which i titled \"the theory of gravity and magnetic energy and their relationship to cooling matter.\"\r\n\r\ni won't go into detail here, but i was married to a ukrainian

patrol of the perimeter fence line of the installation.\r\nwe had stopped to observe a northern section of the fence line. i noticed a dim light in the distance, that seemed to be above the ground level and tree line. so we stayed in the vehicle and observed the light configuration as it grew nearer to our position.\r\nit was a dark moonless night, and you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. \r\nthe one light that we first observed had gotten larger, and it was soon apparent that the craft had a glowing globe on each of its corners.\r\nas the craft continued to approach, the air seemed to get muggy and hard to breath. it was like a dead air situation.\r\nthe craft just kept getting larger and larger, as it approached our position. it seemed like a long time had passed when it finally reached the fence line where we were.\r\nthe size of that thing was huge, it was at least 300 to 350 ft. in length and at least 125 to 150 ft. wide on the tail end of its triangle shape.\r\nthe top of the craft was not dome shaped, but it looked like it was a raised structure with portals along its sides, like the port holes in the side of a sailing ship. they were dimly lit and in a neat row close to the mid line of the craft.\r\nthe bottom of the craft was like a giant convex mirror. every thing that it passed over was reflected in it like it was high noon on a bright sunny day. i could even see my own reflection along with my partner and the patrol truck in it. and there was no light reflected back from its surface to the   surrounding area.\r\nthe craft was moving at a snails pace of about 5 to 7 miles an hour.\r\nif i would have climbed into the bed of the patrol truck, i could have reached up and touched the craft with my hands.\r\nthe craft drifted over the tree line to our south of our position and we lost sight of it. since the craft was moving at such a slow rate, we got back into the truck and moved for a better vantage point to see it egress the area. but when we had moved only about 100 yards to the next clearing, or vantage point the craft had vanished.\r\nwhen i reported this incident to my boss, i was told not to repeat it to anyone. he told me that he had seen it to. and hinted to me that if i knew what was good for my job, i didn't see what i saw. and if i where ask by any one about the situation, i was to tell them that all i had seen was a low flying air craft with engine trouble.\r\nwhen i told him that i knew just what i saw, i also told him that i was a licensed pilot, certified by the faa, and that was no aircraft that was from this earth, he told me to just keep my mouth shut and get out of his office.\r\ni can supply additional information in the form of a hand drawn sketch but i'll have to send it snail mail. i have no way to upload it into my computer.\r\nthe other witness to this sighting, to this day, still refuses to acknowledge any truth to this event for fear of public ridicule.

problem and a big one at that because kym never let anyone drive here car not even me for as long as we have been together (i'm noting this because it was so far out of character for her) so i hope on the freeway and headed towards oregon on i-5n i reminder going through redding ca and seeing the sign for shasta lake the next thing i remember was waking up behind the wheel and the first thing i said was this is the 3rd time we've been around this mountain only to have kym say we've lost 3 plus hours since seeing the sign for shasta lake. this is where things got way out of control kym started freaking out saying we had been abducted not only that she pointed out a scare that she said she did not have 4 hours prior to this adventure. i searched my body and found a scare down by my right ankle toward the back that was not there hours ago. i continued to drive as i was trying to make sense of what was going on, as kym starts  telling me that we our going to die tonight i've seen it happen. i tried to calm her down telling her there is a rational explanation for what we were experiencing so she goes on to tell me that she can prove it to me as she tell me exactly what vehicle is behind us along with the occupants of the vehicle. she continued to predict with a 100% accuracy every vehicle and person as i continued driving i got off the freeway to get some gas and as i'm driving down this road that was somewhere off north weed exit i pulled up to a shack and out comes a armed guard saying i need to turn around immediately i asked where i was and the reply was your in the wrong place. i finally find the on ramp and headed back north on the i-5n getting off in yreka to get some gas when i get off the freeway and start driving toward a gas station i noticed there were no cars or people for that matter except one bp gas station. i pull in to the station and there are two guys inside and of course kym is crying as the two guys watch from inside so i get out and go inside and the first that comes out of there mouth is what is wrong with the lady in the care i explained her father had passed away yesterday and we our driving to the funeral in portland oregon. these were the only people i seen in this town and i had a bad feeling inside my gut as this guy was looking at me with these piercing eyes i swear his eyes were all black and all i could think of is getting out of there. i get back on the freeway and as we started up the siskiyou mountain and again kym was shaken to the core she was sure we were going to die in some crash and not more then 5 minutes later we come around the corner there is a tanker that was jacked knife in the middle of the road blocking all the lanes kym is screaming at me not to stop so i gun it and squeeze by the tractor and concrete medium as i'm driving away i see all the guys that were working on the truck start to pick everything up as if it was staged and they were waiting for us. at this time i'm on edge now with everything that has happened up to that point just seemed like i was in some syfy movie or i was dreaming this though that was not the case at all now we our getting close to the top of the mountain just before the last exit before going down the mountain. i was getting ready to pull over on to the side of the road when i noticed that there was bright lights coming from just over the hill so i continued to drive and when we got to the top there is an exit there that will bring you around a tunnel that goes under the freeway and there was all these people in suits like you would see when there is a chemical spill or something along those lines and kym said turn it around they are cloning people we can't go through the tunnel and at this point i'm believing what she is telling me so what i do i turn the car around and drive down the mountain on the wrong side of the road dodging any vehicles coming up the mountain. i get down the mountain to exit 1 and turn the car around and park it along the road i tell kym grab the water and blanket were our going to hike up the mountain to hide tell i see day light so we get half way up the hill side and hide behind some bushes to relax and take a break not more then a couple of minutes this truck( i say a truck though i'm not sure what it was it did not look real at all) pulled up and then out comes 8 to 10 people in the suites jump out and start canvassing the area where we were parked kym was ready to give up her life and at that moment i grabbed her and covered her mouth tell they left witch seemed like for ever. i let go of kym and she is calmed down a little since the suites took off i look up in the sky and all i could see was what looked like a circle of stars just hovering there you could not see anything else other then the circle of stars and on top of that it was snowing though it really wasn't snow it looked like it as it was falling and yet when you look at it on your skin it felt like ash i thought for of minute maybe there was an eruption or something that would explain some of the things that were going that night. kym kept on telling me that we were not on the earth we lived on that this was the 7th earth in the circle of life we sat there going over everything that had happened up to that time. i don't remember what time it was though it seemed like we were up in the hills for a long time waiting for light of day to come finally it comes we get back on the road. now as i'm driving every time a vehicle was approaching i would have to pull off the side of the road an wait tell the truck got passed us before moving on. we get down the mountain in one piece so i pull off to get some gas in ashland and as the guy was pumping some gas i asked if anyone had died on the mountain last night and to my surprise he said yes a couple crashed last night. we finally make it home and at that night before we went to bed there were 3 beings of some sort you could see the outline of all 3 of them the next day kym an i split up she tells me that i am a constant reminder of what had happen to us. we both remember being in a room on a table that was like metal though it wasn't anything i had ever seen she said she could see them working on my head though she couldn't see what they were doing exactly. i kept what had happened to me for years before telling anyone and on top of that i tracked kym down after 15 years asking if she remembered what happen that day and she said i remember everything exactly the way it happened. i missed a few things though this gives you an accurate account of what happened.           \r\n\r\nthanks james \r\n\r\np.S i member the night has if it happened yesterday it does not go away...

those pecan trees and no houses for miles. as i stood there and watch this blue light for about five to seven mins, i still wasn't convince that someone was doing this until i started to walk toward this light from my garage and the blue light moved further back but as i backed up it came back to its original position. i then stood there for a few moments really wondering what is this so i move two steps to the right and the blue light did the exact same thing i then move to the left two steps again it moved. when i move back to where i first was, so did the light but then after that it move up to the top of the trees slowly and moved backed down level with me. so at this point i'm almost convince that this is not someone playing so i did a series of movement from forward to back and side to side and the light follow as i was making it move by this time my mind is racing and heart is beating a little faster. so i took my phone and started to video it as close as i could zoom in to the light and for the next 30 mins the light did movement from up and down to side to side and finally just disappeared i really didn't know what to make of it then and till this day i still don't but, i

about 10:00pm. leaving my house about 10:30pm, i had looked up at the sky once i had gotten to the door on driver's side of my car like i normally do. after seeing an unidentified object in my development with my father and brother it has become a habit to look up at the night's sky. i had looked over my neighbor across the street's house and had this time seen a glowing  light. i had noticed the object in the sky since it was much brighter and larger than the stars in the sky, it also had a yellow tint to it. i shrugged it off, assuming it was a planet, considering ever since i was a child my dad would point out the lights in the sky and show me which were planets, so i assumed it was venus. i'd got in my car and drove for about two minutes. i started to feel uneasy and had started to get a stomach ache so i decided to turn around and go home. when i had gotten back to my house, i stood outside the driver's door again, the same spot as before, and looked back up at the sky. the light was not in the same spot that it was when i left. it had moved up and more to the right, it was now over one of my other neighbor's houses. i was terrified and ran inside, feeling full of nothing but utter fear. i regret not staying outside and taking pictures. the day after the sighting i had seen two black unmarked chinook helicopters, one over my development and the other over the other side of my city. i had also heard a helicopter fly very closely over my house on june 18th, though i was unable to  get a look at it. i am aware that there are medical helicopters in my area but never has one flown directly over my house as it had the night of june 18th. it was very low and loud.
