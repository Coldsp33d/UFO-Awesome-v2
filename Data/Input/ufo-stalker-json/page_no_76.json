surveillance video which happened to be aimed at that section of sky and found the light he described. while watching the video, i noticed the camera had an unexplained loss of about 30 seconds of time, shortly after, the camera was affected by some kind of electromagnetic disturbance, and after another longer period of missing time, the red light (appearing a dimmed white in the night time infrared video) blinked into view. it lasted a couple seconds and then fainter lights could be seen blinking in and out of view in the surrounding sky. then the main light came back on before the view became \"normal.\"\r\n\r\ni found it oddly coincidental that the cameras experienced loss of time, rather than just go black as if the power had gone out, and then the light suddenly appears afterward. this particular camera has been very reliable in its performance. the fact that the event was noticed by someone else (and photographed) several hours before i investigated the video footage tells me that none of these lights and camera behavior were caused by the equipment, but recorded a real event in the sky.","distance":"Over One

yard and went to get them. she came in excited and told us there was a shooting star and insisted we come look. i told her it had to be gone already and she replied i'm looking at it right now it stopped. i went into the back yard and saw an orange round ball colored like a distant campfire. it was overcast and this thing was under the cloud level. it was bright but not enough to hurt your eyes. it was silent and mildly pulsating. it was about 500 feet away just under cloud level 500 feet high or so.  i initially thought it was a chinese lantern but it was a huge one. it continued to move off after about a minute. it had stopped in plain sight and had been there long enough that i became very aware that it was not normal. after it had moved out about a half mile or so the second one came into sight following the same trajectory but closer to our location. it didn't stop but i could see more detail on it. the first one seemed to wait on it as it had stopped and the second one went to it. then the third one following the same trajectory but was nearly over head of us at 500 ft or less came over and i could see extreme detail. it was a sphere with a smaller sphere inside of it at about the 7 or 8 o'clock position and a third the size of the outer sphere. there was a soft orange haze around it- it was dead quiet. there was trailing behind it but wasn't much and it was in the same color of orange. it looked like shinning a light through an egg and being able to see the shell,white and yolk. the other two had ascended and were barely visible and when the last one got almost to them they all 3  continued to gather and disappeared from sight. i videod over 5 minutes of the sighting but it's no comparison to how it looked in person.","distance":"101-500

sighting is more than 18 years ago. i was pregnant of my first child, me and my late husband were visiting his parents on their ship, which was ankered on the riverside. it was a beautiful sunny day with a clear blue sky. it must have been may or june, they were prepairing the ship for the summer hollidays. it was in the afternoon. we were on the deck of the ship. my husband spotted a small silvery object high in the sky which was just sitting still. he told me and his father. we could see it too, although it was very small. because it was so high up, he went into the hut to get the binoculars. he was convinced it was a ufo. when i took a look through the binoculars i could see a small disk shaped object (silver and white with possibly a dome on top) sitting still in the sky of the town on the other side of the river. i did not know what it was but it looked like a ufo but it was so far away that i could not see it very well. i felt a strange sort of fear. my father in law saw the object too, but he is a very rational man, and directly started to declare that it was a airplane. we objected to that because we could not see any wings and it was disk-shaped. we got into a discussion about it whith him. he did not want to have a closer look through the binoculars. my mother law distracted me and took me inside of the hut. when i came back on deck the object was gone.","distance":"Over One

and the right side was a completely clear sky. i looked up to my right and saw two star like balls of light that were pulsing and hovering in a general vacinity up in the sky. i saw the balls of light had color but i couldn’t tell what color, due to the distance, the colors were blurred together. a few seconds later the ball of light on the right takes off in a rainbow curved shape followed by a red over blue streak of light. there is a flash of light and the ball was gone leaving only one floating ball of light in the sky. at that point i thought it was a bomb and was waiting for an explosion. when none came i looked harder at the ball of light, it just continued to hover and pulse in the same spot. eventually it faded with my drive, but each time i went to look for it i always ended up finding it sitting there watching me. during this whole experience i was getting flashes of someone telling me a story of the “collected” and explaining to me how we will soon become a part of that group. i have an idea for a book based on the story i was told during my experience.
