were there. i remember i was amazed by this super cell thunderstorm i was approaching so i was watching the lightning show.  at one point out of the corner of my eye i noticed these lights in the sky.  it was dark so there was no shape just the amber lights.  it would be hard to tell the distance.  it was clearly above the horizon above any other farm yard lights.  if i held my hand out at arms length i'd say if i held my thumb and finger out to measure the distance the light took up was maybe 6 inches apart.  they were maybe aspirin sized and i'd say at least 1/4 to 1/2 mile away.  below is my account the way i remembered it back in 2012.  i'd have to say i was not surprised at what i saw.  i feel the universe is to big to believe we are the only intelligent life that exists.  i've always looked up every time i go outside wondering what else is out there.  i did contact the state patrol after i returned from my fishing trip.  they got back with me and said there were no other

of yellow/orange lights in the sky on northern nebraska.\r\n\r\ni saw something strange around 10:30 pm. basically i was driving north from o'neil towards spencer on hwy 281 in nebraska and i was watching the sky because there was a storm in the distance to the northwest of me and clear skies north and east of me. when suddenly i noticed lights north of me just to the east side of the hwy. the lights were clearly above the horizon in the sky. it seemed like they might have been moving independently then they came together in a horizontal row of 4 lights and were evenly spaced apart. the cluster appeared to be hovering. then they began to move, but the cluster as a whole stayed in the same place. the light on the right side of the row of 4 lights stayed stationary the entire time and the other 3 began to scroll toward the stationary light. it was like the lights were on something round and it was rotating right so the lights were still evenly spaced and moving toward the stationary light. when a light came close to the stationary light it would disappear and a new light would appear on the left side of the 4 lights. it scrolled like this 5-10 seconds or so. then the outside 2 lights stayed stationary. so between the 2 stationary lights from the left to right a light would scroll toward the one stationary light on the right side and it would disappear when it reached the light and a new one would come out from the stationary one on the left move over to the stationary light on the right again. it did this 5-10 seconds or so and i went to grab my camera and just before i turned it on they all just went out and i never saw them again. it was strange. i've never seen anything i couldn't explain before so this was a first. i am curious if anyone else

rd., jessup md.About august, when, about 10 or 11 at night we all looked up and saw three stars, very far away, apparently shooting at each other.  the three stars were  in a right angle triangle and a moving small light from each of the stars on the end originated a bit from the star and proceded toward the corner star. the light, which seemed like another star would slowly move toward the corner star then go out and disapear about a 1/4 inch before it would have hit the corner star. the 1/4 inch is arrived at if you held your hand out at arms length and put your thumb where the three stars were. the stars were about two thumbs width apart. so both stars sent a small light ball toward the corner star and the corner star would send a ball of light or shoot ,randomly toward the other two stars. this  lasted for at least 30 min. one of the older cousins is still living and quite a few years ago , when i asked said\" yes, i remember something happened that night\" i never asked for any more confirmation. i know what we all saw. during this display of the stars all shooting at each other, it was about 10 to 15 sec between random shots maybe, all the other stars in a normal night sky were visable. i am saying this as i was told that at the distance stars are from the earth that there is no way a light could go from one star to another as it would take light years so what i saw must have been really close to earth.  i dont believe that at all. i feel those three stars, which i feel are likely in the same place as they were in the 1950's were many light years from us and somehow defies physics as we now it to be shooting at each other.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

fell asleep only to shortly be awakened paralyzed hearing a wub wub wub in my ears. a brief moment later this, what appeared to be a blonde woman like figure about 5 feet tall manifested out of the center of the room and came towards me. now i'm really scared now and trying to move to get away from it. there was some type of scanner or device in it's hand and it started scanning my genitals, i could feel the heat from the device. the device was emitting a white laser light dim beam that didn't appear to have a light signature on the blankets. the event was quite uncomfortable as i was still fighting to move while my genitals were consistently getting hotter. i finally was able to move, though it was not graceful at all by any means and reached up as best as i could and grabbed the arm of this \"lady\", as soon as i did it looked surprised and backed up with me still holding on and vanished into the air again while i fell semi out of bed and able to catch myself before hitting the floor. this was the first encounter and most memorable, as i don't remember the others but i always wake up and try to move when i hear that wub wub or static sound in my sleep. once in afghanistan it happened to me also but i had woken when i heard the noises and had my rifle in my lap. it appeared and shined a reddish light at me then immediately vanished, unable to identify it other than it was not a blonde female that time, but was the same height. these two \"sightings\" are about 6 years apart.\r\n\r\ni hope it's not a bother but i'm going to put everything in this one submission. i am military, events of this nature happened even before i joined. it was never up close that i have seen a ufo, but my wife has seen it right above our house before, it doesn't emit light at all. but its the same type of ufo i see when i see it or what i would hope is the same. never have seen a different variation. it's always right above me or out of my eye sight and mostly daytime when i have this weird feeling to just look up in the air like a crazy person. it is a definitive disk with what appears to be two disks in one similar to looking at a plate from the bottom and it is metallic. it has never emitted any light that i have seen. but i have seen it at every house that i have moved to. i believe it is the same craft every time. it has to be, there's no way it just shows up randomly following me around the world.\r\n\r\ni do not want to be contacted or sought after or otherwise interviewed. i have a clearance with the federal government that is in no way related to my personal

with lights on it. it was as if it was made of light. i could not see through it. it was definately an object. i moved very slow from east to west. i would say about walking speed. then it took off west so fast i have never seen anything accelerate that fast. i can imagine that at speeds like that, it would cover hundreds of miles in seconds. we started freeking out yelling and running up hill to see if we can see where it went. my other cousin got out the car and asked us what just happend. he did not see anything. im smart enough to know not to put any ideas in anyones head so i say im going to start saying what happend and armando is going to finish it. so i say i heard a rumble sound and you screamed so i looked up. then i pointed at armando, and  he franticly said there was a ufo and the thing took off that way. he then pointed west. my cousin jose wasn't sure what we were talking about but wanted to see for him self. so we drove around the neighborhood looking up for about five minutes. the three of us saw little white light zig zagging around. we stopped the car and jumped out looking up. the white light flew towards and over us. as it got closer it was obvious it was not what me and armando saw,it was a helicopter. a small quiet helicopter. it was flying in pathe the ufo flew. it was if it was looking for what see saw minutes before. there is no way at the speed

friend. than that time was eleven eleven at night. i saw the blood full moon in the sky and heard the owl. thats when my child hood came in my mind of the owl outside my room on the second story of my mothers house came into mind and all the flash backs, of when i was abducted from six years old to when it came apparent and out of mind. i said to my friend there coming for me, i know there coming for me on the phone and she said who. i said i don't know how to explain it. i just can't just forget it. i hung up and smoked another cigarette than went inside. i stayed up till out of fear and paranoia, i felt them watching me. i didn't see the ship. but i knew the grays where coming for me, like they always did in my child hood. i eventually just turned on my television and kept my light on in my room out of fear. after a while its twelve forty five in the morning. im getting tired i'm hearing ringing and dial tone like noises at one eleven thats around the time i passed out also, frequencies and lots of voices. that i couldn't make out. i soon after awhile felt as if in a trance like state and went to sleep. i started almost lucid dreaming about school and friends, soon it went to this outer space like them. im in this blue room of this ship. sorry i don't recall much, but every time i dream i always search for a mirror to look in. i found it and i saw myself. thats when i woke up and it hit me all, almost like a mental inception. i don't really know how to explain it so excuse me i'm better at speaking vocally. anyways. i woke up these three skinny grays. open my door telepathically. wearing and dark shade grey space suit with a red collar, and some kinda square sacred geometry shaped image on the center. they had three rings on the chest to almost. big omniscient almond eyes. indents where the nostrils are, three fingers and a thumb. they soon swarmed me and held me down. while i tried to scream. everything went black except for them and i. i soon wake up later and hour at two eleven shoo ken. with jaw and teeth pain head hurting eyes hurting feet numb spinal shivers, almost like an electric shock up my back and in my rain. ears popping from air elevation and high altitudes. this is not the first time this has happened lately.. its been going on my whole life, and i do not. know what to do. no one believes me, the time i went to barbados may eleventh to the the eighteenth. i saw them take me again there at  the hotel at night as well at two fourteen in the morning. i woke up with images or visions you'd say of them doing it at three fifteen. i went outside to smoke, even though i felt an entity standing in the room with me watching me other than my mother. i soon go outside trying to shrug it off, than drop my cigarette than saw this blue bubble of energy spark while dropping it. than i felt this shock/daze and poof. the bubbles gone. i couldn't fall back to sleep because of the paranoia. i barely go outside at night anymore. let alone typing this i feel like they know that i am. those are the two abductions i can remember the most lately right now. i know theres
