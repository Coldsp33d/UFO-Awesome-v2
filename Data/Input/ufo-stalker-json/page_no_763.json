but because of the darkness i was unable to see any markings or letters on the helicopter as to identify the helicopter. it did not appear to be a military helicopter nor did it have that louder, deeper, choppy or rumble-type sound that military helicopters typically have. the helicopter had the typical green, red and white lights on it (similar to the life flight helicopter that operates out of the ihc hospital here in st. george 1-2 miles north of the location this helicopter was hovering). these common lights were distinctly visible and the helicopter did not project any other lights such as a beam or search/spot light. \r\n\r\npresuming the helicopter was life flight, i watched the helicopter hover for approximately 30-60 seconds wondering why it was just hovering and was  not attempting to maneuver horizontally as if to fly away northbound toward the hospital or vertically as if it were going to ascend or descend in order to assist a person in need. as i continued to watch the stationary helicopter, i noticed a bright white opaque sphere/orb of light at approximately the same altitude as the hovering helicopter, 300-500 feet due east of the helicopter, also hovering in a stationary manner. (my initial instinct was that the helicopter was stationary because it too was observing/witnessing the sphere/orb and was not in the vicinity for medical assistance purposes.)\r\n\r\nthe easiest way to describe the size of the sphere from my vantage point would be to say that if i had a golf ball in my hand and i held the golf ball with a fully-extended arm out from my body 45 degrees from the horizon (i'm 5'6'), the golf ball and the sphere/orb i was witnessing would appear to be approximately the same size. \r\n\r\nwithin approximately 10 seconds of first noticing the sphere/orb of bright, opaque, white light, the sphere/orb slowly began to move horizontally, maintaing its same altitude, as it proceeded eastward. i observed the sphere/orb for approximately 5-10 more seconds as it proceeded eastward (away from the city of st george toward the vast dark undeveloped terrain east of st george toward the us forest service and national parks areas) having traveled an approximated 1/4 mile during that brief time period at a consistent altitude. the sphere/orb did not appear to be ascending whatsoever during this time period before i observed it begin to disappear from sight. this is where my sighting became most intriguing and defies all logic.\r\n\r\nthe sphere/orb did not fade from sight because it ascended to a high enough altitude (again, it did not appear to be ascending) or because it moved horizontally a sufficient distance as to fade into the horizon. \r\n\r\nrather, the shpere/orb appeared to reduce itself in size..... i observed what appeared to be as if the sphere/orb was making an actual physical transformation. i observed a distinct change in physical manifestation and appearance of the sphere/orb. \r\n\r\nlacking a background in physics or material sciences (or any sciences for that matter), i cannot adequately describe or use actual valid scientific terms to describe what i witnessed. the best i can do is to say that the sphere/orb appeared as if it was morphing (i witnessed what appeared to be actual physical changes taking place) or that the sphere/orb was entering into a different dimension if that makes sense. bottom line, it was as if it disappeared into itself. it disappeared on the spot as opposed to disappearing at a distance.\r\n\r\nshocked from what i had just witnessed, i looked back to see if the helicopter was still in the location where i had initially observed it. it was; the helicopter continued to hover it the exact spot where i had first noticed it. again i presumed the helicopter had maintained its stationary course as if it were also observing or monitoring the sphere/orb. the helicopter continued to hover for an additional 60 seconds or more once the sphere/orb was no longer visible. \r\n\r\nthe helicopter then turned and proceeded to slowly move west-southwest (away from the direction the sphere/orb had moved) and gradually ascended to an altitude more customary of a life flight-type helicopter as it continued to  move in a southwesterly direction away from st george proper. i watched the helicopter continue slowly on that southwesterly path for about 1-2 minutes before i observed it turn back northward, appear to slightly descend, and then continue on a north-northeasterly path back  across the city (as if it were heading toward the washington or hurricane areas, far north of the ihc hospital in st george where i had presumed the helicopter had originated) until my view of the helicopter was obstructed by the bluffs north of my home, east of the i-15. \r\n\r\ni cannot tell you what it was i saw. and i certainly will never be able to understand - let alone explain - the manner in which the sphere/orb disappeared from my sight. but i fully believe that the helicopter i described herein witnessed the same thing i witnessed. \r\n\r\nif you can find out the source/ownership of the helicopter, perhaps they too could give you a description of these events. other than an occasional lone military helicopter in the distance, i have never seen any common or commercial-type helicopter in the area other than the ihc hospital life flight helicopter. i'm not sure whether there are additional commercial or private helicopters that operate out of the st george airport (several miles east-southeast of my location) but i presume there are many, especially those who may transport tourists for aerial views of the nearby zions national park (many miles north-northeast of my location). perhaps they may be of resource for you in attempting to find the identity of the helicopter that i fully believe also witnessed this amazing event were you interested in contacting them as well.

home in oklahoma. about a mile outside of the little town of cincinnati arkansas i noticed a bright pulsating strobe to my se which would have been just about over cincinnati arkansas. first thought was a tower but realized i had never noticed this driving home. the light was sationary and did not move unless it was moving directly away from my line of site it was stationary. i was just coming into the town limits of cincinnati when it moved out over the highway directly in front of me about a quarter of a mile away. i watched it at tree top level until it went over a hill by a cemetery out of my line of site. the strobing light made it look like daylight each time it strobed was very intense and bright. as i drove on down the road when i topped the next hill i noticed it through the tree line due to the brightness of the light. at this point it crossed the road maybe 30 feet in front of me moving to the passenger side of my vehicle. i was coming up on a short straight part of the road so i sped up to catch it now because of it crossing the road at tree top level. i was able to get directly beside it and it was not more than 15 feet away maintaing a speed of between 55 and 60 mph with me. i have a sun roof in my car and the light was like daylight inside the vehicle every time it strobed to look directly at it i had to blink to focus back on the road. it passed in front of a hill and i was able to see it against the night sky which was partly cloudy. there was no silhouette when it strobed i could see nothing but the light. at this point i sped up and got a distance in front of it stopped turned off the vehicle and got out. it passed within 15 feet of me and there was no sound whatever only the blinking light. after it passed i got back in and followed it to within about a half a mile fo the next little town summers arkansas. where at this point i would turn west to go home. when it passed the hill about a quarter of a mile from this intersection it made a sharp right turn heading west i turned onto us ark hwy 62 headed west and stayed parralell with it until about a mile from home in oklahoma. i could see it was below the hill tops still at tree level but was not maintaining and even speed i was having to adjust both faster and slower to stay with it. i got out in front again and got to my house in i jumped out and listened. could hear no sound but could see the strobe flashing off the clouds in the sky. i moved out in the street and watched it fly over the town going west still no sound. i watched it until it was long out of sight. i was tempted to cut across on a cross road and see if i could get directly in front of it for a better look but thought maybe i didn't want to know what it actually was since it seemed to want to go in my direction the whole time.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

in topanga canyon, to look out over the ocean.  we sat in one spot for 3-4 hours, watching the sunset.  the approximate coordinates are 34.059538, -118.616345 (34° 03&#8242; 34.33&#8243;n 118° 36&#8242; 58.84&#8243;w)\r\n\r\njust before the sun went down, there was a cloud nw, about 10 miles off the coast of northern malibu.  it was glowing and pulsating with a deep magenta and blood orange color, undulating and changing in color, but staying constant in form.  it just looked like the sun's curved vibrations were causing a visual light illusion.\r\n\r\nwithin minutes of the sun going down, i mentioned to emillie that google maps had released the underwater topography of much of the earth.  i briefly mentioned the strange underwater formation 6.6 miles off the coast of malibu, which gave the illusion of looking like an underwater base, with a flat plateau as a ceiling, and 600ft+ columns.  at the time i knew this may have been a distortion of satellite information that caused the structure to look like it has a dark interior that could be entered from beneath the ocean.\r\n\r\nabout 2 minutes after mentioning this, at approximately 7:30pm, we noticed a gigantic bright white dome floating on the ocean.  it was approximately 6-7 miles off the coast of malibu, exactly above the location of where the \"base\" is shown on google maps.  it wasn't necessarily a ufo, or a uso, but a \"ubo\" – an unidentified buoyant object.  it must have been 300-1000ft+ large.  although it appeared like a perfect white dome, it may have been a sphere half submerged in the ocean, although we could not perceive any extra light from below the surface.  within a minute and a half of staring at this motionless anomaly, it began to move west into the horizon at an alarming speed, and actually went completely into the horizon out of visible range within 20-30 seconds, at thousands of mph.","distance":"Over One
