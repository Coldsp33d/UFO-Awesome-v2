i quickly realized it didn't fit what i expected to see out there---didn’t quite fit in, you might say. it was too high to be a smokestack marker or similar orientation light, and all of those around here on top of buildings have to be pulsating lights, because there is a small airport very nearby, to the ne, so the planes need warning lights for any possible high obstacles to be encountered above the treeline. (i am on the airport's approach path, so i see small craft circling to land all the time, although the runway itself is totally out of my sight, beyond the treeline.)\r\n\r\ni watched the oddball white light to see if i could figure it out---was it coming from a building? from on top of a building? etc., and then tried to orient my eyes to stationary lights around it, to see if it was actually moving, but just very slowly. turns out, it was moving. and yes, rather slowly.\r\n\r\nthis light (\"light 1\") came toward my relative direction at this slow and steady pace. i noted that it was one large white light, no pulsation of any kind, no orientation lights such as would be evident for airplanes or helicopters. i listened for a helicopter sound too (the river reflects sounds very well, boosting anything, land or sea or air; however, helicopters themselves are uncommon at my location, and if they do come by, i can distinctly hear them---there is that distinct droning sound). well, no helicopter sound. i report no sounds of that kind to be heard, just the usual ambient car sounds.\r\n\r\nafter, say, at least two full minutes, another identical white light (\"light 2\") popped up in the same beginning position in which i had sighted the first (light 1). hmmm.\r\n\r\nin the meantime, the original light (light 1) came toward my building, and when it was almost overhead, i saw that another light was above me (not directly, but almost directly) that didn't seem like an airplane, but which had a winking white light and at least one red light on it (i call this \"light 4\", because there were eventually three that came from the same direction, and this one, the fourth, was an exception in that respect). it blinked in and out of the cloud cover (so i am not positive it was actually itself blinking; it could have been floaty clouds making this effect), but still seemed to remain perfectly stationary. not progressing in position, in other words; actually still. i don't think this one was moving, slowly or otherwise. it was simply present.\r\n\r\nthe original white light i had spotted (light 1) moved on its course at level speed, and the second light (light 2) that had popped into sight proceeded toward this area too, but on a slightly different vector, eventually passing over my building. as i noted the journey of this second white light, i saw a third light (\"light 3\") pop up in the original location in the distance, and proceed at the same slow speed toward my building, but again, on a different vector from lights 1 and 2. i looked above to see where the hovering light with a red light was. i could not see it anymore, but can't be certain whether the clouds were simply covering it now.\r\n\r\ni am of the impression that the three moving lights ascended in height gradually from their \"origin point\", but can't be certain. it just seems so to me. i would estimate, at their highest, they were slightly lower than light 4; reason being, i never saw cloud cover smear them in any way, whereas light 4 was slightly above the drifting clouds. (if i hadn't seen light 4, with \"drifting stringy cloud\" effect evident on its bottom \"surface\", i wouldn't have known there were any clouds, the night sky was so dark.)\r\n\r\ni watched to see if another light would appear from the middle distance, that original spot out toward long island sound. none appeared. all three of the steady white, slowly moving lights, had simply taken their paths, each in their turn, silent and undisturbed, over my building on their slightly different vectors, and that was that. it took, i would estimate, about 10 minutes altogether. it's possible it started a few minutes earlier than i stated---i didn't mark the start time absolutely. i would estimate, at the very most, it would still have taken no more than 15 minutes for all this to transpire. after i was satisfied no more was to appear, i called my mother (i finally looked at the clock to make sure it wasn't too late to call her---it was just about 9:55 at this point) and told her all about it.\r\n\r\nthe \"event\" was over. nothing further showed up in the sky of any note that evening. also: the cats didn't seem to really care or notice. no weird vibes, in other words. were asleep a few feet away. i had the tv on low throughout, and service was not disrupted. in terms of my feelings about all this, i was intrigued, but not frightened, anxious, or excited. i’m not someone who “needs” to see ufos…i just thought this was singular, and wanted to report it.\r\n\r\nnow, on this same day, much earlier in the day, there had been an accident in that relative location out toward the harbor. around 10:00 that morning, a man had fallen from a bridge on the interstate when he was working on some kind of repair. he fell into the water, and had to be fished out. he survived, but sustained a heart attack immediately after he was rescued, and was in crisis. emergency crew had to be rushed in. he was taken to the enormous hospital complex that is about seven minutes from here. osha people were brought in to see if there were safety violations at the site. perhaps they came in by helicopter to view the bridge and surrounding area. (i didn’t see any sign of these during daylight, however.)\r\n\r\nso it’s possible these lights were three helicopters leaving, in succession, from that spot. that would square with logic of a sort. however: i do not think there are any helipads there in that crowded gas depot area; they would be coming in from the airport, and these were not, imo, coming from there. and these lights seemed to originate at the point where they popped into my sight---they didn’t approach that spot from a distance. also, i saw no orientation lights for helicopters; i heard no helicopter noise. i’m just mentioning this out of fairness to the evaluation. the local newspaper, and our local tv station, each had an article online yesterday that will support the account of the incident at the bridge.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":66521,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.309385536197745,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06172015-0011","longitude":-72.89083673590045,"occurred":1434490800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1434543731000,"summary":"Saw three bright lights moving above i-95. showed up one at a time, each moving separately from same \"launch point\", eventually numbering 3 such events. moved slow and steady from the same point but in slightly different vectors. saw a fourth above me.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"06513","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"New Haven, Connecticut","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:27692"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Sunset","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband and i went out at midnight on new year's eve to watch fireworks welcoming the new year.  we saw a few fireworks, and then about five minutes after midnight we watched some unknown reddish-orange discs moving across the horizon above the tree line.  they made no sound and moved in unison towards the northwest.  at least five were in a straight line and there were a couple above and a couple below that line.

the only other thing i remember from these experiences; because i believe i was visited several times, was standing in my backyard looking at a tall, slender, gray alien wearing a shiny metallic like

physically to me as a thank you for letting them extract \"technology\" from my skull. these realizations have just within the past few months become clear to me and finally like some kind of fog has

dr. in las vegas.  i was headed towards westbound 215 in henderson.  somewhere around tropicana, which is the next major street south of flamingo, i was looking into the sky above the horizon.  right around that approximate area is where what i believe the airspace is for mccarran international airport would exist, for planes to approach for a landing from the east.  this is one of the busiest airports in the world, and there is a lot of air traffic.  i tend to see planes fly in for a landing maybe 15 - 30 seconds apart all day long.  they follow the same basic flight path.  \r\n\r\ni was driving alone on the freeway headed to go to a business meeting.  but i am always looking at airplanes flying in the distance or overhead.  i love to watch the planes so i usually look at them.  there is more than one flight path, but this particular flight path where i usually see a lot of planes is in the general direction just east of the airport, sort of between tropicana on the north and sunset on the south.   i had nothing else to focus my attention on but having my eyes on the road and look into the sky above the horizon.  the traffic was light.  there were no clouds at all in the sky, as typical for las vegas.  \r\n\r\nthen i noticed two small round or circular objects in the sky.  one was completely motionless or hovering.  the other one was moving horizontally to the west, away from the stationary object and towards the airport.  i thought that was rather odd because i never saw anything in that airspace during the daytime except airplanes.  they had no wings or other visible features.  \r\n\r\ni sometimes see other airplanes flying much higher in the sky, usually from west to east, and they usually appear to be the same small size as these strange objects, but i can always recognize an airplane by its motion, size, and i think i can always see wings and a tail to recognize the shape of an airplane.  these objects were round, or possibly disc-shaped, and had no wings.  also, anything staying completely still in the air would not stay up in the air very long.  or so i thought to myself.  \r\n\r\nso i first thought these might be airplanes, but as i continued to stare at them it occurred to me that they were not airplanes at all.  the one that was motionless did not change size, so it was not perhaps flying towards me or away from me.  both remained the same size and shape all the while i watched them.  but the one on the right was the only one moving, although not very fast from my perspective.\r\n\r\nthey had the same color.  sort of metallic color.  i couldn't tell how high they were because i could not determine the size.  i needed one of those two variables to judge either size or distance, or even speed.\r\n\r\ni kept thinking how odd this was.  and having 2 objects the same size so close together instead of just one was even stranger.  i also thought that nothing should be within the airspace of mccarran.  i did think perhaps these might be small drones, the kind that hobbyists might use to mount a camera on to do photography, but even with that, i would doubt they would be allowed that close to a major airport.  \r\n\r\ni am not sure how i lost sight of them, either i drove past and underneath where the objects were in the sky, putting me south of them, or they just disappeared from view, as fast as in the blink of an eye.  but since i had to keep my eyes on the road i am not sure how they disappeared.\r\n\r\nthey did not return, although i kept looking for more nor did i see these again.  i did not hear any sounds because i had my car windows rolled up and i was playing my car radio.  i did not see any lights or anything else strange about them.\r\n\r\nthe only things that were strange was their proximity to the airport, the fact there were 2 of them because airplanes do not travel in pairs, the way they had no wings, and one was stationery in the sky while the other one was moving in a path.  i think it was moving in a straight line, but i am not really sure because i kept trying to figure out what i was looking at, and steer the car at the same time.\r\n\r\nsorry i don't have any sketches or photos or videos.  i would have had to pull off the road in order to get out a camera from my purse.  my camera probably would not have captured images of something that small either against the cloudless sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

westerly sky, because many stars were visible.  i did not see any airplanes in the sky.  within about 2 minutes of looking around the sky i observed a single big flash of light. the blink/flash lasted about half a second.  when i first saw the flash my first thought was meteor that burned out as soon as i saw it, but there was no glowing wake tail. and then within less than 5 seconds i see a 2nd flash of light at about same elevation but much further north, then a 3rd flash of light a few seconds later still further north (nw sky), then a 4th flash back towards south (wsw), and then after a gap of about 15 to 20 seconds a final 5th flash in the sse sky.  after waiting a minute with no further observations of light flashes i walked swiftly to retrieve my mobile phone.  i picked up my phone inside and quickly went back outside to view the sky.  i remained gazing at the sky for about 5 minutes, and  observed typical airplane traffic, 3 planes going different directions at different altitudes and at typical speeds, and all planes at much higher elevation above the horizon than the light flashes that i had observed minutes before. i was in awe of how fast the flash had moved across the sky. no airplane moves so quickly across the sky.  the international space station does not move this quickly across the sky or change direction with such agility. i thought, well, these 5 flashes of light could be more than 1 craft/object/entity, but my belief is that it was the same craft/object/entity. i have never observed anything like this before. no sound, just light, and amazing speed. i would like to know if any air traffic controllers in the area detected any super-sonic, near light speed aircraft on their instruments.

almost as though it was camouflaging itself in the night sky - only to reappear slowly again several seconds later.  if i hadn't been looking in its direction at the moment i did, i would have missed it, despite it being so large, because of the way it sort of fit in with the night sky when it would show itself.  as it came a little closer, i noticed lights from underneath it, but then i also noticed that it faded in, or disappeared, more frequently and that its shape became sort of lost or not as discernible as it had been.  what did become more discernible, however, were the lights underneath it.  by the time it was nearing my home, i saw one large circle with about 15-20 red globes of light within the circle.  i then realized the lights were underneath something, but the object was not discernible around or over the lights at this point. everything looked just really dark, but i knew it was there and i sensed it was there.  i'm not great at measuring distance, but the circle of lights was perhaps about 10-15 feet around, maybe a bit more, about 400-500 feet up.  it was totally silent.  i saw the circle of lights then move very slightly and slowly in a northwesternly direction above my home.  the lights did not move, but the entire circle moved with the lights inside it.  at this point, i became afraid and grabbed my dog.  i ran from my back door through my house to my front living room window as it faces north, to see if i could follow it, but when i looked out my front window it had disappeared.  it was just gone.\r\n\r\ni live fairly close to a chicago airport (about 30 minutes south) and am very familiar with the sights and sounds of airplanes, whether they are flying high or low, daytime or nighttime, but this was not like anything i had ever seen before in the sky.  it didn't make one sound, and was very large.  there are always planes flying in their flight paths over my neighborhood and my home, but strangely enough, there wasn't one plane in sight during that time that i could see or that i could hear.  just silence.  my husband and son were not home at the time, and i did not have my cell phone on me when this occurred as i was just letting my dog out and had left it in the house - never imaging that i would be witnessing something like this - so unfortunately, i can only tell you what i saw with my own eyes.\r\n\r\nafter telling my husband and son about my experience, my son showed me pictures of a stealth bomber, which was not what i saw in the sky.  they also showed me pictures of chinese lanterns, but the lights that i saw did not resemble chinese lanterns whatsoever. i also was shown pictures of an aurora fighter plane - again, no resemblance at all to what i witnessed. if anything, when the object would sort of fade away, and as crazy as it sounds, it almost reminded me of the movie, predator, with that same kind of waviness and morphlike appearance.\r\n\r\nthis was such an unnerving experience for me. in some ways, i wish i had never witnessed it because i can't get the image of it out of my mind. i only wish there was some explanation for it, or that someone else has also seen something similar, which is why i'm posting my story. i had actually called the nufron hotline and the person i spoke to told me to contact the city newspaper. i was very hesitant to do that as i want to remain anonymous - i would most certainly be labeled crazy. i know how incredible this may sound, but it is the total truth. i'm still shaken up after witnessing this. i look at the sky differently now.  i know what i saw, no doubt about it.  and i can tell you, without hesitation, that this was most definitely not an airplane. the enormous size of it was no match for an airplane.  i have no idea what it was that i witnessed in the sky that night.

called mummy mountain. at sunset we pitched a tent about 500 feet from the summit of the mountain.  at about midnight or 1 o'clock in the morning i woke up to use the bathroom i noticed there was a flashlight walking down from the summit towards us so i woke up my friend and i said there is someone coming down the mountain. we were nervous because we were way off the trail and i did not have a backcountry permit so i said it must be a ranger somehow he knows we're camping up here now we're going to get a fine. so my friend and i watch this light which looked just like a flashlight and it came down towards us from the mountain and when it got about a hundred feet from us it stopped then as we watched this flashlight what appeared to be a flashlight went straight up from the ground vertically into the air and we watch this thing fly out of sight. it was just a white circular orb look exactly like a person carrying a flashlight but we couldn't see the person we only saw this light. it was probably about three or four feet off the ground and we were astonished as we watch this like take off vertically go straight up in the air and disappear out of sight. after we saw that we were terrified and we got back in their tent and we felt like we had been drugged. we couldn't really speak correctly everything was hazy and it really felt like we had been taking sleeping pills for some type of drug that made us very drowsy and not able to think clearly. i think we fell into a deep sleep and then at about 8 o'clock in the morning it started raining and hailing so we started down the mountain to get out of the storm. as we were going down the mountains we ran into these men there were 4 of them on horseback in camouflage army fatigues and they were following us on their horses. they followed us for about two miles and they stayed about 100 or 200 feet behind us after about 1 hour of them following us one of them rolled up to us and you said how are you how are you guys doing, are you guys okay? we say yes we're fine only follow us for about another hour until we reached the bottom of the trail. it took us about 6 hours from the bottom of the trail to get to my car and when we got in my car the radio would not turn off. the radio in my car was randomly switching stations. we drove about a half an hour down the mountain and went to a gas station to get gas but none of the pumps would work in there was no electricity so we went across the street to wendy to try to get some food and the doors were locked and there was a note scrawled onto a napkin that was hanging in the front window of the door of wendy sorry we're closed and we can look inside and we saw some employees in there it look like they were hiding from us. when we got back home my friend noticed he had a very strange diamond shape my friend noticed very strange diamond shaped depression in the skin of his right shoulder and as we started talking about the events he said he had a dream that night that the aliens had taken a chunk out of his arm. more time to pass by the more he seemed to think that's something actually did happen and he believes that the aliens came down and took something out of his arm. i wanted to report this a long time ago but everybody we talk to thought we made it up. the only thing i saw was that flashlight looking object go straight up into the air and my radio wouldn't turn off in my car and the nearest town had no electricity but the funny thing is ever since that happened every time i'm driving with my friend and we go under a streetlight the street lights will turn off just as we passed under each of them and this happens to this day all the time don't know if there's more to the story or not but it was definitely a very strange experience and my friend seems to have like psychological problem is from this he's terrified of us all isn't everytime we talk about it he almost cries but it didn't really affect me that way i just

suddenly i noticed up in the sky towards the east and about 500-600 ft. up, a very sparkly, shiny object flipping around in the breeze. i could not make out what it was, but it appeared to be elongated and had colorful blinking lights. i then noticed directly above my head floating at a higher altitude, another one, also blinking. both objects did not appear to be going anywhere - other than just sitting up in the sky flipping around.\r\n\r\ni called to my mother to come outside and see it, but she was hesitant because she had stuff on the stove; so i had to physically lead her out to see the shiny objects. after a few minutes of watching, snapping photos and video from my phone, and still not being able to ascertain exactly what the objects were, i asked my mom if i could use her bird-watching binoculars to better make out the shape and to see what was causing all of the flickering and reflective light bouncing off of it.\r\n\r\ni looked at the object through the binoculars, and could easily make out that it was some kind of fancy, high tech, weather balloon! it had an odd shaped balloon like shape on the top and what looked like a yellow or white light attached to the very top of the balloon part. the balloon was very shiny and reflective and appeared silver with an orange-ish shine to it. it also had a long line hanging from it that fishtailed in the breeze. attached to that, was a shiny canister or cylinder shaped object. the cylinder reminded me of a giant silver coffee can with its label stripped off of it. the cylinder also had red and blue blinking lights on it. \r\n\r\nmy mom went in to finish dinner and i decided to go to the front yard where my dad was working to show it to him. i lost track of the other balloon over head, but spotted the lower altitude one, which had drifted slightly more east and a bit higher. my dad and i watched it for a few minutes discussing it (we used to launch homemade hot air balloons in a nearby park many, many years ago). \r\n\r\nthen, as i was viewing the balloon through the binoculars and my dad was just watching it with his eyes – he had his glasses on, i suddenly saw a very bright white ball approaching it from behind, coming up fast. the bright ball approached not in a straight line, but in a very slight  “s” curve. then it slowed down, appearing to keep a respectful distance from the balloon, then flew half way around the balloon and slowed down again hovering next to it. as this was happening, i hear my dad say; “i’m having trouble figuring out which one to look at, but one of them is flying around the other kind of sporadically- it keeps moving!”. i say to my dad, while looking through the binoculars; “no, one is the balloon, and that is a ball of light flying around it! are you seeing what i’m seeing?!” (the white ball of light was moving around the balloon in a way that reminded me of the way a humming bird hovers when it’s checking out flowers!) my dad then replied; “yes, i see it!” i lowered the binoculars and tried to hand them to my dad, but he said he could see both objects just fine without the binoculars!\r\n\r\ni looked back up at the objects through the binoculars to re-focus on the balloon and ball of light, but as i did, the ball of light took off over the direction of our heads - and the balloon was still rising and getting harder to see. just then, my mother called us in for dinner, so we both returned to the house. as we were walking in i said to my dad: “what do you think that ball of light was that was flying around the balloon?” he replied; “i don’t know, but it sure seemed “other worldly” and it seemed to be checking it out (the balloon) just like we were!”\r\n\r\nof course, i didn’t get pictures or video of the white ball of light; i just never expected to see anything other than a balloon! (i have video and pictures of the balloon only, but instead, included a sketch with this report illustrating what we saw when the white ball appeared).\r\n\r\nin conclusion, my dad and i were commenting later that if someone had seen those giant weather or meteorology balloons with the blue and red blinking lights at night time, and with the light on top, they would have perhaps thought that they were seeing ufos! but in any case, we cannot explain the white ball of light that seemed to be checking out the weather balloon along with us!\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

at the stars like i do most every night.  i sat on my porch step, which faces north and looks out over the lake, driveway and trees.  we live on 150 acres and sit up off the road on a hill.  our driveway is narrow, gravel and .09 miles long.  you can’t see most of it because there are woods on both sides. when i look out at night all i can see when i face this way are the silhouettes of the trees against the sky. \r\n\r\ni had been sitting just a few minutes when i noticed a soft white glow at the back of the tree line straight down the middle of the driveway.  to me it appeared as if it would be coming from where our driveway met the road.  it had to be powerful and tall for me to be able to see from our house though because you never see anything from the road from the house we are just to high up.  i thought maybe it could be a big utility vehicle working on the road because there are parts of many of the gravel roads in the area that are washing away from all of the rain.  i watched for a moment and then it appeared to me that it was a bit closer.  i decided that i should come in the house and put on shoes in case someone came up and needed to talk to me.  i watched the front window while i was putting on my shoes to see if i noticed lights coming up the driveway but i didn’t notice any.\r\n\r\nusing caution because i’m home alone, i slowly opened the door and peeked out to see if there was anyone outside.  there was not.  so i walked over to my spot again on the step and sat down.  i don’t remember if i saw the glow, but the next thing i saw was a huge bright white light, almost blindingly bright, and multifaceted.  it was right above the tree line, centered on the driveway.  i could not see the tree line where this light was.  it blocked everything.  then as quickly as it had burst bright white, it burst bright red but seemed to be closer when it did.  i stood up, then saw it burst to bright white, then bright red.  each time it switched to the other color it appeared to lurch forward towards me.  at this point i felt as if it were coming directly toward me and felt threatened.  i ran in the house, grabbed my cell phone and the land line and called 911 while sending a text to my husband telling him to come home from work.  i prayed that i would get through to someone before i lost power or became unable to use the phone.  i was terrified, shaking all over and had a hard time breathing.  this isn’t normal for me.  i’m the curious type, i like to check things out and don’t scare easily.  i am out here alone most of the time and have never been afraid like i was that night.  i stayed on the phone with the police dispatcher for 45 minutes until a deputy arrived.  he was wonderful and investigated the driveway and the area around the house and found nothing.  he did not make me feel silly for calling and said to call if i saw anything that made me uncomfortable again no matter how insignificant i thought it might be.  i came in the house when he left, made sure every light i had was on, surrounded myself with every weapon i had (4 of them, it just made me feel better) and sat afraid to move from the spot i was in, for the next 2 ½ hours until my husband got home.\r\n\r\ni’m not the best judge of distance but before writing this i went and looked where i saw this happen to give you my best guess at the distance it traveled.  i did this in the daylight and with help from my husband.  starting with the glow i saw first, it would have been just under a mile from my front step, at the end of the driveway coming from below the tree line.  in my estimation the first burst of bright white light was around the halfway point so it would have been about half a mile from my house.  i pointed to where i saw the last burst of light, which was red and asked my husband to tell me how far from me.  he has a spot marked in that area to sight in gun; it is 200 yards from the house.  he said where i was pointing would be about 230 yards from my front door.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

tennessee.  it was still the fall of 1973 and was either late october or early november.   that night my family had gone to a near by country club for dinner and i had kept a lot of the crackers from the table and placed them on a shelf in my room.   at this age i was afraid to go to sleep with the doors closed and so i had my parents keep the door open after they tucked me in for bed. \r\n\r\ni woke up later that night with a craving to eat the crackers i had saved and placed on a shelf in my room.  the lamp beside my bed was either on or i turned it on.   but my room was lit with the light from the hallway and from the light in my room.  i sat on the floor next to the shelf and began to open up the crackers, but i was having trouble taking off the plastic wrapper.  then i felt something very strange. \r\n\r\nthe first sensation was a feeling like heat on my back.  then i heard a pulsing humming sound.  i looked up and could see a shadow on my door from someone in the hallway.  the sensations then intensified and i became afraid.  i ran back to my bed and curled up in a ball and closed my eyes.  my next thought was \"oh i should have covered myself with my blanket.\"   i then felt fingers touching me and the pulsing humming sound was very loud.   then the sensation quickly stopped.  i opened my eyes and looked around an empty room. \r\n\r\ni cautiously went to the doorway to my room and looked in the hallway.  it was empty.  so i went across the hall to my parents dark room.  it was lit from the light from the hallway and from some dull orange light from a clock on a table closest to the door on my mother's side of the bed.  it was very dark towards my father's side of the bed and i was too scared to go over there.  so i shook my mom whispering \"mom.  mom.  wake up.\"   she would not wake up.   then i felt again that heat sensation on my back, and i could hear the same pulsing humming sound.   i curled up on the floor.  this time i kept my eyes open.  i looked over at a dresser with a mirror on top, and observed a small figure come out of the wall.  it looked greyish in the shadows and i could see it had a large head and big black eyes.   i then closed my eyes but not before i saw some feet move close to me.  then i felt fingers touching me again.  they reached around my head.  one of the fingers slipped into my mouth and i then bit down on it as hard as i could.   i recall it was soft and not like my own fingers.   it had a spongy rubbery texture to it.  i then blacked out.     \r\n\r\nthe next morning i was still in my parents room.  i then yelled \"there was a grey tickle monster in my room!\"  i would not go back into my room till my dad looked all around.  the whole experience was terrifying for me.   then my parents said i had to get ready for school. \r\n\r\ni think in part i remember this experience so well from so long ago is because i told it over and over beginning that morning to other children in the car pool on the way to pre-school.   there were three other children with me in the car.  two of them did not believe my story, but the third little girl said she knew what i was talking about.  she lived across the

between them was large & to my eyes never changed. it was moving very slowly. duration was two hours. about 45 minutes in i glanced north & i saw a lone object hovering about the mountain line of n salt lake city. it's lights were clearly visible. it looked from my angle to be a line of lights that were rapidly lighting up in a line, strobing across it. the lights were red, blue, yellow, green, white & in fast sequence. whereas the triangle floated west out of view slowly disappearing the lone one just disappeared. i looked down, looked up & it was gone. i tried repeatedly to get pictures and video but my phone couldn't capture what i was seeing. i tweeted about the whole event on my twitter feed as it happened if you want to read the play by play as it happened. i was tagging slc utah for others to go look. one other person seemed to have seen it as well. the day of the 15th i found another person who had posted a video (much better than mine) on youtube. you can see the pulsing lights although to my eye on that night i could see the line of lights of the one over the mountain. the triangle shape one was just a blur of pulsing color. i've since been trying to eliminate what it wasn't ie gas, weather balloons and so forth. my reaction to the sighting was that it was cool, if military they suck at hiding since the lights were bright & attention grabbing. lol watched the skies for decades now & never seen anything i could truly not reason away. that's not to say this can't be, but i can't come up with a possible known explanation.\r\n\r\nthe next night, last night between 2-4:30 am i looked again & saw 5 lighted objects scattered across the valley. one was over the mountain again as the night before but farther away. all the objects were farther & all i could see was the flashing of color. i just went to bed, no idea how they left from view. they again, to my view were hovering & would disappear from view with clouds. 2 i could see through the cloud coverage. \r\n\r\nthe video posted on youtube of the one on the 15th can be found by googling utah ufo 15-6-15 (think that was the title). i'm sorry my photos & video are so bad. the photo on my twitter shows 3 points of light when zooming in. that's the triangle. my twitter is rikkie wells and handle is @zbanshee if you want to read the play by play. i also posted the youtube video i found. \r\n\r\nlet me know if you have any questions & i'd suggest someone from the utah chapter go outside tonight between 2:30 & 5:30 am with a good camera. :)\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\n[name

then blackness started in the center of the object and spread out until the object was gone. the whole sighting didn't last more than about eight or ten seconds with it disappearing in about 1 second. i first thought that some clouds must have passed over it so i continued to look. then i realized i could see stars and that there were were no clouds in that direction. i waited about a minute to see if it would reappear but the only other thing i saw was a streak of bright light about 3 degrees to the right of the original sighting. i took the second sighting to be a meteorite. the brightest star in the sky where i saw the phenomena was hamal but the sighting was much bigger and brighter. there was no sound.\r\nlater in the day i took a photo of the sky where i saw the phenomena and put a lens
