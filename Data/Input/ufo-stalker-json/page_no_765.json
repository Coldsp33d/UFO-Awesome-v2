on highway 50. i have large family and everyone at one time or another lived in lake tahoe and the bay area so in my life time i have traveled that route many many times. we left tahoe around 11 pm after my father got off work, we were in his vw van. it's a twisty 2 lane highway that starts hi up the mountain then levels out as you descend. this night we saw an unusual amount of animal activity. sometimes you might see a couple deer or a raccoon when they cross the highwy to get to the river. this night we saw more deer, squirrels, a couple of raccoons a couple owls, more than i ever saw in all my trips. we were all commenting on it, my dad said maybe there was a bear or mountain lion in the area that had them all spooked. as you get lower you have the river on one side and you're up against the mountain on the other side. then you eventually come to a section where the mountain is behind you and the highway is above and the landscape falls away on both sides into deep valleys. at that point the forest is below you. in those days and at that time of year there isn't hardly any people. there's cabins and campgrounds but at this time they are closed up for the winter so there' only a couple small communities that people live at all year but that is still 20 -30 miles farther down the highway, pollack pines, soda springs then placerville about 50 miles away. \r\nso we notice the animals first then when we're near where you're finally off the mountain going towards where the highway is above the valley and we can see a really bright light thru the trees. we come around the bend and see this huge super bright ball of light moving slowly over the valley coming our direction. it's still about 10 miles away but it's big, it has a beam of light coming from it like a spotlight shining down on the forest below. my dad pulls over and we all get out. my cousin was about 8 he was asleep until we pulled over. my aunt says don't say it's a ufo he'll be scared, she told him to get back in the van. my father and i walked across the highway to look at it better. there was a full moon that night and it was kind of overcast. this ball was below the clouds. the size was as if you held out at arms length in you fingers a dime in one hand and a 50 cent piece in the other, the moon was the dime. there was no noise at all. it had to be really big because it was still about 10 miles down from us and about 5 miles off to that side of the road. they didn't have helicopter cops in use in those days and there is no one around up there anyway. my father had served on an aircraft carrier and was saying that that wasn't anything humans would fly. i had never seen anything that bright, i didn't know about fluorescent lights then but it was brighter than any i've seen since. it was slowly moving across the valley with this beam lighting up the forest below. we watched it for about 5-10 minutes, then it stopped and about 10 seconds later the beam went off then it just shot away upwards and to the west instantly in a split second blink of an eye it was gone. where it had stopped and then took off the clouds were gone like a circle as if the heat of it had burned them away and you could see the clear sky. now this is the weird part, i don't remember going back across the road, getting in the van, the rest of the trip. i don't remember ever telling anyone about it or talking about it with my dad or aunt. 20 some years later i was visiting my aunt and asked her to describe her memory of the event without saying what i remembered. she told it exactly like i just did here and when i asked my dad he said the exact same thing. even my cousin remembers it this way and he only watched from the window of the van. i have seen several t.V programs that reenacted this type of sighting by other people and it's described like what i saw. this thing was huge, it couldn't be man made, it had to be a thousand feet wide at least, it was at least 10 or more miles from us and was 10 times the size of the full moon. i always wondered if any other travelers or forest rangers or maybe someone living nearby also saw it. if you were on that hiway that night you couldn't have missed it.

hill road to the south and e 233rd. st. to the north, and between willett avenue to the east and the bronx park to the west. the sighting which i am reporting here for the first time in detail, occurred during the summer of 1985, one day before i was to move from the bronx, new york to san antonio, texas with both of my parents.  school had just let out for the year and my friends and i were saying our goodbyes and throwing a baseball around in the bronx park, across the street from the six-story apartment building in which we lived.  there were about five of us kids throwing \"grounders & pop-ups\" to each other, while several of our parents stood by talking and just hanging out.  my parents, and four other adults were there.  five of them (my parents included) stood talking near the street, while a friend's mother sat at \"the monument\", an approximately 15-20 foot tall obelisk-like stone structure with a 6 sided base facing the park.  across from \"the monument\" is \"the horseshoe\", a stone entryway in the shape of its namesake, with stone steps leading down to another level of the park below street level.  going after a \"pop-up\", i raised my glove and eyes skyward (south east) and noticed \"heat-lightning\" flashing just over my building's rooftop.  catching the ball, i pointed this out to my friends who were amazed to see it as well.  what struck me as odd was that it was a nice evening with no clouds, and that the flashes of light were only above and just behind, the rooftop.  there was no thunder, only light.  no lightning bolts or streaks, just massive flashes of light, and only above and behind my building's rooftop.  the light spread over a great area, but nowhere else in the sky was this happening.  this occurred for several long minutes during which time the flashes would stop and start, but then as kids will do, we went back to playing catch.  i noticed after a little while that it seemed to have stopped... then i saw it.  from behind the building an object moved very slowly over the rooftop about 50-100 feet above it, and coming in our direction it slowly descended from the six-story height of the building, down over the park and our heads, to about a third-story height (approximately 60 feet or so).  as it slowly passed over head i saw what i could only describe as a \"flying-tank\".  everyone (and everything) was silent then.  our parents, us kids, the craft... all silent.  then it passed over \"the horseshoe\" and hovered for a minute or so -which felt like forever!  the lower level of the park sits about 20 feet, more or less, lower than street level.  leading down from \"the horseshoe\", the stone steps bring you to a paved path running north-south, and just below the path there is a depression in a clearing approximately 100-150' feet in diameter, next to a fenced in playground area.  into this depression it descended.  the craft appeared dark grey and black in the night sky, illuminated by the street lamps nearby, with many shapes (squares/rectangles/tube-like structures) visible along the bottom and sides.  there were no particular patterns visible, and it appeared to be made from giant lego blocks.  there were no visible lights or windows, just this huge, dark, hulking, silent craft.  as it descended, it dipped below the treetops and into the clearing where we would play baseball.  the craft now below us, the field erupted in white light, as though lit by the lights at yankee stadium.  lit from beneath, every tree seamed to cast shadows straight up into the night sky as the explosion of light weaved through them.  i believe that the craft touched down at this point (though admittedly, the craft was obscured at this point, by blinding light), because there was no movement by the shadows ie. the scene appeared static.  we amazed at this for a minute or so... that was all we could stand.  my friends and i shared the briefest of glances, as well as the unspoken \"we've gotta see this!\" and ran for \"the horseshoe\" to go down and have a look.  \"nooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!\"  the scream pierced the night and stabbed right through me.  my friend's mother, sitting at \"the monument\", screamed as though she were being ripped apart -it was blood-curdling!  we froze in place transfixed by her warning.  just then the light went off like a switch and slowly the craft ascended to about ten or fifteen feet above tree level, hovered there for a moment, then began to wobble?, gyrate?  it was like a toy spinning top as it looses its speed and begins to wobble just before it comes crashing down.  now imagine that... but upside down.  it made three complete counter-clockwise gyrations then shot off in a \"right dog-leg\" following the park's path first one block north, then another thirteen blocks and beyond to the northeast at incredible speed.  we [kids] ran then, regardless of any protests the one block to the north, and coming around the bend in the park could see (it's a straight shot), beyond the thirteen blocks that signaled the end of the bronx park... \"heat-lighting\" in the night sky.  walking back to our block, all of my friends were extremely excited saying,\"what was that!?! and,\"did you see that!?!  my walk back was in silence.  like them, i too did not know what it was.  like them, i too witnessed it; however, unlike them (to the best of my knowledge) i am the only one who had seen it before.  in 1979 at the age of eleven, just six blocks down and two blocks over from where this sighting took place, on a bright sunny afternoon a \"flying-tank\" (dubbed this from the army men toys i played with as a child -granade throwing, bazooka firing, flame-thrower toting, radio operating, prone position shooting army men, and yes... tanks! my favorite! plenty of war flicks with my pop too!) which was to me at the time, the biggest thing my young mind could conceive of.  it followed me, floating just overhead in complete silence, for over half a block as i walked towards my two brothers and a bunch of friends playing in the street.  it cut a big black square hole in the clear blue sky.  as i approached them i turned and pointed,\"look\" i said, but it was gone.  this occurred the day before my family moved from there, to the building across from the bronx park -but i digress.  upon returning to \"the monument\" i asked my friend's mother, whom was so close to my family that we called her my aunt,\"why did you screem?  why didn't you let us go look at it?\"  to which she replied,\"look at what?  i didn't screem, what are you talking about?  go play.\"  my own parents either refuse to face or truly don't recall, the incident.  my best friend growing up was there that night, we lost touch shortly after i moved away, but in 2011 i tracked him down and like my parents he too either refuses to face what really happened that night in 1985 or doesn't remember it.  for me, now at the thirty-year anniversary of the event, my recollection is as clear as if it happened today.  there is so much more, missing time, a scoop mark, bits and pieces that i can no longer ignore... a long history hidden in my head; yet, for all that i suspect i've been through, this is the first time i reach out to seek answers for what i have seen and what i have experienced.  why did it appear each time i moved?  why is it that i am the only one who remembers this?  is this their way of saying we always know where you are?  another thing that has just now taken me aback is that, using google earth to verify landmark directions, i found what looks like a \"white tree\" where i believe this craft landed, where all others trees throughout the entire park are green only.  anyway, i believe this is a good first step.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with

the ota was not outside. it was in what used to be a helicopter hanger because the school had previously been for helicopter mechanics. the ota used to be outside but when they moved it - they kept the name. that's the army for you. after we spent a few weeks training in the \"ota\" learning how to operate gte's \"mobile subscriber equipment\" under the guidance of two civilian (but prior military) instructors - we moved into an area which actually was outside, but they didn't call it the \"outside training area\", it was simply called \"the antenna field\". you can see this field in the movie \"heartbreak ridge\" with clint eastwood - they shot part of the movie there at what was then housing for mi. or if you want precise longitude and lattidude coordinates, here it is: 33°24'15.53\"n 82° 8'18.27\"w fort gordon is a really beautiful base, it's kind of nestled in the middle of the woods in georgia and during the weekends when we'd get time off i would sometimes go hiking far off into the hills - it was absolutely beautiful. the air force uses the base also for communications training and on a few of my expeditions on the base i ended up finding huge satellite dishes which i never learned anything about, i just saw them. there was also a lot of military intelligence at gordon (i assume there still is) and it used to crack me up that these dudes thought they were \"hiding\" - maybe they were blending in with the civilian population but they stuck out like a sore thumb on a military base. they're the only ones on the base with long hair and hawaiian shirts - how much more obvious can you get!? i have so many stories from my time at fort gordon including the time i got so drunk at the nco club that i threw up in the taxi on the way back to the barracks; got kicked out of the taxi and had to walk back - i didn't even know which way was up and didn't think i'd make it back. somehow i did. then there's the story about drill sergeant \"n\". it was a monday morning and there had been rumors that a soldier had been killed in an accident over the weekend. we all thought that it was a soldier in training from a different battalion, but around 8am our entire company was called into a \"horse shoe\" formation and introduced to the family of drill sergeant lisa lorrain \"n\". they told us she had been killed in a car accident and the entire company broke into tears. i never thought i'd see a drill sergeant cry but they all did. and we weren't even given time to grieve - we marched from that formation straight to school and were told to \"maintain your military bearing\" and continue forward with training as if nothing had happened. they told us the same thing at her memorial service - \"maintain your military bearing... you know that if drill sergeant \"n\" saw you crying right now she'd have you on the ground in the front leaning rest position\". but then they did the roll call. the command sergeant major called out the names of all drill sergeants in the company - each one replied. then he called out the name \"drill sergeant \"n\"\"..... silence. \"drill sergeant \"n\"\".......... again, silence. \"drill sergeant.... \"n\"\" and then we heard one solitary bugle in the back of the room playing taps. i'd done well to maintain my military bearing up till that point but i f**king lost it. so did our other drill sergeant who had told us to \"maintain your military bearing\". after the ceremony the entire class was formed up (into a formation) outside and marched in silence to school. we were given \"route step march\" which means stay in formation but you can just walk - and we cried all the way to school. then sat in class crying and telling stories about drill sergeant \"n\". a few days later we were doing pt in the morning and our other drill sergeant marched us to the training field with the same cadence that drill sergeant \"n\" used to always march us with: \"when i go... go down town.... don't you kick my dog around....\" we got through two or three verses and the drill sergeants voice cracked. he stopped - we walked in silence the rest of the way fighting back tears. there was one other particular day in which is was also hard to maintain our \"military bearing\". we were learning to install a type of antenna called a \"chu\" antenna. i never found out what \"chu\" stands for but i spent eight years installing them. we were almost done with our installation on one night - it was around 8pm and dark outside but this big field had large powerful lights going all the way around it so we had plenty of light, but could still see the stars. it takes 3 soldiers to install one antenna and we had several groups with several antennas scattered around the field (about 30 soldier/students and 2 civilian instructors - employees of general dynamics). so we were almost done when i heard pvt shaw (standing to my right) screaming at the top of his lungs \"look at that f**king ufo!!!!!\". believe it or not, my first thought was \"i can't believe he's using that kind of language around our civilian instructors - so much for military bearing\" and then it registered in my brain what he'd actually said. so i looked up and saw a huge... very bright light; moving at speeds that would be impossible in any conventional aircraft i know of and making no sound at all. it was flying directly over my head. i got yelled at by one of our civilian instructors for looking at it (actually for taking my eyes off the antenna). he yelled \"mcphalen!!! pay attention to what your doing!!!\". so i looked back down just long enough to lock my cable anchor back into place (literally a split second; faster than it takes you to read the words \"down;up\") and when i looked back up the thing was gone. i spent the next two weeks looking at the sky wondering what that thing was or if i'd ever see it again. and nobody wanted to talk about it - the guy that yelled \"look at that f***ing ufo\" suddenly changed his story and started saying it was a \"weather balloon\" (i guess he likes getting promoted). nobody talked to me after the incident - i never had any \"men in black\" suits show up at the barracks and tell me look into a flashy shiney thing or tell me not to talk about what i saw. so i reported it to mufon (13 years later) and have been talking about it ever since it happened. during the nights that followed i spent a lot of time thinking about what i'd seen & watching the skies. on one occasion we were working on a different type of antenna - much larger and much more dangerous but we had fewer of them and only two groups got to train at a time. so every couple of nights our group (one of three) would sit it out in a large field tent for the whole training night! eight hours, we'd just sit and watch movies (most crappy) and eat either chinese food or pizza. the chinese food sucked; the pizza was awesome - but i was still going outside every few hours just too look up at the sky (after getting bored with the horrible movies). i was looking up and saw what looked like a bright star where it didn't belong - in the middle of the orion constellation. i know the constellations pretty well, i'm a member of friends of the observatory (griffith) and have been into astronomy since i was a kid; i even have star charts and a droid app for astronomy. but anyway (tmi)... i knew that this \"star\" didn't belong in that spot. i also knew that it wasn't venus because it wasn't in the right place / right time. so i gauged it's position in the sky by leaning against the guard rail to lock in my own position and see where it sat across the telephone wires. over the hours i watched orion move across the sky, but this thing never moved. toward the end of the night orion was already on the horizon - and this thing was still in the same spot. if it had been a planet it would have been moving faster than the stars - not slower or no movement at all. so about an hour before the class was over - i went back outside again to look at this thing again (it was there for about 5 hours, just sitting there in the sky). even if it was a ufo... how long can you stare at a ufo that's not doing anything? so i'd go back inside; eat pizza; watch movies; go back outside - it's still sitting there; go back inside etc. but close to the end i went out and the thing was gone but there were about 7 or 8 black hawk helicopters flying around the area where it had previously been (it wasn't even there any more) but not passing through the space where the thing had been sitting. and the helicopters never went anywhere near it while it was in the sky.... kinda weird. a few nights after that - same type of situation with the sky; except it was a weekend. there was no training and i was sitting outside the px (33°25'28.03\"n 82° 8'18.04\"w) having a beer and a slice of pizza and reading by myself. every now and then i'd put the book down and look up at the sky. i eventually noticed an object similar to the other one (probably took me a little longer to spot it because i'd already had a few beers by this point). i don't remember if it was in the middle of orion, i was a bit tipsy and didn't bother to take note of it's precise location. but there it was - just sitting there; not moving; in just about the same area of sky. i sat there in that spot reading for probably five hours and that thing sat there in the sky for longer than that because eventually i literally got bored with it - so i finished my book; beer & pizza; went back to the barracks and went to sleep. never saw it again. \r\n\r\nthis happened 13 years ago and i still think about it almost every single day. i don't think there's a single day that goes by that i don't look up at the sky at least once. the event did not scare me at all but filled me with wonder and awe. one interesting fact that i have discovered recently (today in fact) is that at some point in time between my sighting and present day, the nsa opened up a facility roughly two miles to the west of where we had this sighting (a very interesting; curved building). it is clearly visible on google earth and is even labeled as an nsa facility. to the best of my knowledge this facility wasn't there in 1999. the object came from the west of where i was standing; just minutes ago i was exploring the area to the west of where we had our sighting and there appears to be a hanger of some sort nestled deep in the woods - directly to the west of where the sighting occurred and almost exactly south of the nsa facility (but slightly to the east). it's definitely worth a look if you have google earth, some of the surrounding terrain appears to have been digitally manipulated (area 51 is clearer on google earth than some of the areas surrounding thomas lake which is also to the west of where the sighting occured). \r\n\r\nunfortunately we were not allowed to take cameras into the area in which we were training because the equipment we were working on was classified (that's not always as interesting as it sounds - it's just communications equipment). but i have attached one image from google maps which has a letter \"x\" marking the exact location where i was standing at the time of the sighting. i also have pictures of my entire training class and our instructors standing in front of the gte resident school (as it was called at that time - i think it's now called the \"verizon resident school) but it would probably be inappropriate to upload that image.

size, shape and color travelling in an elliptical pattern underneath the other 3.  i was looking over a piece of equipment set out about 200' and standing 60' high, the objects were over the top of it but at a distance undetermined from the equipment and at an elevation that put it above the equipment if directly over the top would have been 20 to 30' above.  i was wearing polarized safety glasses.  i at first thought them to be birds but realized quickly that they were not moving, except for the one that continued to go in circles under the other 3.  i had a radio and called to other people on location to see if they could see them, none of them could see them.  i walked over to them and none of them were wearing sunglasses.  i pointed at the objects and described what i was seeing, still none of them could see them.  i took my glasses off and gave them to one of the other people there and pointed out what i was seeing.  with the naked eye, i could only really see just a small flash as the sun reflected off of them when they would move slightly and the one doing circles, could only see when it came around closer to us in direction and then could not see it on the back side of the circle.  the guy i gave my glasses to could still not see them, i took the glasses back and as they started to ridicule me i saw the object at the top of the triangle shape come down to the one doing circles and go around it in a circle but top to bottom around the other one.  it then shot back into formation and the one doing the circles the entire time then formed up so the formation took on a diamond shape.  they appeared to shudder for a moment then shot off to the west faster than any aircraft could have from a hover position.  about 5 minutes later a jet entered the area along the same track that the objects had moved off in.  the jet was higher than i normally see commercial aircraft and can only suspect it was military in nature.  i did not see the objects the rest of the day and took quite a bit of joking from the rest of the crew.  i laughed it off with them, but inside, felt and still feel that i had seen something and when watching them i can honestly say after reflection that i had no feelings at all, like my mind was just blank.  i know i saw them, i am not crazy.  i wish i had a camera on me, but there is no evidence other than my statement.","distance":"Over One
