(side note, we were seven miles from main-side and at least 10+ miles from the nearest road.  the base was 100% surrounded by a barbed-wire fence as well.  my point is there is no way anyone or anything could get out there without being spotted; a car, truck or jeep would easily leave a dust trail and be heard, the desert is not easy to navigate and walking is out of the question!). when you googleearth 29 palms and go to camp wilson you'll see where i'm talking about.\r\n\r\nso i was an e4 corporal and assigned to guard-duty at camp wilson.  i grabbed several buddies of mine and we got a driver and headed out for the night.  i had (as i recall; harry, butch, willy, and ? driver...?  don't recall) with me.  we made a fire and ate \"c-rats\" and sat around shooting the bull...\r\n\r\nafterward we had metal folding chairs and we leaned them up against the side of the hut and sat back to watch nothing but desert....  guard duty is a long and boring duty, but we were all great friends and had each other to keep us occupied and amused.\r\n\r\nbtw; to set the record straight now, there was absolutely no drugs or alcohol involved whatsoever; it is a serious offense leading to nasty consequences!\r\n\r\nso after maybe half an hour of sitting back and staring at the horizon and mountain range several miles in the distance (it was now fully dark out) we we noticed a red light flip on as if someone had turned on a switch.  it just appeared!  no one said a word...  at first we just assumed it was a helo (helicopter) on night maneuvers... but suddenly it moved left to right in a nanosecond covering several miles.  \"did you see that...?\" one of us said...  \"hell yea! what was it...?\"  \"i dunno... maybe a helo...?\"  \"nfw, a helo can't move that fast!\"  then as quickly it shot back to the original point; literally in the blink of an eye it moved!  on a good day, with the wind at it's back a helo takes several seconds to move that distance, and not from a dead-stop!  this happened a couple times and although we were probably a couple miles we didn't hear a sound!\r\n\r\nafter maybe 20-30 minutes the light shot straight up and was gone.  again, a help can't move that fast!  harriers can't move that fast!\r\n\r\nhere's where it gets really weird!  shortly after this light was out-of-sight, one of the 5-ton dump trucks about 20 yards started!  the engine just started!  i mean out of nowhere the engine started!  but there was no one around but me and my guys, and we were all accounted for!  now laugh all you want, but as i said earlier, we were on a secure marine corps base miles from any roads.  and no one in their right mind is going to sneak around the desert at night to start a diesel engine!  we looked for foot prints heading from and to the desert and found nothing!  we looked all over the area and found nothing!  this is a desert, it's not easy to run and hide!  and even if it had been some buddies pulling a prank, they'd have shown themselves after the fun and games had worn off!  no, there was no one there...  i can't stress enough, we were in the middle of nowhere and access was basically limited to one road in and out back them.\r\n\r\nso back to the drugs and alcohol, we never discussed this with anyone simply because we were marines and didn't want to have people thinking we were crazy or had been doing drugs and or booze while on guard duty!  i'll bet to this day the other guys have forgotten it ever happened...\r\n\r\nevery once in awhile i'll be watching something about ufo's and recall my experience in the desert.  totally unexplained....","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":66427,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.6182254,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06142015-0012","longitude":-121.3228877,"occurred":226224000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1434309046000,"summary":"Bright red dot appeared out of nowhere at marine corps base 29 palms ca","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13982,"locationName":"Carmichael, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:28749"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Ponce","country":"PR","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In 1992 in the month of october i was traveling from ponce to san juan using the new highway that was built. it was approximately 9:00 pm. i had been expecting to see a flying saucer all that day as i had purposely gone to the lake cartagena area where there had been frequent sightings but the day went by and nothing happened. as it started getting dark i headed home to san juan. i was still watching the sky on my way home. i saw a red light come out of the clouds to the west and it headed straight for me. i stopped the car on the side of the road to watch the light. the flying saucer vehicle descended and hovered right in front of my vehicle slowly moving from west to east making sure that i got a good look at it.  i continued watching it travel slowly from west to east.When it got far enough away i started on my way home. the vehicle turned and followed me for about 5 minutes then disappeared. it was a larger craft than what i saw in 1973 and it had spinning blades on the bottom. it also had portholes on the dome and different colored lights coming out of the portholes as there is something spinning in the center of the craft. i have reported my previous sighting but i submitted diagrams with this report. the most important thing that i realized is that whomever was guiding this craft knew my thoughts and knew that i was looking to see a flying saucer that day.

this way and that, backwards and forwards, diagonally. they seemed to be playing w each other. i couldnt see any other features other than balls of light. i only felt awe, and fervently hoped and waited for another car to come and verify what i was seeing. after abt 20 mins sisterhooderving them float around, no other cars came and they seemed to be breaking up the meeting, several flew off in their own directions. i decided to follow one. i got back in my car and followed one of the balls of light all the way into town, where it turned east. i followed it east until the edge of town on rt. 72 where i lost sight of it. none of them flew very high, maybe 40 ft off the ground at the highest. i told my grampa of it in the morning and asked him if there was a remote helicopter flying club in the area that would fly them so early. he laughed at me and told me about his own ufo encounter in minnesota in 1940. my sister witnessed almost the exact same thing on the same road in nov 2011 at

room 7428. im standing on my balcony to take a picture of our last sunset, i noticed a black dot on the sun. i took camera down to see with my naked eye what the black dot was. i seen nothing. i then checked the lens of the camera for dirt or any obstructions which there was none. i looked back through my camera at sunset and the dot was still there. i moved camera away from my view to again check sun with my eyes, again i seen nothing. so for few seconds i juggle my sight from naked view of sun to viewing through the camera as i was dumbfounded as to what was happening. i took few photos , then took few of other areas to see if the black dot would show up, it didn't . i then took more of the sun to confirm it was actually there and not my camera. after concerning myself with this i called my wife out to see if she saw anything covering the sun. i didn't mention what i was capturing i just asked if there was anything in the sky or in the sun. all she saw was a beautiful sunset. i then showed her what i was seeing . she as well was dumbfounded. there was no noise. we couldn't see it with naked eye only on the go pro. we sat and watched it for 7_10 minutes, then went back in our rooms as we had dinner reservations. we took pictures almost every sunset but this is nthe only one that we saw this. we were there for 7 days june 5-12.When i got home i immediately downloaded pictures to see if i did indeed capture it and i did. that's when i noticed the red orange orb that was only present in the pictures containing the object.  don't know what this is or could be

boomerang shape to the object.  i had to really look to see this thing as the body of the ship just seemed a dark area in the sky and if you were not trying to see it...You wouldn't.  this ship made no noise, nor wobble, nor shift direction. it was going straight south.  i saw nothing come from it or enter it.  no lights of any kind.  what i saw was a boomerang shaped very very large object going from the north to the south, in what seemed at a very slow speed. once it was going past me i noticed two things...First,  it was in fact going at a fast speed and second it was very very large..Did i already say that.  once it had passed i just stared at the sky wondering if i had really seen something and do i tell anyone.  after a brief period i realized that i had really seen a ufo and that i could not tell anyone. back in the mid 60s one didn't tell anyone of things like this as you would be laughed at and put down..The funny farm for you.  i thought about this event every day for a long time.  i knew i had seen a ufo because 1. the size was far far larger then anything we had or anyone had..I know, ive already said that. 2.Once i realized the speed i knew that anything we have that could go that speed was a jet fighter.  this object was many times larger than a jet fighter(i began to realize it was hundreds of times larger then a fighter..No one had something like this)..Ok i said it again, but it was large.  3. the silence of this ship was even quieter than a blimp...No noise period.  \r\n\r\n   over the next few days i started to wonder many things. where was it going, where did it come from, do we need to be afraid, who was in it, does anyone else know of this, can i tell anyone about this, i really really really want to see this craft up close, in the day time, on the ground.  i want to go inside, go to mars and saturn.  i want to see the people and talk to them. maybe get a gift from them.\r\n\r\n  that was how i felt and do to this day when i think about it.  my hands are shaking and i feel cold.  after 50 yrs i still get goose bumps when thinking about it. still wonder what they were doing and does our government know about them, and should i say anything...Just keep my mouth shout like ive done all these years.\r\n\r\n  i am sorry i could not or would not say anything until now.  i didn't know what would happen to me or my family.  my stepdad scared me, the government scared me a lot more. as i know \"they have very long arms\"\r\n\r\n   i wish i could tell you more but it would be going over the same thing i just told you.  it was dark, the object was dark, it lasted just 5mins or less. thanks for having this site for people like me.  i really hope more people come out.  i want the government to tell the truth, so it bothers some people..Get over it.  the catholic church has even come out and said there are others out there.  we can handle it.  ok then..Just tell me.  let me see those aliens you have and the documents you have and the films.  i wont tell anyone..Really.  like that well ever happen.  \r\n\r\n  thanks again and keep up the great work.  best wishes, dan","distance":"Over One

night, although it wasn't raining at this time.I was sitting at the intersection of peach orchard and bungalow roads, preparing to take a left onto bungalow road.Straight ahead approx. 500 feet peach orchard veers to the right, and all you can see is trees straight ahead.Above the treeline where you lose sight of peach orchard, a disc shaped ufo came floating out of the fog, moving straight down the middle of the road, straight towards my car sitting in the middle turn lane. i estimate the size to be 20 feet because its sides extended halfway into the lanes bordering the middle turn lane. i estimate it was floating 35 feet above the road. it was not spinning. there were red, orange-yellow lights around the perimeter. because the lights shone on the craft itself, i could tell the craft was metallic and was not completely flat.\r\nwhen it got within approx. 35ft of my car, it started to move off to my right. i took a left onto bungalow rd and an immediate right into the lot of a (closed)store facing peach orchard rd. it was straight ahead from this position and i tried to find my cell to take a picture. but i lost sight of it when it started to descend below the roof line of a business. i could have quickly traveled across the road to see if it landed behind the building, but whether out of fear or something else-all i remember feeling/thinking was 'i have seen what i was meant to see' and i proceeded to work. i didn't say anything about what i saw for some time.What really blows my mind is this ufo presented itself in the middle of a good sized city, 35 ft. above the road!However, the fact i was the only one at that intersection at that time is in itself highly strange.","distance":"21-100
