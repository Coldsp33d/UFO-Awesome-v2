looked around to see if something spooked her. i looked up and saw this object drop out of the sky and stopped dead, it didn't slow down. it just stopped and hovered about 500 feet away from me, and about 700 feet from me, and hovering about 3 buildings from my home. i didn't hear anything, smell anything, i did however feel a buzz like sensation. i honestly thought something was going to happen to me, my adrenaline was pumping hard and it took everything in me not to run and stand as still as possible. which is not me, i am a very curious person and want to figure out any mystery that i come across. it has served me well mny of times, but has also been a disservice at times. i thought i was going to get abducted, hurt or god forbid killed. after a few (seemingly) seconds i remembered i had my phone on me and went to grab it. however, i noticed the phone (moto g) was very, very slow (also not typical, i pride myself on keeping my computers and such in optimal running condition), after a few seconds i got the camera app running and snapped a few pictures after the he 4th or 5th the phone shut off and over heated. the vessle then out of no where shot west towards the gulf of mexico. i didn't see it after then. the dog calms down and looks at me like if she was saying (can we go the hell home now), and we run home. i get home and my wife asks me where have i been. she says i was gone for almost a half an hour. i don't think i was abducted, i think i got so lost in the moment that i lost track of time. i tried to get my phone back on, but she wouldn't boot. i opened the back up and the battery was hot as hell. the battery shorted out.

spending the night at my house.  our town was so small that there were only a few kids that lived there and everyone was in their houses after dark, watching tv, or in bed.  for entertainment that night, we walked 1.5 city blocks from my house, crossed the empty highway to go to the only place still open,maybe between 9-11pm.  after playing pin ball, and buying sodapops, we crossed the highway again; no traffic anywhere, no streetlights; god as my wittness;  this thing came over us from behind, all at once.  dark in the center, red, blue, green round lights oscillating around the perimiter of the round shape. it was over us, like as high as the old phone and power lines were back then-15-20 ft.  we were surprised but not terrified and my 1st thought was some weird helicopter, then knew it couldn't be because there was no noise or wind from it.  total silence and it hovered right over us as we cantered the 1.5 city block,back home.  we ran into the front door of the house, telling my mom about it as we ran to the back screen door to watch as it had passed over my house, quietly gliding across the empty fields, s.E. towards, and over our old church and various houses.  it didn't harm us.  my mom and older sister probably didn't believe us, but do now.   i wasn't negatively affected by this and thought it was interesting and exciting but;  later when we went to bed, we weren't even talking about it when i turned off the light to go to sleep, my friend freaked out-panicked and said she saw huge black eyes all around.  she called her mom to come get her(my friend lived a couple of miles up the hill towards the dam).  i experienced none of the frightening visions that she did.  i just thought she was over sensitive and imagined that part.  strangely, it was not spoken of by any of us again, yet we remained good friends. i later moved out of state.  would love to know what she remembers about that incident.  it would be interesting to be regressed in case there are more details.  i definitely would take a lie detector test, because this did happen.\r\n  in the alamosa colorado hills, late 1960s, my dad and older siblings had also seen dead, wild horses with green, glowing goo coming out of them, as well as strange lights in the sky, moving in ways that no air plane or jet could have. none of us reported any of this, for the same reasons others don't.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

photos of the drone in flight. this was in a large open space area approx. 1/2 mile from my house. while taking the video/photos i noticed nothing else in the sky at all. no planes, nothing. of course my eyes were on the sky the entire time. later when i loaded the photos into my computer i noticed an odd shaped \"sky snake\" hovering above my drone. i cannot tell how far away it is with the 2 dimensional photo. again, i did not see it when i took the photo. i didn't see anything in the sky after taking the photos either. it's impossible to give any more detail since i didn't find the object until after i downloaded the photos. i posted on fb, no one has any idea what this thing might be. how about you guys after seeing the photo attached? any educated guesses?","distance":"101-500

reason caught my attention. i kept staring at it and noticed it was hovering up and down but not drasticly or landing, maybe a thousand feet off the ground and a mile away. it was late and i was tired so i kept rubbing my eyes to make sure my contacts weren't just making a stars light look blurry. then its orb light would dissapear an green/orange lights around the edges would light up. i thought it looked like a saucer with the lights arranged around it. when it switched to the color lights a white light/beam appeared underneath shining straight down. it seemed to move around up and down and wasn't moving very far away. it kept the same patter for 10mins. orb light-green/orange lights- white light shining down. at one point the orb began to dim and go into clouds. i thought it was gone but within a few seconds all the clouds around it lit up into a bright light and it started moving toward me. i couldn't tell how fast or what its specific course was but seconds after seeing it light up the cloud, the craft was  500 yards away and maybe 300 feet off the ground moving toward me. i had called my mother right after it began. i told her i think its coming toward me an maybe 15sec later it had closed the distance and was continueing to move south in my direction. i couldn't see lights off of it anymore, i believe i was now seeing underneath it the craft. the looked triangle shaped, black with the point of the triangle squared off. it had closed that distance so fast and was so close to the ground i took off running back to my house and stayed inside. i've never seen one before, never seen big foot, or a ghost but this was extremely scary and undoubtedly an alien craft. seriously if that ever happens again i'm moving to the city.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the east to west commercial flightpath, i saw and imaged what initially looked like landing lights moving west at 8:43. \r\n\r\nsomething not understood took place, whereby the lights became much brighter and painted with two lines of variable thickness in apparent erratic movements like, but not camera shake. the image so painted in the viewfinder was quite bright.  i continued to click the nikon @200mm until it (they) disappeared.\r\n\r\nso, i have before, during and after shots of the event on june 1, 2015.\r\n\r\nplease find with magnifying glass about 7 orbs associated with the bright form; and that they are round and of several colors, and not duplicated in pairs as the lines were.  after examining the image in camera and at a monitor resolution of 2564 x 1440 resolution, i realized something extraordinary had happened.  the orbs also left a trail, some brownish, and some green.\r\n\r\nall images were taken at 8:43.  there was no air traffic on the flightpath, nor was there any coming from the airforce base during the shooting time.\r\n\r\nmy feelings? exited, like they had been on every sighting. that is, six from the backyard, beginning in november 2014 and at least one object at our amateur rocket launching site this year, after sending missiles to at least 2000ft.\r\n\r\nmufon can expect more reports. i would be glad to provide larger files on request.
