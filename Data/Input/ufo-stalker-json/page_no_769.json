add this even. \r\n\r\nin 1984 i was an appretice baker working at the milton ulladulla bakery. the rear of the bakery had a verandah where we also cooled off our large racks of bread. i had a habit of standing on the balcony and looking at the sky to guage the weather as i often went shooting on my way home if i got away whilst it was dark. \r\nthe bakery is elevated and you can see the coast and inlet in the distance. i noticed a really bright light and thought it was just headlights. as my night vision cleared (it was darker outside) i noticed that the light was actually above the headland. i thought it must have been a new street lamp of unusual brightness. but then a second light appeared perhaps 100 meters from it and same elevation and that one was clearly out last land over the ocean. more and more appeared, some faded. the brightness intensity was incredible. the colours were different too. some looked just white while others had a red glow to them. \r\n\r\nat the time i thought i was watchign ball lightening as i had read a lot about that phenomena but whilst there was cloud in the sky it was not stormy and there was no electrical feel. the lights did not move or travel they simply appeared brightened and eventually blinked out. the most i say at once was about 6. i wanted to watch more but my boss came out looking for me and told me to get my arse back inside. i tried to show him but he was not interested. typical greek !\r\n\r\nover the years i have learned a lot about ufo and ball lightening. i am an amature astronomer so i know what the planets look like especially venus. i am aware of temperature inversions and light reflections and what i saw in my teens was none of that.  i had also seen what appeared to be a slow moving comet crash into the ocean in the same region too but it happened so fast i had not time to alert anyone else to it. from what i know of meteors or comets they would move faster, be brighter and would not leave a white streak all the way to the water. or not. \r\n\r\nthe water off the coast there is in a wide bay with inlets. from my scuba diving experience the water can be quite deep, too deep to dive. the location is quite isolated and in the country most people go to bed at 9pm so watchign this at almost 2am it is easy to believe that if these objects ere not natural phenomena they would not expect to be observed. \r\n\r\ni have not seen anything remotely interesting since that time.  i do look and i of course carry a camera with me when i am out but i do not hide my breath becaue my phone camera struggles to take a picture of the moon let alone anything else.  \r\n\r\ni am well educated and i do believe there is something going on. there are too many witnesses. i would love to help interview people as i have a background in nlp, counselling and even have a hypnotherapy business so i can use hypnotherapy to help witnesses remember without planting suggestions and creating halucinations. \r\n\r\nif you need someone with my skills let me know.  i would like to push for more openness about ufo's especially in light of historical debunking like project blue book etc.\r\n\r\nbrett

the light. i was passing the conway hospital on my left and i could see this strange bright golden star.It just looked like a gold light in the sky. it is not super big, but it somehow caught my attention. i was mainly curious about what it was. i figured it was just a plane or something at first, put it did not move in the sky really as i was driving down the road. so i just kept watching it to figure it out because it was getting noticeably larger after a minute or so of driving. i became curious because i could not figure out what it was. i took the exit for 501 business and was approaching the wooded forest right beside the conway bridge and i could tell that i was close to the light. i cruised along slowly trying to see the light through the treeline. about 3/4 of the way down the wooded road before the bridge i come up even with the light and for a couple seconds i could see the source. i saw this triangular metal object in the sky.The object was darker grey in color from what i could tell, and there may have been a little texture on the bottom of the object as well (i mainly mean that the bottom did not look completely smooth). it was unmoving to me the whole time i saw the object, but i was too far away to perceive smaller movements for most of the event. i saw placed around this object's edge three colors of lights. yellow, white, and red. they were not blinking. at first i thought it was a radio or cell tower, but then i saw no supporting structures near the object and did not know what was going on. i lost sight after a couple of seconds. i was freaking out a little bit, but i wanted to be very sure i was not just seeing something like a tower. so i turned right down state rd s 26-14 to see what was going on. i lost sight of the object after passing it, and then a few seconds later i made the turn. i drove slowly looking for any sign of any lights or man made structures. i drive down the whole road and i saw no lights. i figured it could be just the road i was on that kept me from seeing any lights even though i should have a better view of them. i proceed to drive back towards myrtle beach on 501 for a little bit so that i can come back the same way i can and see the light from where i already saw it. whenever i turned around (just before the olivers on 501 business) i could not see the light that i had seen before. at this point i am freaking out a little. while im driving back towards the bridge i keep scanning the sky for any sign of what i had witnessed earlier. i saw nothing, i drove over into downtown conway and i turned around so i could be on top of the bridge and look back towards the treeline where i was originally seeing the object. there was still nothing that i saw, so i drove for a bit, turned around, and went home. it was a clear night sky, it was around mid 70's fahrenheit. not very much wind.

stars. \r\n\r\ni immediately noticed two bright stars about four fingers apart (arm outstretched) to the south, just to the right of antares, and slightly above. i was disturbed, because i am a frequent star-watcher, and there are no such bright stars in that location at this time of year. i was immediately drawn to them.\r\n\r\ni watched them, slightly perplexed, for about a minute and a half, all the while thinking \"those shouldn't be there\". they were stationary.\r\n\r\nafter about a minute they began to move northwards (towards me) and within seconds they began to fade, and then winked out with small flickers. the time from when they began to fade to when they disappeared was approximately 3 seconds. they were slightly brighter just before they faded, almost as though they winked back to full brightness before they disappeared, just for a split second. they were moving for about 2 seconds before they started to fade.\r\n \r\ni sat there absolutely baffled, and then ran

this went on for over 15 minutes and eventually they both went west until out of sight. i did not record this with my phone but in the 15 minutes this was happening, i observed at least 20 other

staring for about a minute because it puzzled me. i finally asked my father to look at them. he noticed them to. one of the stars started making a circular motion around the other star. obviously, it was not a star. we were dumbfounded. halfway around, it pulled away and moved southeast it was moving very fast. it continued looking like a star.Unfortunately, a building was in the way and we lost sight of it. we both agreed that it was not of this earth. a week later,i happened to see a short article in a large montreal newspaper. the president of an aerospace company was having a vacation with his family in england. they were walking along the cliffs of dover at night.He happened to see two stars unusually close together. one started making the same motion as i have described. he kept looking and  an astonishing thing happened. it abruptly moved at what appeared to be a ninety degree angle to its trajectory and then moved forward. a bit later it repeated the exercise,all this at a high speed.He stated that after what he saw he had no doubt that there is intelligent life in the universe. it is possible we saw the same thing thousands of miles apart. he was fortunate that his view was not obstructed.Unfortunately, i never contacted him.Stupid on my part.Decades later, it remains solidly in my mind and for an unknown reason the sight has always troubled me.

in the middle of the road. it was extremely bright. it was only one light. it looked like it was smack in the middle of the road up ahead. my first thought was that it was a vehicle that only had one headlight working, and obviously must have had its brights on. i would say it appeared to be about 150 to 200 feet ahead of us. i slowed down my speed because it was blinding me. i assumed that we would be passing each other soon on the road. i eventually pulled over to the side of the road to let this thing pass me. because not only was i blinded, but also it looked as though, again, it was partly in my lane. however, we never did; it never passed me. i then thought it was a broken down vehicle, and further away then i first estimated, because i kept thinking, surely i should have passed it already or it should have passed me. i started to drive again when i realized this thing was not going to be passing me. i started to drive. again, it looked as though it was a big semi about to plow us over, so i pulled over a second time to let it by. this time i tried to awaken my older son in the front seat. i wanted him to see this light and help me figure out what it was, or just simply tell me what he saw. i was very tired and had been driving for many hours and thought maybe i was not seeing straight. i couldn't come up with any other explanation, for all other rational explanations were quickly being depleted. i could not awaken my older son, so i began to shake my younger child in the back. he too would not awaken. at this time i started to freak out slightly and get a little scared. the light is not making sense to me, and my children surely would have awoken to my shaking and my voice that had to of sounded a little worried and unusual to them. i then had a thought that i'm out here in the middle of nowhere, with my kids in a car, stopped on the side of the road. i thought that this could be a set-up, a trick, and someone could be approaching us right now while i'm just sitting here. so, despite my almost inability to drive and see the road because of the blinding, i again pulled onto the road and started driving out of fear of being stationary. again, we never passed \"the car\", \"the semi\", \"the train coming down the middle of the road\", or whatever it was. we never got closer to it, never passed it, and it never pulled away or off the road. it seemed to always be the same distance from us, and right smack in front of us, regardless of how much distance i drove, or regardless of any turns or bends in the road. and then, just as it was \"just there\" and i don't recall it appearing or how it appeared or when it appeared, now it was just gone. and now i was driving ahead as though nothing was ever there.","distance":"101-500

like it, so i took out my phone and started recording. the recording is 6 mins 47 seconds of me just scanning the sky for more weird clouds. a huge chemtrail made its appearance too. it wasnt until i played it back that i discovered a bright ball of something glide its way down to a dimmer light below it. as the bright ball was moving a glowing tail trailed out of the back of it. the video is choppy because like i said, i didnt even realize that was there at that point.  but i took some stills and enlarged them. i dont know if my eyes are playing tricks on me but i think there are more

something cought my eye aproaching from my right to my left pov.\r\n\r\nit was very fast when compared to the size or a airplane, around 10x the size of a a320 following a domestic path, this when looking at the same supposed distance/height, a height where you can clearly distinguish the winglets/ tail lights. compared to a star which is only a small dot it would be roughly around 100x's the size, alot brighter!\r\n\r\nregarding the brightness: this object was very bright, enough to made me turn my head and aknowledge it's presence. it made a small straight path horizontally, this while getting brighter. just imagine 1 (one) true white led of a flashlight, now put it in a dark room, make a small path with your hand holding the flashlight and you have a rough idea.\r\n\r\nthen, the most impressive thing about this sight, it pulsated for about 1 second, and it switched direction  in a rigid \"v\" shaped maneuver and it left a trail in the sky for about 1 second that quick disapeared while bliking the eye. the pulse was obvious, as also was the trail. it was basically like the entreprise warming up and going to warp speed in the well known movie. but alot more distance in this one.\r\n\r\nno idea of the origin, who made etc. just clearly something not natural, like the shooting star that preceeded it around 4m. the type of light, movement nature (something not being propeled with fuel combustion engines, much more smoother), the relative velocity of the path in the sky and way it went to \"warp\" in a v shapped 180º change of direction.... just unbelieveble.\r\n\r\nalso, is anyone is closer to this it would be blind looking at it. this was  pure 7000k white, very homogeneous/soft but also solid light there!","distance":"Over One
