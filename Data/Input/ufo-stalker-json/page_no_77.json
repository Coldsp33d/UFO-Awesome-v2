(+/-2 minutes) as i saw a flying object. the object was oval like an egg, but a bit more rounded on his lateral extremes. it had two windows, from which lights were seen. the windows were located at the front, under the middle radius of the object. the form of them were very characteristically, at the sides of the windows towards the middle the 2 sides were angled, and the side towards the outline was one round. it was dark by that time. i noticed the object, because i was in the right field of view, when it flied from north to south at the horizon in a straight line. it was at least four times faster than a domestic airplane. i was shocked when i saw it, because i interpreted it at the first glance like a ufo, because it is well-known that no airplane can flight at such an accelerated speed. i stopped running when i saw it. the crucial point of my observation, what made me sure to have seen a ufo, is the following: after 1 and a half second it vanished, while it flew. i believe the object accelerated that much that it was impossible to follow it with eyes, because his direction was vienna. i stared at the point i saw it for 2 minutes, because i was so impressed of my experience. i was astonished, because i had a personal proof that ufos are a real phenomenon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

already down but it was not completely dark yet. i was riding along a country lane at a speed of 20 km a hour to the east. i do't know what made me notice it, suddenly it was there at my right side. it was a glowing electric blue orb, it admitted no sound and it went overhead with a enormous speed and it dissapeard behind a tree. it must have came from behind me from a great altitude (there were clouds in the sky and there was some normal air traffic in the form of passenger planes) and it desended very fast to earth in a straight line until it dissapeard behind the tree. i never have seen anything go so fast except meteors. at first, i thought it was a meteor becouse i've seen a blue meteor crashing in a field a couple of years before, but i realized it didnot had a tale of light. the tree were the orb had dissapeared behind was about 20 meters in front of me. i went as fast as i could to see if i could find it behind there, but nothing was to be seen. at this point i hoped to see it again, and it left me a bit puzzled about what it was. i decided it was not a normal sighting of a meteor(no tail) or a human aircraft (to slow). and somthing about that intense blue light made me think it could have been a ufo.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

couldn't help but notice, something glowing extremely bright, high in the night sky, far above lit homes, as seen from my backyard. i wanted to think it might be a brightly lit plane or hovering helicopter, as it seemed to be hovering, then moving forward. however, it always remained glowing. when i opened the backyard glass door, it was impossible to to look up, whatever the object was, it was way to bright to be any aircraft, i've ever seen. it moved in my direction but never past my house, i called my wife to have a look, she commented,'' your friends are back,'' (jokingly) as these sightings, are concurrent. \r\n\r\ni couldn't look out the backyard door, and not be forced to look up, it was a beautiful glowing object, when i first saw it, it was hovering, then flowed forward, effortlessly, almost like it shouldn't have moved so gracefully. i wanted to know more about it and watch it but i was in a tee-shirt & it was almost freezing outside. i honestly didn't want to take my eyes off of it but my wife was hurrying me as we were going to do some late night grocery shopping. \r\n\r\ni only had my cell phone on me this time so that is what i used to take a digital photo

wasn't really a ufo but it was weird. in 2014, i was 16 at the time, average night. i went to bed early with my dog because i had a test the next morning. i woke up suddenly around 1-something in the morning no idea what woke me up. then i started to have a piercing headache i sat up and rubbed my eyes and looked around and i noticed a small trail of what i can only describe as a small wisp of fog and or mist or smoke, flying around my room at a fast, steady speed. i thought it was my imagination because it was so tiny but when it flew right by my face, it looked so real i grabbed my phone and quickly started taking flash pictures all around my room trying to catch it in one, all the while just thinking \"i've gotta get this, i've gotta get this\", and my head hurt more and more.\r\n\r\n then i don't really remember what happened next i must have fallen asleep or something because i woke up from a nightmare the next morning (don't remember what it was about now). i was in an awkward position on my bed and my phone was on the floor face down a few feet from my bed (thankfully not broken). remembering last night, i quickly jumped up, picked it up and looked through the pictures i took carefully scanning each one slowly... and then i saw it. i actually caught the thing in a picture (even though it was a bad phone camera at the time and a little blurred). top of the picture is the small wisp of smoke flying beside my curtain, it zipped around so fast i'm actually surprised i got it. you can also see my dog sleeping soundly in the bottom of the photo. since that night i've seen lots of weird things and i found out a few weeks after i don't dream anymore, all i get is the occasional nightmares or i'm just in a dead sleep... i told my parents about what happened the day it happened and they had no idea. i sent my dad a copy of the photo because said he wanted to show it to some people. recently he brought it up again and so i thought i would put this up somewhere. i was curious whether this has happened to anyone else. or if anyone and seen it in another way, or could debunk it for me.\r\n\r\n20 yr.Old me tried to recreate the picture with dust and lights trying to debunk it but i never could figure it out. my window was closed but left unlocked on the second floor. it flew around my room unnaturally fast and i've never seen it again since. but over the next years since then i've seen this ufo in the sky. normally it is the same object and i see it over my house or at my family's cottage in the sky. \r\n\r\n a black triangle with a white light on each point, flying super fast past (faster then any plane i've seen and i've been to air shows before) or just hovering and disappearing into clouds or all together in a starry night, making me wonder if i even saw it. never got any picture or proof of them though... i either didn't have a phone while on my walk or hike, or i wasn't fast enough. i recently saw one again in november over my house but again i wasn't fast enough to get a picture. i'm a very proof driven person so normally i say 'get a picture or evidence or it's like it didn't happen.' no picture = no proof, and it could just be your mind playing tricks on you..\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

about 1986 in late fall or winter, i woke up one night because the blankets over my feet were vibrating. earthquakes are fairly common in the area and i thought that was probably the cause but outside was an intensely bright light like a welding arc that cast sharp shadows on the walls and the trees outdoors but it was silent and steady. there was a gravel road beside the house lined w/ some bushes that cast the shadows. the gravel betrayed anyone that walked on it, even deer, but especially a car which might have had its headlights on. the light was too intense for headlights and there was no sound, so i got up and started to go down to see what it was, thinking that it looked like some kind of ufo. as i made it to the stairs, i visualized some course of events; i could check it out and go back to bed w/ my girlfriend and baby daughter, or i could check it out and disappear forever. not a hard choice, but i then felt fearful, the decision seemed to affect it, and the light went out. the next day i checked out the spot on the driveway where it had been, there was no sign that i could see. a few days later my neighbor (betty deutche sp?) said that on that night her back door was rattling (vibrating like the blankets on my bed) like someone was trying to get in. a month or two later i heard that traffic had been roadblocked for awhile on comptche rd around that time(?) by military people w/ green uniforms and rifles, and that a saucer had been seen traveling up one of the higher ridges between orr springs and ukiah. sorry i don't know the person who told me & didn't put the 2 events together till later. mufon might have a record of it though since the craft and the roadblock was seen by several people.","distance":"21-100

never reported on it, i also called the mclennan county sherrifs department and they chuckled and never got any further than that, then it happened again, on december 13, at 8:08pm, same stretch of
