clouds.  for a couple of weeks now, the clouds have been looking really strange.  they are very feathery, which is not really unusual, but the cloud cover typically forms these patterns after i see planes/chemtrails (still don't know if i buy into this theory, but after this sighting, i'm not sure).\r\n\r\nlike i said, the clouds were really feathery, except some in the distance, and one in particular.  it had a grey tone to it and was round, like one would expect a small storm cloud to look, except it was too small to be that.  something told me to take a picture of it.  i positioned my iphone 6 in that direction and watched my viewfinder as the camera focused and snapped.  when the photo snapped, i noticed, what looked like a pixel on my screen, flash.  immediately i reviewed the picture, not believing what i had just saw, and, sure enough, there was a craft.  i watched for another 5 minutes, taking pictures of this cloud moving closer to my position.  it scared me.  i felt like it knew i saw it and was coming to check me out.\r\n\r\ni went into the house to use the restroom and make another cup of coffee.  approximately 4 minutes passed and i returned to the front porch.  the cloud was gone, completely.  what remained were the large, whispy, feathery clouds that never moved.  in midland, friday evening, we were under a wind advisory.  the wind was blowing 20+ mph, i believe i read, but the only cloud that moved was this one.\r\n\r\nadditionally, over the remainder of what looked like the city of midland, was another feathery cloud, except when i looked up at it, it seemed to be fake.  it was very thick and had a yellow haze to it.  it also seemed relatively low to the ground, like i could climb a tall building and touch it.  the photos i took didn't show the hazy effect, but you can see the \"structure\" (lines that look like vertebrae & ribs) these feathery clouds form.  i'm seeing them (clouds) all of the time over the last couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nexact positions and distance from me are unknown.  i'm no good determining distance like that.  plus, it's west texas, so there aren't really any good reference points because of the desert environment.\r\n\r\ni have other pictures of the cloud moving as well as a video, but none of them show any other objects, that i can see.

to look and then i saw a very bright object above the 2nd eagle, it was round in appearance. flying from directly over my head at a very high altitude heading south. me and my grandson both watched it for about a minute before it disappeared in the distant. 20 minutes later the object came back heading north in the same path it had come . this time it was a lot lower in altitude i estimate about 2000 or 3000 ft above the ground. it traveled north and stopped and hovered, south of me. from my angle it appeared to be at about a 40 degree angle. the object stopped and hovered for about 1 minute and a second object appeared coming from the south. it headed north and stopped next to the first object side by side. they were hovering for about a minute when the one on the left started to travel southeast. the other headed south. during this time i took several pictures with my phone and camera. when both objects had left about 10 minutes later i saw a 3rd object this one a lot lower in altitude heading south a very fast pace. i observed the third object with binoculars and it appeared to be silver in color reflecting the evening sun. it travelled at fast rate and was out of sight in

looking up always only seen all kinds of planes which to me have always looked crazy like omg planes flyng in the air its crazy to me ... not last night !!! i looked to my left and suddenly this huge bright white light appeared!!! about 7-10 times bigger than how big the air planes look like from my view and it had grown from this little light to huge in less than a second!!! then it started traveling to the left so fast it went from huge circle to a \"line\" shape of bright light and dissapeared !!! this was a few seconds no more than 5 seconds duration i stayed there 2 more hours until 2 am and nothing came back or appeared i had a ufo dream for the first time in my life 3 weeks ago and it was pretty real and intense all the ufo's coming at the same time and i'm just so freakin' happy that what i saw had nothing to do with me i have no idea what i would do if i saw an air craft just hovering over me or saw an alien i have always believed and felt something even without seeing shows reading books knowing nothing i just always knew they existed but im thankful that's all i have to report i have a 1 year old and a 4 year old and i just want us safe and if someone were to appear again and show him/herself to me i freakin hope its benevolent and help change our lives for the good but i live in a city where it's not a hot spot so it makes me wonder alot ... i did hear about the 1970's when a helicpopter reported the light following them up in the air in glendale and they called the bob hope airport and there was nothing on the radar ... well this is the same kind
