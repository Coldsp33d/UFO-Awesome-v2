about 1:30am in 2014.  i couldn't sleep, so i went to the back yard to smoke a cigarette.  i sat down on our rode iron chairs with over stuffed pillows, relaxed, put my head back and was looking at sky at a north east direction.  looking at all the stars was beautiful, suddenly one star just a little touch to the right got very bright.  i turned my head just one click to the right and starred at the star.  then to my shock that star drew one line in the sky about one inch wide.  it was like a huge florescent light in the sky.  then that brightness shot up and made a rectangle standing up, except that it had a triangular streak, wide at the bottom and going across the center of the rectangle, in the middle.  the rectangle has so bright it lit up the entire neighborhood, as if it were day time.  i did not take my eyes off of it for one second.  i starred inside and noticed it was circular and smooth inside.  as if i were looking into a cigar shaped object. inside was the whitest white you can ever imagine.  inside the rectangular circular thing was what i can only call a space ship.  it was dull silver, really banged up.  it was sectioned.  like one cone on top of another cone. so, i saw the first three sections  of the ship.  it was huge!  as big as los angeles, itself! this was a mother ship cloaked from human eyes.  i looked deep inside the object and say the first 3 sections of the space craft. it was obviously floating in the center of the cigar shaped cloaked object.  this all lasted about 7 seconds, but they were the longest 7 seconds of my life. then it zipped down, accross to the original starting point and dimmed like all other stars.  that star still remains and i feel it is a port hole for them to look at us and observe.\r\n\r\n  then about 10 days later, i went to the backyard at around 6:30pm.  the sun was setting and i was sitting in the same chair.  relaxed looking up at the sky, then i noticed something bright in the sky about 3 clicks to the right or east. this bright light started to go around and around until it was one firey  circle. as if it were cutting thru some stuffing.  then suddenly that same real bright flourescent light appeared or shot out from the middle of the firey circle. i then saw what looked like a flea fly out from the middle. the light turned off and the firey circle started slowing down until it came to a stop and dissapeared. \r\n\r\n  about 6 months ago i saw what looked like a bright light streak above my house, i was in the back yard. it went higher and higher, until it left our atmosphere with a firey blast.  i heard the same click when it left our atmosphere, again as if turning off an oxygen based propulsion and changing into some outer space kind of propulsion (sounds like ion based propulsion).  the trouble is that it veered to the right above our atmosphere catching the sun's rays high above our night sky. i saw that it was a triangular craft with one large engine in the back. i did hear and felt a click when it left our atmosphere, as if shutting down an oxygen based propulsion and turning on a space based propulsion system. \r\n\r\n  my last encounter was just days ago, when i saw the same kind of object leaving our atmosphere, except that this time the exhaust aimed directly at me as i felt the propulosion and warmth of the force. i still see reflective objects in my eyes, as if someone took a flash picture at you and you see stuff for days.  there is a strange sensation in the back of my brain ever since.\r\n\r\n  finally, about 3 days after christmas in 2013 i saw a super nova in orians belt. in between the two left stars.  i felt a huge waive of sadness. it was overwhelming.  as if a whole civilization was destroyed and what was left weaped in sorrow.  i believe these people have known a close star was going super nova close to their home world soon. they have been preparing for this inevitable moments for over 3,000 years.  this is why they have been visiting us and why they are here now. how i know this?  i don't know but it does all add up.","distance":"Over One

elementary school awaiting dismissal at 3:15 p.M. my vehicle was facing east and all windows were down. a minor motor vehicle accident had occurred within the lot about ten minutes earlier and had the attention of most people present. i looked up out of my driver's window at the dark, blackened thunderclouds which were moving in from the west. i observed a shiny, chrome oval/bean shape ascending slowly in a northerly direction. i believed the object to be a mylar balloon. it was several hundred feet away.  the object then pulsated a bright red light for about about 2 seconds. it wasn't really a flash. i thought that the sun must be reflecting off of a picture on this balloon. but then it pulsed red again as it continued ascending. it was almost as if it was blinking on and off like aircraft beacon lights. the pulses became more rapid as it went higher towards the cloud. at this point i thought that perhaps it was a large drone with lights and not a balloon. i realized that the object was too large to be a mylar balloon for me to be able to still see it well at the distance it now was(over 500 feet away). but the oval/bean shape was wrong for a drone. as this object was approaching the black cloud i then observed a similar bright, pulsing red light come from within the cloud. this light was more muted as it was within the cloud. i saw no second object, just that light. the first object then pulsed red one more time and ascended into the cloud. i did not see any objects or lights after that. i don't know what i saw in this fleeting moment. i did not take any photo or video. i did not report this to any local authorities. my three year old daughter was with me in vehicle. the object was definitely unusual, but what puzzles me is the light in the cloud.

the  half moon, about three to five miles away at cloud level, was a flat, grey, rectangular object hovering gracefully in the sky.\r\n\r\ni stared at it for a few more moments before turning the led

wasn't a glint of light.\r\n\r\nalso, the edges of the object were sharp and straight, and the rectangle was hovering evenly as if it were a levitating book. i immediately contacted some of my

still a bright evening with no clouds in the sky. \r\n\r\ni usually have my head in the sky these days due to a similar sighting a few weeks ago at home. i was driving on a section of the road that was pretty straight, and in my eyeline i saw what looked like a bright star just straight ahead but seemed to be high in the sky. i usually would have passed it off as a bright star but it was way too sunny still for there to be stars even of that calibre. as i kept on driving i noticed it shimmy to my left a little bit, but i'm not sure if that was an illusion as i was still in motion at this point. some trees then blocked my few of it for about 10 seconds, and without turning a corner or anything (i knew where it would be in my eyeline) after the trees revealed the sky again, it had vanished, that was my jaw-drop moment. i then focused very hard to try and see anything around that portion of the sky that it might have been like a plane or copter, but there was nothing there, and the sun was behind me so i could easily see the portion of sky that it was occupying. \r\n\r\na similar thing happened a few weeks ago while at home in barnsley. it was a similar time in the evening, maybe dusk, a bright yellow light appeared in the sky moving slowly across to my right, i tracked it for about 2 minutes and saw it just fizzle out, this time i had noticed nearby where it faded that there was a large dark helicopter near it's path. i don't know if this had anything to do with it, but it was moving away from my position so it is unlikely it was a searchlight or anything [searchlights aren't usually that yellowy in colour, i should know as i work in lighting as part of my job].\r\n\r\ni have read stories about what happens when people start seeing these orbs in the sky and i'm not sure if i like where it is going, although i am still curious.\r\n\r\nwill report anything else i notice.\r\n\r\nkeep your eyes in the sky folks :)\r\n\r\nawt","distance":"Over One

light on the vast desert surface caught my attention through the window. \r\n\r\n2. the light came through my window and reflected into my eyes, getting my attention to turn to the window. \r\n\r\n3. at first i thought the light could be a huge flood light, like the kind they use in construction sites at night. \r\n\r\n4. it appeared to be a huge sphere of extremely bright glowing light, hovering over the desert surface, with what appeared to be a search light on the ground below. i stared at the object, trying to take in details and figure out what it was. it was very odd to me that this bright light was the only visible thing in the desert as far as my eyes could see. as the plane i was in traveled past the object, there was a short time i could not see it. but before the wing covered it, it appeared to be moving and becoming 3 separate lights, slightly smaller and less bright than the initial light. when the wing passed over the object and i could see it again, it was 3 lights which appeared to be in a straight line, i was unable to determine the distance between them. the search light on the ground was no longer visible at this point. the objects appeared to either be hovering over the ground, or on the ground at this point, and stationary. the shape and color of the lights remained spherical and white-yellow, however it went from 1 to 3, the 3 appeared smaller and less bright than the initial 1 light. \r\n\r\n5. initially i felt confused as to what this bright light in the middle of nowhere was, and why it was there. i could see no reason for it, nor anything but desert within eye sight from my pov in the plane. i looked around the plane to see if anyone else was observing it so i could ask them what they thought, but all passengers were asleep. there were two soldiers sitting near me, and i wanted to wake them so they could witness it too. after the confusion i felt curious, as i have had many other experiences for years, and wondered if this was another one or something explainable. once the plane passed out of site of the lights i simple remained curious, as the whole thing was an unusual scene. curious enough that i am reporting it to you the next day. i have no feelings about this specific event, but i do of course have feelings from other experiences i have had in the past. \r\n\r\n6. the plane i was flying in flew out of sight of the object(s)/light(s).

aircraft or maybe 3 moving in formation).We scrambled up onto his roof to watch them, get a video, or take a picture, but they had already vanished. whatever it was did not look like any known aircraft and either moved away from us very quickly or moved straight down in such a way that it would be impossible for any aircraft to replicate. it seemed to be at least twice as big as a
