in the sky...Which was a vivid white. first thought was it must be a plane, because i knew the coles county airport was ahead of me to the south west. the sun was in front  of me, and was peeking out of the clouds. the suns rays shined on the object, making it look illuminated, almost dream like. as i got closer, i realized i didn't know what i was seeing but that it definitely wasn't an airplane. in the middle was a solid white object. i'm not sure of the shape, but remember thinking that must be where the pilots are. it was encircled by white pipelike appendages. they went out above and below the object. it looked like a large geometric shape that you might find in a textbook. the appendages were connected to the solid shape. the shape stood still, as the appendages revolved up and over the solid object. they moved a slow 360 degree around the object . all around the object was a mist, or aura. in a way, it reminded me of the mirage that you see on a road in the summer. as the appendages turned, the object would disappear. then on their way back up, the sun would hit it and allow me to see another glimpse of it. again as the appendages turned, it disappeared again. this continued. the thought came to me that the aura was a cloaking device to make it invisible. however due to the dismal day, the sun peeking out of the clouds on the object, made it appear. it had something to do with the appendages turning. when they were coming back up, behind the object, it would reappear as the suns rays hit it. i called the airport the next day, and got an answering machine. so then i called the restaurant there, and asked if they had had any air shows there the afternoon before. she said no. i'm not sure what i saw...But it wasn't ours.","distance":"101-500

garage discussing business. i noticed a star off on the horizon, it was the same size or bigger than the star next to it, but the color was more reddish orange. as i stared at it i noticed it was moving. i followed it across the sky, gaining altitude from my perspective, as it got closer i was expecting to see the flashing lights of an aircraft, i continued watching looking for lights, at this point the light was nearing 90 degrees to the horizon and my brother in-law curious as to what i was looking at, looked up at the last second to see it flash and then disappear. he asked what it was and i had no answer. as i started to tell him where i had first noticed the light there was a second one in it's place. same size, same color, same flight path, same speed, as it got closer and higher in the sky you definitely could make out the color changing between a yellowish-orange to orange to reddish-orange to red, and back and forth and again. then at it's highest point above our heads it flashed, dimmed and gone. this time my brother in-law said, that's no plane. amazingly as i looked back at where these lights came from, a third!! as the third one worked it's way across the sky i panned the rest of the sky and pointed out 2 planes in the area, you could definitely make out the flashing white light on one of the planes and the flashing red and green lights of the other. looking back at the third light it was nearing the point were the other 2 had disappeared, again, it flashed, dimmed and disappeared. as we marveled at what they could have been i blurted out, there's f-ing four of them. same spot, same thing, same flight, same disappearing act. there was no fragmenting of these objects, like something burning up in the atmosphere. they stayed consistly the same, no changes, other than color, no flashes, no sparks, no flare ups, nothing normal. the lights came from an easterly direction, heading west, slowly. from a point about 10 degrees off horizon to 90

quite awesome and exciting, has left me unsettled. i did not plan to run an errand at 9 pm that night, but suddenly had a wild idea to go out for a late dessert, which i have never done before. i felt

areas, or the areas where i observed patterns of strange activity and possible close encounters.\r\nthis night, on my pass to the cemetery to deliver the funeral home their subscription, i noticed a dimly reflecting surface giving movement and light play back onto my peripheral vision. i heard a dull whirring noise, and some other metal clanging noises. i saw strange lights illuminating a tree in the cemetery on my way in. i thought i saw a object moving and hovering around the cemetery below the tree line and among the oak trees near the intersection. i heard static noises. i heard what sounded like whispering.\r\ni decided to turn back around from the next turn about and record starting out with a time and date check on my cell phone and a location check on my car's g.P.S. display, something i have become accustomed to doing.\r\ni went back the other direction to make a u-turn and stop in a turn lane and began making note of a strange light coming from inside the cemetery.\r\ni saw with my own eyes how it appeared to be a pale, bald man staring back at me from what looked like a modest sized porch or screened lanai with a light. i realized that there are no homes and this was closer than the opposite edge of the cemetery, and in that direction, there are only the rear and sides of adjacent businesses. i zoomed in to record what appeared to be an extraterrestrial. i noticed in the video when played back with enhanced audio gain, the presence of evp's ranging from soft whispers to loud vocalizations which are differentiated from my own speaking voice.\r\ni noticed that the light which was to the side of the being was casting a white light tinted blue-violet purple, and then the light changed suddenly to white light tinted yellow-green.\r\ni noted that the being seemed to be inside of a windowed room aboard a nearly silent object hovering just feet from the ground in the central darkened memorial park area of the cemetery.\r\nwhen i noticed that the light stopped shining from that position to become dark in that location, i began to drive away, followed by what seemed to be a whispering noise, and when reviewing i noticed that there were clicking or clanging noises on the audio briefly which i did not hear while recording. this lasted from approx. 2:16am to approx. 2:20am.\r\nnote:\r\nlater on i overheard strange almost bird call noises and questioned whether it was a bird since a video from the other day revealed loud bird calling when i do not in the slightest recall bird singing just before a video sighting of multiple objects concurrently.\r\nalso want to make note that later after that, something had snuck up on my car and made a noise like slapping the palm of your hand on the trunk completely without rhythm, which was startling and unexpected and i could not explain it by any conventional reasoning.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

between five and ten (i am forty-three now) when my mother and i were going through the mcdonald's drive thru in perry, georgia when i first noticed the object as it came into our line of sight because when turned the corner going around the restaurant. as we sat waiting in line facing south (towards cordele, ga) there was a bright white light that was giving off white rings (like smoke rings) coming toward us, through us, and past us. the object stayed in one spot, it did not rise, lower, or go from left to right. i would guess that the object was over a mile away. what i thought when i saw the object was that it was pretty cool (i must have been around seven or eight because i knew it was some sort of ufo and probably had already seen start wars and close encounters). if memory serves, we lost sight of the object because we left the area. afterwards i remember thinking that i had saw something extraordinary. i also remember the next day my mother telling me that it was reported as a weather balloon.\r\n\r\ni apologize that my description is not exactly what you asked for as i was a child and the only part i really remember is where i was, who i was with (which my mother has passed now, but we did talk about the incident when i was older), and what i saw. i have searched the internet trying to find anything that would explain what i saw, but have come up with nothing. as i am now much older, i know that a weather balloon is a ridiculous answer to what i saw. and i have thought about warner robins air force base being so close, that maybe it was some type of experiment, however, the base is in the opposite direction of the the object i saw.\r\n\r\nagain, if there is any other object like this that has been reported, or if anyone else reported the

feet above ground level at roughly 30 to 40 miles per hour due west 50 feet south of the eastbound 1604 feeder road. the spacecraft had three solid colored lights of different colors at what appeared to be front, center, and rear. the craft was so low it scared [item moved/cms/nd] me, and being an aviation expert, my immediate gut feeling was that there were actual aliens looming right over my convertible in the opposite direction. at the time of sighting, i was moving 30 mph at 9:35 pm burning off time, and in addition to low vehicle noise, there almost seemed to be a momentary reduction or even absence of noise. stunned, i turn into a parking lot neighboring paisano's, however the foliage renders the craft unavailable for a photo shoot. after holding in place for 10 minutes, i hop back into the convertible and race to make a u-turn at bitters to head west in the direction of the slow, low moving craft. i take the ramp for i-10 north and immediately to my right is what appears to be the same craft with a complex disk array of lights forming a sort of saucer shape banking unnaturally between top golf and marriot at an altitude of 300 feet agl. at the same time, i'm furiously pointing at the obviously lighted craft like a retard driving 30 on the highway, and yet no one cares to acknowledge the idea that aliens are without hundreds of feet proximity. this was indeed a challenging chase for me, from poor road access and the fact that iphone cameras suck unless it's a still in the daytime. i stay on active report for the next hour with only the sight of commercial aircraft on the 12r flight path into san antonio int'l. upon the second visual interception the craft accelerated rather quickly out of the area, evading sight possibly on intent. with two strange sightings before, i am now convinced and awestruck that at least one countable alien lifeform is camping out on this planet. the object appears extremely similar to the may 31st, 2015 weather bug
