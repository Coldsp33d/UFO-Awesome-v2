30 feet in center of road keeping traffic moving. the vehicle in front of us took a picture. one of the security folks stopped the vehicle and took the camera and removed the film. i then noticed a second disk on the embankment crossed the road (east) 30 yards. to the right of us was a field with some cattle fenced in. about three acres. on the east end of the property was a drive way (about a 100 yards) that gave access to the home. mid way was a third disk blocking access to the home. along this stretch of about a quarter mile were flat bed military trucks, duce & a half's, jeeps, & patrol cars. the disks all had the same characteristics. dark gunmetal gray. approximately 15 feet in diameter with a flat leading edge of 4 to 5 inch's. from the leading edge they tapered equally

had just left a convenience store. did not notice the object when i arrived. i got back into my jeep, lit a cigarette and as i was starting my engine i noticed a large, bright, pulsating, red/orange fireball-like light very low in the sky in the near distance. it appeared to be just on the edge of the town limits above the treeline. it appeared to be stationary. i watched it to see if it was moving but it was not. i had no idea what the object was. i was thinking chinese lantern at first, but it did not appear to be floating in any direction. i could not take my eyes off of it as i was completely perplexed as to what it could be. after a moment in decended below the treeline, that is when i thought perhaps someone strangely was flying a drone. i could not see if it landed at all. i was about to pull away thinking it was someone playing a prank with a drone. (we are a pretty small town and i have never witnessed a drone in our area) all of a sudden it ascended above the treeline again but was more to the right of its oringinal sighting, then it just stopped. my curiosity could ot take it anymore, so i decided to pursue it. i drove to where it appeared to be hovering. stopped my vehicle, got partway out and looked up at it above me. it began to ascend higher and move southwesterly. i still could not make out any distinct shape. it did not have any sound coming from it. i was pointing and yelling \"look\", trying to get passing traffic (2 cars) to notice it. it appeared to moved smoothly and on a straight path, as it was climbing higher into the night sky. almost like it knew i was pursuing it. i followed it for about 1/2 a km out of town and lost it in low lying clouds. i drove up the road a bit further to see if i could see it come out again. i parked, got out, and scanned the sky. i gave up after about 5 minutes and drove back to town to tell my friends who had been waiting for me to arrive. i was obviously freaked out and over excitied when i relayed my experience to them. i have been thinking about it for days now, so i decided to report my experience to see if it helps me calm down.

we went downtown vancouver to sight see and was crossing a bridge headed into town on a walk. we stopped on the bridge for a moment to rest and that is when i saw a pulsating object in the sky that was very shiny by eye observation. it was such a clear sky that the flashing is what caught my eye. i am a professional musician, kung fu martial artist, an artist who used to be a structural engineering designer before the economy crash. i was in the navy in the early 90's as a professional trained observer. i was a signalman in the navy. so, i was trained to notice minor details of distant objects. so, at first i knew it was not natural or a familiar aircraft. it was locked completely stationary, totally no travel in elevation nor distance. it rotated on it's own axis and pulsated either shiny glow like a light camera flashes about 3 to 4 per second. unwittingly, i was unaware at the time that the object looked totally different on the camera shots. the light flashes are unapparent on the pictures but you can see the object do this in the short film attached. my camera is older and so the zoom does not function in video settings, so that was the best i could do. through the camera focus lens, i could see the object in more detail that did not translate, of course, in the pictures. it appeared to flash, was a glowing florescent greens and reds. it stayed so steady in the sky that i was able to use the bridges railings to steady the camera so i could observe it longer. it turned perfectly on a central axis at if the object was orbiting exactly on it's poles and not ununiformed like balloons or other object. it was so stationary it seemed locked into the position in the sky above a common point. we stayed there after i shot the pictures and footage for twenty minutes or more. we even ask the local passer-byes if they knew what we were looking at. none knew what we were seeing. i felt invigorated because i love a good mystery. we eventually just walked away out of boredom because the object never left or moved from the area far. i could tell it had a minor flight path and in the twenty minutes we watched it, it stayed the same elevation but just barely drifted horizontally. the drift was totally un-noticeable visually. the drift was like watching the speed of the big hand on a dial clock. \r\nafter a couple of years i was examining the photos with some friends and that is when i noticed the other anomalies in the background similar to the object and in the same relative positions. almost seemed like a group of observing probes or something of the sort.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

regarding this case. as i have stated previously, it seems to be an ongoing issue and it appears that all i need to do is step outside at the hour i go to work with a camera and record while i work as best i can.\r\ni work a newspaper route in the county area, two routes i work back to back. i have always noticed strange things, and suspected close encounters and wanted to prove it. i'm not new to close encounters, going way back. one of the areas i deliver to is actually caddy corner to the neighborhood i grew up in, in the early to late 90's where and when i experienced a multitude of strange occurrences, or close encounters.\r\nso i've been making video of my route every day because of what i found on the video from last weekend, on 5-31-2015. what i've found is that nearly every video has at least one object or entity. i have discovered that i drive slowly and with my windows down, that if i have the camera pointed back over my shoulder they hover up to my window and appear to whisper and look into my car over my shoulder. i have observed that there are a large number of small objects which seem like orbs or an et version of a drone flying around street lamps or hovering and emitting light, going into and ejecting from larger craft. i feel like they're a version of r2-d2 if that makes sense. i want to explain them away to myself as drops of water on the windshield but i just can't accept that since there is often no drops of water on the windshield and when there are, light plays differently than this.\r\ni have noticed a lot of lights which follow my car which turn on and are not stationary or they aren't there the next night.\r\ni follow the same route every night, and there is some construction.\r\ni've noticed a lot of them tend to hover around on a version of a segway scooter, i actually might have a portion on tape of that.\r\nnear the cemetery, there are a lot of times where i will see lights in the cemetery, or what might look like heat lighting, and police will tend to patrol there or go near to try to observe.\r\nwhat really gets me is the stuff i don't notice until i watch it on the video when i get home, like when i point the camera up while i drive and see a ghostly vaporous object which appears and moves around then disappears, and i have no explanation for this. i often do not feel like i am truly alone although i tend to think i am the only one of my kind anyway.\r\nit's a cheap camcorder, with good low light, not ir, it's not a flir cam, it's a 100 samsung. it doesn't really pick up anything in the night sky unless it's a full moon. stars don't show up because of the optics, it's not a pro camera with premium optics, lets say. i record the sky, and it comes back that there are lights which move in unexplainable ways.\r\nearlier, i was driving and i noticed a metallic box shaped object i did not see with my eyes or notice until i got home. it appeared to hover and raise slightly, and there was a window and a being looking out, and the light inside appeared to be on. i sometimes catch a face or two from the sunroof if my camera looks up and down, even if just for a split second. i notice that the lights on the outside of the craft might light up in the same spectrum as the street lamps to blend in.\r\na multitude of evp's, what seem like whispers. they appear to know and understand my name, and can communicate in english. i often hear strange animal noises which seem to be speaking english from the darkness and out of my periphery, which sound like a screeching parrot or a wild raccoon or other animal. i sometimes encounter people in mundane situations like purchasing beverages from a gas station who seem to think i am talking to them, like earlier tonight, when two other people insisted that i repeat to them what i just said. i didn't say anything. it's as if they put on a costume and go about as us in regular everyday situations. i even caught a still of the gate guard from the neighborhood, a polite man, who appeared to have half of his face morph into a grey alien face, very clearly.\r\nall of this, not frightened of this. i report to work, i make a paycheck. this being an ongoing thing. at this rate, i'm going to run out of hard drive space to contain the evidence i'm gathering just by going about my daily routine with an inexpensive camcorder. i'm going to have to buy another external hard drive because i could end up with terabytes of data, pictures, audio, hd video. it's every night.\r\ni have a number of pictures and videos, i would gladly share them all with investigators in an effort to gain some better understanding of what's going on in the community and in my life.\r\nand i'm going to continue to record every day something new, and see about what i might catch in the footage. today i'm just going to upload a little bit of it, what i have from earlier today and from earlier in the week to illustrate that they come up to my car window silently hovering and whisper. in the video it sounds like an alien language, in my head sounds like perfect english, don't know why. was told the guy from last week who reached in to my car was reported as a prowler.\r\ni never felt comfortable to express i heard or saw things, because of what might happen to someone who doesn't have explicit evidence who says they hear or see strange things, and official policy to remove people and check them for internal wiring problems.\r\nthe video proves to me at least that what i'm experiencing is real, and that there's more that i don't see while i am focusing on work or driving as i go, and from the simple fact that the digital cmos sensor in the camera is programmed to refresh at a different rate than my naked eye, which presents a technical problem for any sort of disguising of an object or being that they apparently haven't straightened out or maybe don't want to.\r\nand it's every night. i could go out and record a little from every night, there would be something, i predict. something new, or more of the same.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

i am reluctant to tell anyone, because i don't want to be labeled as a crazy tin foil hat guy, but i know what i saw, and it was defiantly what the typical alien looks like i'm assuming. it was absolutely terrifying, and after reading online about other people's encounter stories, i am convinced that i have been taken by aliens.. how does someone rationalize this???
