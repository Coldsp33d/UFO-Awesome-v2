States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This incident occurred the following morning that i witnessed two simultaneous star-like light orbs descend in an arc-like fashion withi the same vicinity as this incident.  this sighting began when i got up and early in the morning for work.  it was still dark outside.  i went in the kitchen and turned on the dining room light as i entered our kitchen.  i did not turn on the kitchen light, as i allowed the background light from the dining room to illuminate the kitchen sink area where i stood.  i was getting ready to turn on the coffee maker when i noticed that it was incredibly dark outside.  i noticed that the street lamp that is within view from my kitchen window was off, as well as my carport light.  i wondered if the power had gone out and looked behind me to glance our the sliding glass door where the downtown area was illuminated.  we live on a hill.  i then realized that the power had not gone off because i had the dining room light on.  as i looked out the window directly above the kitchen sink where i stood, i noticed a single column of light shining across the street.  my first thought was that our neighbor left his garage door open because it was an different type of lighting, like a synthetic cool-white fluorescent light and not warm in shade tone.  i realized that based on where the light was coming down, this tall block of light could not have been a garage door because our houses are not spaced directly across from one another, but adjacent.  my direct view is to see in between my two neighbor's houses.  this made me feel very strange, as though i had vertigo, as i thought about this realization.  i stared continuously at this light and did not move.  i suddenly had the urge to look at the time on the oven display, which read 4:44.  i looked at the light again and said quietly to myself, \"what is that?\"  i felt the need to just stand and stare.  because of the window and blue oak tree in our front yard, i could not see where the light was actually eminating from.  i do know that the trees within the light were not fluttering about as though a helicopter was shining a spotlight.  it was silent outside.  the light did not move at all.  i felt like i could not look away and actually was unsure how long i actually stood there.  i am assuming no longer than five minutes.  as i stretched my neck forward close to the window and looked up toward the left to find the street lamp, i suddenly saw the light slowly turn back on.  i glanced back toward the center of my view and noticed that our carport light was back on as well and the column of light was gone.  i was stunned.  i later thought that it was very odd that i didn't have the urge during that whole time to grab my camera.  i didn't want to do anything except stare at it.  i never saw what was actually projecting the light.  i only saw the column of light and this is very odd because there are no lights or motion lights there.  it was coming from above, anyway, directly in between the space of two houses...No more and no less.  the largest wintu settlement of california  lived directly under our hill.  thousands were intentionally poisoned by kit carson (a pioneer) during a settlement many years ago. a \"friendship feast.\"   i know the whole area is spiritually charged.  there are are also large power line towers up here in our neighborhood.

in nov. of 1966. \r\nwhile standing outside around 5:30 am, in line for the chow hall, i was looking up at the sky which was very clear and it seemed like a lot of stars were out. \r\ni noticed what seemed to be a meteorite going from my right to my left, and as my eyes shifted to follow it, it wasn't there. i shifted my eyes back to the area to my right and noticed what looked like a slightly brighter star in the area that i had last seen the meteor. i was just looking at that when it went off across the sky to my left at an amazing speed and stopped in an instant. i said something about it to a few of the closest guys to me, and they looked up in the area where it was. then it went from left to right about the same distance it had gone from right to left, but was further away from where i first observed it. it stayed in place for a short period, and then came back to near the first place i saw it. then it went up, like a meteor going in a reverse direction, until it was out of sight. \r\n what i observed made like an elongated triangle, made four stops, traveled at an amazing speed, and could stop in an instant. the stops may have been for app. 4-5 sec. each, and what i observed was probably around 30 sec., give or take a second or two. \r\ni didn't report it at the time! figured i would still be locked up in a padded cell, or they would have thought i was trying to get out of the service. \r\n one interesting thing i found out later in a readers digest article: there was supposedly a team of ufo experts at that facility when i was there.?? \r\ni don't know what

late night walk to the side of a river. we were standing in a line a few feet apart on  rocks at the side of the river. there were large electricity pylons about 500 yds from the other side of the river. it had been almost pitch dark and we needed torches to walk through a wood to reach the riverbank. suddenly it was like daylight and we looked up. we saw a large (approx. 150ft across) glowing, white spherical object approach us from the north west. it hovered towards us and stopped about 70-100 ft above/in front of us. there was a very faint buzz. it stayed there for about ten minutes as we looked up in disbelief, mouths open, unable to speak. we glanced at each other but could not talk. at some point in the middle of this we observed 4 small white objects come off the main object and disappear. they emerged from the object at the 3,6,9 & 12 o'clock positions all at the same time.  the object then moved slowly to the west for about 300 yards. it stopped for a few seconds and then accelerated to the south so fast, that it disappeared in about 8-10 seconds. it must have been doing 100,000 mph? i had often seen military jets flying over very low, in the area doing 1000 mph+, but this was something else entirely and i knew it was definitely not of this world.\r\n\r\nwe told a few people at the time but they laughed and ridiculed us so we stopped talking about it. i have lost

silvery with several lights that emerged and flew about the larger object.  when i was able to glance at it again it was at that time it suddenly disappeared or became invisible.  we were both

occupants. it was my friend who was with me who was frightened and that was due to him seeing my body lighting up and his seeing it like i was being x-rayed. he later apologized for his having taken off running; which he didn't as it was much later upon their releasing us that we took off as fast as we could high tail it. \r\n\r\nstill i don't believe they meant to harm us in any way - just wanted to examine us and we most likely would do the same if we were in their shoes. i believe since i haven't kept accurate records of my sightings number 14 or more. i have been fortunate since i have been able to photograph and videotape most every sighting other than three of my fourteen or more different craft. on those three occasions two were sighted when i didn't have a camera with me

phenomenon (i do not remember which),just when i thought that the time for observing it has finished and that i arrived late,i saw a brightly glowing light about the size of a golfball moving high above in the sky.I thought it was the astronomical phenomenon i wanted to observe at first but i only realised my mistake when it moved.Then i thought that it was a plane but it was too slow for a plane.It as mentioned before, moved with a slow pace and it also had a golden aura which surrounded it.Though it was almost the same color as this strange egg-shaped object,it can be distinguished if observed keenly.I spotted the object in the west,and as i was observing i felt a sense of incompleteness,vagueness,ambiguity,curiosity,and a strange feeling which is indescribable.I also felt a sense of being observed as i watched it.I also felt like some sort of intelligencee was reading my mind.It faded away into the distance as i watched it with the same slow pace i described before.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
