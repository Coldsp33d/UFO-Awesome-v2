1977 and watching a movie together and over my shoulders through the parted curtains of the window behind me on the couch i see this stream of light like a falling star that fell from at the top of the window clear down to the bottom almost, so i told everyone i seen a strange light like a falling star that was moving across the sky, but it was so much slower than a falling star etc.  i went outside immediately to look in the direction of the light and at first seen nothing, then it appeared, this ball of orange/red light at night hovering slowly toward my direction and then it stopped shortly what seemed like about 500-700 feet away or so, then it moved west from me going away and slightly downward. i ran up my drive way and tried to climb upon a fence to see it more. then this ufo with no noise at all, just flew off like flash of light, lightening up the whole sky and followed by a sonic boom. when hovering, this thing was making no noise at all. i ran into my house to tell my wife and friends and my man friend and i drove down another road trying to see if i could find what i had seen and nothing. i suppose it was gone by then. to this day i feel i had seen a real ufo, because for that year of 1977 i had never seen any aircraft as such at night like this and without the noise. everything else like airplanes, helicopters etc have sound. whatever this thing was it left fast and the neighbors all heard the sonic boom and it made all the dogs bark right after that. from all the descriptions of other, people's ufo's this one was similar to them. i am not sure why this thing appeared as basketball size to me, but it was at least 500-700 feet from me going through the tree's real low before it disappeared. the next few days a friend had said that he was told that other people had seen what i had seen that same night. this has never left my mind all these years trying to imagine what it might have been, since never seeing anything ever to match what i had seen since then. i do believe in ufo's from afar or today maybe the government has them, not sure yet.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

mother and we both decided to sit outside on her back deck and enjoy the warm weather.  it was exceptionally dark and, living in los angeles, i noticed that the sky was clear and you could see an abundance of stars.  the time was approximately 9:30-10pm on 7/19/14.\r\n\r\nas i'm looking at the big pine trees surrounding her neighbors' houses, my mother comments on an airplane that is flying across the sky.  the object was far enough away that i could not detect a shape, size, etc.  it simply looked, at that time, like an airplane in the air flying at a distance with a solid white light.  the object was flying in a straight line, but much more quickly than an airplane would that far away would.  normal circumstances would dictate that, at that distance from the earth, the plane would appear as if it were flying very slowly for those on the ground.\r\n\r\nthe object flies across the sky at a steady, quick rate for approximately 3-4 seconds and stops in mid-air.  it doesn't appear to move, just stop dead in its tracks.  we stare at the object and each other and comment on the fact that the light/airplane is stopped in mid-air.  2-3 seconds later, the object's light starts to brighten in strength and intensity so much so that the light becomes unbelievably bright and you're almost forced to look away.  it was a steady increase and did not pulse, etc. it was a consistent brightness.  but at the distance away from the earth, it would not have been too noticeable unless you were specifically looking up in that direction.  the neighborhood is very quiet, and i didn't notice any activity that late.\r\n\r\nbefore we could comment on the object again while it was stagnant in the air and the white light intensity had increased with such immense power, the object suddenly and without warning took off at a very, very quick pace.  from my perception on the ground, the object appeared to travel away and up from me as i could see a slight tail in the light before it completely disappeared out of tight within just 2 seconds.  the speed at which the object accelerated and disappeared was astonishing.\r\n\r\nmy mother and i both looked at each other in disbelief.  we did not hear any sounds, see any other colors from the object except a while, bright light.  but i do know that no manmade object can travel at those speeds, stop dead in the air for seconds on end, and then abruptly and without warning change directions and accelerate out of site at an enormously quick rate.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

fianceé witnessed a strange light in the sky. the light would appear randomly between midnight and two am. it would hover over the ocean. it happened about three times over a week. my mother and i had witnessed a star like light, that would flash random colors, that was stationary for an hour or so fly over us. it was triangular and left bizarre light streaks. i ran inside grabbed my dslr camera and took a photo to only have  a row of four light streaks with a dot in the middle. the pictures mysteriously disappeared. within minutes military jets were out and helicopters. on the last night of the event i tried to capture the star like ufo light and my camera refused to take photos, then i used the stargazing app to see if a star was in that spot and my phone died. i had several photos of the light being in different positions, colors, and streaks and they weren't on the memory card when loaded. on the second night of the event my friend and i were walking on the beach looking for shells when the light appeared at random like before. it was flashing bizarre patterns and changing elevations. i have never seen a star do this, also there were a couple of planes that passed over head before and the light patterns were no where close. my friend and i had led lights, and thought it would be funny to flash sos like patterns. all of a sudden it changed light patterns and elevation, then an orange spot light like light reflected off the ocean's surface. then soon after disappeared. no star, plane, nor flashlight reflected that color or way. no plane or star reflected that light. the moon didn't even reflect that strong. the only photos i have are taken with a cell phone. they are low quality(pretty much worthless) and only show the light in they sky in one photo and not in the next, accompanied by the star gazing app that shows no star was in that section. the star gazing app was very accurate. it lined up almost perfectly with other stars in the sky. pictures are labeled. the first label is just the black sky, and a minute later the second photo shows the light. the third shows the star gazing app and how it shows the absence of a star.

knowing exactly how, (i guess it was because of the interest i’ve always had in astrophysics), that my life started centering around the ufo phenomena. as well as anyone with a deep interest on this kind of subject, i’ve always dreamed of having a true ufo sighting experience, although this was something i was doubtfully sure of, until something happened on the month of august 2013.\r\none day i went to meet with a chinese colleague of mine to this hotel where he was staying at in downtown la paz. during the morning hours, we stayed in his room talking a bit about everything, and as the tv was on we started watching a rerun of the ufo hunters series on the history channel, while from time to time i was translating to him from spanish to chinese the most relevant and interesting of the contents that were discussed about the ufo phenomena.\r\nat around 5:00 in the afternoon, we took a taxi straight to the airport to change the departure date of our flight to colombia. at around 08:00 in the evening the same day, we took another taxi from the airport back to downtown la paz, riding down a quite long and winding highway, which links the el alto (city) international airport located at an altitude of 4100 m.A.S.L., with the city of la paz located on a very large valley area at an average altitude of 3.850 m.A.S.L.\r\nsurrounding the upper part of the la paz city valley, there is a large mountainous chain that is part of the andes cordillera, which during moonless nights cannot be seen because of the height and the distance they are located at. the only thing that can be seen on one of these mountains at nighttime, are 3 quite bright yellow lights that are arranged in a left to right diagonal array, the ones which during nighttime seem to be suspended in the night sky.\r\nin fact, the previous year in 2012, as i was making my way back from the airport at similar nighttime hours, for the first time i noticed those 3 bright yellow lights suspended on the left side of the sky over the valley. thinking that those possibly were 3 ufos suspended in close formation, i asked the taxi driver what those lights were all about, and to my disappointment he told me those were the 3 main lights of a water reservoir that channels the water from the melting ice caps from the surrounding mountain tops and used as a main water supply for the city of la paz down the rest of the valley area.\r\nwhile remembering all that, and after discussing about the ufo topic during the morning hours, i was there watching again those bright yellow lights of the water reservoir that evening, and suddenly i decided to play a joke to my chinese workmate, making him believe that those reservoir lights were 3 ufos suspended in close formation, and see what kind of reaction i could get out of him, just for the sake of my own pleasure. i ended up feeling very satisfied finding out that my chinese workmate reacted in awe-striking amazement thinking that those lights were real ufos, while i was doing my best effort not to laugh at him loudly and making him find out it was a joke.\r\nwhile this was happening, i looked to the right side over the same mountain range, and suddenly saw 3 other bright yellow lights that were also arranged in exactly the same left to right diagonal array formation having exactly the same altitude and distance as the water reservoir lights had!; (possibly might have been apparent altitude and distance that coincided with the reservoir lights). now, those newly discovered lights were something i have never ever seen or known of before, and starting to feel a strange sensation inside of me, i fixed my sight on those 3 lights and noticed that they were around five times bigger than the water reservoir lights. those strange lights kept their formation and position for around 3 minutes, and then they suddenly changed their position to a perfectly horizontal one, keeping their new position and distance for around 2 more minutes. from time to time, i could not see those lights because of the trees and houses set on along the winding highway, but as we were driving along, i noticed that those light were approaching more and more towards our direction, as if knowing that i was observing them. then i pointed out to those lights and i asked the taxi driver what those lights could be, and after him almost hardly looking at them, told me that it was just a another airplane making its way to the airport. it took around 5 minutes for those 3 lights to fly from their initial location to a place close to where we were, which i guess was an approximate distance of about 20 km, which tells me that those light were flying at a speed of an airplane. as those light were just about over the highway, the lights changed their former horizontal array to such a way that i ended up seeing a perfectly hexagonal array of 6 yellow bright lights with a twice as big red bright light located in the middle of the hexagonal formation! to my surprise, i found out that instead of 6 + 1 separate lights/objects flying in hexagonal formation, those where the lights of one single black hexagonal ufo, which i guess was about 20 to 25 meters in diameter suddenly flying at a much slower speed above us heading to el alto city were the airport is, at an altitude by then of about 30 meters from the highway, making no noise whatsoever!\r\ni was so amazed watching this object hat i kept myself quiet without saying a single word to my chinese workmate, until the object flew past by and disappeared over the high plateau of el alto city. i finally don’t know why this sighting was never shown on the news or talked about by anyone else being a fact to me that it really happened and we were altogether 3 eyewitnesses to it!\r\nas this is the first ufo sighting experience i’ve had till now, after i file in this report, i will further analyze and estimate more accurately the initial distance and altitude that the ufo had from the location of the highway where our taxi was running at and the resulting speed the ufo flew at, as well as other details of the more accurate dimensions of the object, etc. i am willing to answer any questions that you might have in the most sincere and accurate way i can.\r\nby the way, i once remember watching a mufon tv program about a guy near philadelphia also saw an hexagonal-shaped ufo flying near his house during a rainy thunderstorm evening… could you please provide me with any most detailed information about this peculiar hexagonal-shaped ufo that i’ve witnessed, where they come from and what kind of aliens maneuver them, etc. i will most gladly and thankfully appreciate it!","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1

story of a 3 story barracks. i was in the back of the barracks around 2am on \"watch duty\". very tired i lad down in a empty rack and closed my eyes. i was startled when i perceived light through my closed eyes and sat up quickly thinking i was busted by a company commander or someone had the barracks lights on. when i sat up though there were no lights on and everything was quiet. i slowly walked to the aisle way and looked and listened for anything. nothing. i knew something was shining in my eyes so i walked the length of the barracks (maybe 150 ft)to the \"front watchman\". i asked him who came in to the barracks. he looked at me weird and responded no one.I told him i had seen a bright light and asked him where it came from. he said outside. i knew this was extremely bright like a flash light being directed in to my eyes and asked him what the heck was it. he replied that he wasn't sure. maybe a car.... i dropped it and we talked for maybe 2 minutes when i began to walk back to my posted area. i took maybe 3 steps and the whole barracks lit up light it was day light outside. i stood there looking at everyone in their racks wondering how they are not waking up to this bright light. i turned to the other watch and said there is no way a car is doing this and headed toward the windows that ran the length of the barracks. the bottom panes were frosted so you couldn't see standing on the floor. we jumped up on top of the radiators that ran down the wall and looked out the clear panes. we were in the second to last barracks on the base. just on the other side of the last barracks looked like an huge beam of light coming up on the far side of this last barracks. i try to explain it looking like a football stadium with light pouring out from the bright lights. after maybe 5-10 seconds of trying to analyze the light a long oval slowly appeared on the back side and steadily rose a couple stories above the 3 story barracks and then stopped and hovered in place. super bright white light. i could not make out any details anywhere within this huge object. just solid white end to end, top to bottom. i could feel reverberations, pulsating from the object. almost like a generator but very deep in tone and fairly slow in frequency.I could feel the window pain vibrating and even feel it in my chest. as i watched this and took it all in i asked the other watch what he thought it could be. he responded he had no idea and asked what i thought it could be. i said ufo and all he could do was nod his head. i studied it in the 20-30 seconds it was there trying to take in every detail. waiting for the next move when it just completely vanished. like someone turned off a light switch. no more sound and no other light. just gone. i was shaken from witnessing the event and my heart was racing. i knew i had just seen something unusual. we reported the event to the company commander the next morning and never heard anything about it again. we didnt get to investigate the other side of that barracks. we were in boot camp. i always wondered if the first time i saw the light if the object was actually descending. i went on to have a 7 year career in aviation. electrician on the f-14 and never to this day have ever witnessed anything close to this that would even begin to explain that night.","distance":"101-500

the sky long enough to know what belongs there and what does not. my greatest disappointment is that this experience was so quick i had no time to photograph it! you'll just have to take my word for it.\r\n\r\nas on most nights i was outside watching the stars. i was facing south and on the far outskirts of town so the stars weren't hazed out. i looked up toward a tree on the property and saw a \"blue star\" about as big as venus when at it's closest... pretty big, very blue and had white kind of light\r\nshining out around it. after 2 or maybe 3 seconds it began to \"open\". imagine looking at a clamshell headon when it's open wide. it has a center point of connection with ever expanding edges flaring out above and below it with no matter in between the edges of the top shell and the edges of the bottom shell.\r\n\r\nthis is as close to an anology of what i saw as i can come. as i watched the \"star\" (a star that clearly didn't belong there)it opened up and as i watched the blue center of the star became inceasingly smaller untill at last the \"clamshell\" closed and left no sign of the blue \"star\" i had just been looking at!\r\n\r\ni wrote my husband the next day to tell him about it and even included a hand drawn diagram of what i'd seen. he thinks i'm nuts but i know what i saw and it was nothing i've ever seen before, even after some 53 years watching the skys.\r\n\r\ni'll have to look for the saved letter to attach a copy of my sketch. sorry i didn't do that before posting to this site. one last thing... this isnt the first sighting i have had here in prescott, just the most remarkable. ive had one more experience and my now deceased mother had several encounters as well. prescott az. is pretty hot with
