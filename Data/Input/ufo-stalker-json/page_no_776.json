caught my eye. it was likely miles away. it looked like it was about the size of a large star. from what i could see it looked grey and it was wider than it was tall. i couldn't make out an exact shape or color due to the night's sky and i have excellent eye sight. it started about 22 degrees north. the light was singular and it didn't blink a single time. it began to head west. as it did so it began to slowly curve upwards. then it slowed down and shot upwards and back down about 10 to 15 degrees and shot back down within 2 seconds. it continued to the west. once it reached about 0 degrees north it instantly turned back around to the east without stopping or slowing down. at about 5 degrees north it shot upward and back down in a similar way and about the same height as the time before, but this time it didn't slow down before going upward. it then went east until it was out of sight. before and after i had seen several airplanes land, but only after the event did i see helicopters. i personally have never seen any object move in a way such as this. and i also have never seen a helicopter or any sort of airplane with a single green light. and also i must add airplanes and helicopters have blinking lights that aren't constant. and considering this is the 4th time i have seen unexplained objects in the san diego area, i'm beginning to be less skeptical. i believe if people would look at the sky every once in a while, they would see these kinds of things more often. if you're ever on the phone at night, look out your window at night. it's something simple that could help you witness something from out of this world.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

around 9 pm est and noticed a bright star like object in the sky. living in the path of the atlanta airport, we often see objects flying in the sky.  knowing which way planes fly overhead allows to identify interesting subject that may not be planes.\r\n 2. what made you first notice the object?\r\nit was extremely bright, and closer than any other stars.  we often see bright star like objects in the eastern portion of the horizon. \r\n 3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\na star\r\n 4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\nthe star like object was extremely bright and twinkling.  when i zoomed in with the camera, i noticed that the object was not a star.  i have trouble describing the object because i’ve never seen anything like it.  it was bright orange with black cloud like mist surrounding it. you can the black shadow type object move across the bright orange section.  it almost looked like it was cigar shaped.  the object moved because the bright orange visible part goes from a circle shape to a circle with an x in it. \r\n 5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\nwe’ve had several experiences with unknown objects in the sky, but this was the first time i was able to record the event.  our first real experience over a year ago scared the crap out of us, and now we are constantly looking at the sky for additional encounters.  \r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\nfirst, the object was bright and visible to the eye, but then it disappeared. however, the camera was able to still pick up the light from the object even though the human eye could not see it.  i had to stop recording when my 3 year old woke up.

many times and it is much brighter and faster than this was. later when i watched what i had recorded i was surprised to see an object, apparently in the path of the bright object, light up and seemed to avoid the larger bright object. then blinking out just as fast as it appeared. i don't think it was a deranged lighting bug but possibly a ufo avoiding another ufo. the reason i think the large white object was not a satellite and a ufo is because it did not travel in a straight line like all the other satellites i have observed. this object slowly curved as it passed overhead moving from a north direction to a southwest direction. as always this is just my opinion and yours is always final. i had to take a short clip because of the very large file size of a hd recording.

was a budding amateur astronomer so i was pretty good at using my telescope.  i called one of my neighbors over to look at the object in my telescope.  several more of my neighbors appeared and were anxious to look through my scope.  i was magnifying the object about 30 times.  looking through the scope, the object appeared as an off-white circular disk with a slight darkening in the center.  we observed it for about 20 minutes and finally one of my friends ran home to tell his father.  the father called the los angeles air force base but got a run around and was unable to report this to anybody in authority.  about 45 minutes into this, i looked back in the eyepiece of my scope and noticed the object now had what appeared to be smaller versions of it revolving around it.  each of these smaller copies had a puff of smoke coming out one end, like a \"vapor trail.\"  total number of smaller objects was about 5 initially but the number increased over the course of several minutes to about 15. all of my friends were extremely excited as we were well aware of the ufo phenomenon and we were of the opinion that we were actually seeing a ufo. i and my friends were only about 12 years old but my friend's father also looked through the telescope and was equally amazed, and mystified by the sight.  at some point i must have either bumped my telescope and was unable to reacquire the object, or the object had left the area and we lost sight of it.  i never reported this to anyone and never thought about it again until

way bigger and brighter than aircraft nav lights. the two lights stayed in a fixed position for about 15 minutes, right in the middle of the lightning storm. then suddenly, a third bright red light appeared below the two green lights, making a triangle. then after about 1 minute all three lights descended quickly below the tree line and disappeared from view. the rate that the lights descended was way faster than a chopper could drop from that elevation. my wife and i took several photos on our smart phones, but unfortunately the images had poor resolution (no surprise.)
