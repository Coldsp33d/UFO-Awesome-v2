every night for about five months. they appear at sunset. there are usually between four and five objects in the sky but do not produce enough light to photograph. there are two that are low enough in the sky to take photo's of and video. one of these ufo's produces a bright star like light. it is steady and does not blink. none of the ufo's blink they hover in the sky and make a very slow movement towards the north west. but you can see them clearly in the night sky. they have a clear difference between any satellites that are in the surrounding sky. with this report i am able to provide a few photo's of the lowest two in the sky. i am surprised that the object puts out so much light, but in a photo there is really very little to see. they just do not do it justice like witnessing this amazing thing with your own eyes. these are not drones. they are not satellites. these are the real deal. i believe that they are showing up, night after night. month after month, because they want the world to know they are here. showing consistency rather than appearing randomly as the reports have been made in the past. check out my photo's bring your own camera or video, come to boise. be ready to witness a possible new beginning for our world and reality. they will be here. shouting consistency for all to witness and begin this transition of our global consciousness.","distance":"501

east.  there were no clouds in the sky as i recall.  i watched the light only half interested since i have seen the space station go by many times.  the light was a grey color with no blinking lights, just a steady grey color.  \r\n\r\nas the light crossed the sky, at about the 1 o'clock position vertical it began to grow really bright.  as it grew brighter it seem to be either growing in size or falling straight at me.  the light was a golden white color and became hard to look at.  i became concerned that it was was going to crash right into me.  then, it began to shrink and returned to the small grey dot and continued towards the horizon and eventually faded out of sight.  the light was so bright that i feel certain that there must be other witnesses, which is my main purpose in making this report.  \r\n\r\nwhen the light faded out i felt no emotion about it at all.  i felt disinterested in it and went back in the house and watched some tv. \r\n\r\nthe date i have given is an

entire parking lot was glowing red-orange.  suddenly we looked up and saw a bright red-orange orb.  this was in the middle of the forest away from town.  we watched it for a few minutes saying 'what is it?', then i spotted it with my lantern and rings eminated from it like throwing a stone in a pond.  that scared us and we ran into the lodge.  inside (the kitchen) was my mother and the bartender.  my mother looked out the window (she was glowing red-orange at that point) and said something like don't worry its probably nothing!  then the bartender stepped outside the door to have a look.  he was dressed in a white shirt and black pants.  his shirt was bright red-orange. my friend and i don't remember what happened after that, it's a blank.  my parents sold the lodge about a year later and we moved away.  lost touch with the bartender and not sure if he is still alive.  i will be 70 years old in november and my friend about the same.  just saw a page on facebook about red orbs, i was impressed about the sightings described all over the world (i thought we were alone).  sure curious about that lost time and my friend does not remember either.  i don't think my friend wants to talk

dominos with our family friends who lived on the property behind ours. we lived in the sticks in texas, outside of a very small town. i was only 6 at the time but this is burned into my memory. i remember my sister running into our trailer house and she was white as a sheet and she could barely stammer out.. momma.. dad.. come outside now. all of us got up and ran outside and about 50 yards from the back of our trailer my sister had already arrived and was just staring up into the sky, it was quite obvious the instant we turned the corner at the back of the house what she was looking at. sitting there hovering no more than 50 feet above the tops of the trees (evergreen pine trees) was this gigantic triangle with reddish orange lights on each corner and a large one in the center. the large light wasn't originally lit up though, the other lights pulsated and then as they finished the one in the center lit up. i remember i was confused, and a little bit terrified. i remember my mom and our backdoor neighbors wife were both very very terrified and visibly shaking. i asked my mom what it was. she immediately said it wasn't from earth quite matter of factly as if there wasn't a question in her mind that it wasn't from here. i immediately knew she was telling the truth.. i just felt that this was something outside of our comprehension... and this was coming from a child who had just gotten his first video game console and was amazed by even that. we all sat there in perfect stunned silence for more than 15 minutes while the thing just hovered there without moving so much as an inch. then in a matter of a second or so you could see it start to move then *fwoosh* it was gone but there was a trail of the object as if you could see it still. it was so fast the light left behind showed a gigantic trail following in the direction the object went which was sw of the lat/lon i provided. many years later when we had moved into the city, my mother and i were watching unsolved mysteries and on the screen came the object we saw, we both began to get visibly upset as it still terrified us. it was reported as doing the same exact things it did with us, but it was over a german military base when it was reported.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

parking lot of an industrial building, and we all saw it.  i was the first to see it.  i just happened to be looking at the sky, it caught my eye and i thought it may have been an ultralight aircraft.  it had all the appearance of a delta-wing hang-glider style ultralight aircraft.  but it was white on the leading edges of the wing. the rest of the delta was either translucent or not there.  as i continued to observe it, it became apparent that it was a boomerang shape.  it was very high in the sky, over the clouds. way too high for an ultralight. over 5,000 feet at least. the object hung motionless in the air for a good 5 minutes.  it eventually morphed into a straight line, then into a ball, then back into a boomerang shape. it drifted slightly to the east while changing shapes.  after it changed back into a boomerang it started drifting faster and eventually was lost behind a cloud.  i searched google for an image and i found a story from 2012 that is the exact same thing i saw.  i did not see orbs, and i did not get a paranormal feeling.  i thought it may have been a weather balloon, but none of the images i found of weather balloons look like what i saw. here is the

is a business, they have a seven day subscription, it is my obligation to deliver a paper to them every day about 3-4am (approx.). i have a hobby and an interest in paranormal activity. i own a digital camcorder. i decided that on this night, i would drive through the cemetery and record with my video camera to then review later the footage for any clues as to paranormal activity. i drove through the darkened section of the cemetery where the grave sites were, about 6 minutes of raw video. i was the only one i know there at the time. it was a spur of the moment thing since i had previously captured evp elsewhere and suspiciously little at the cemetery and decided to investigate for that reason as well. i also noted no other cars in parking or anywhere else save for two vehicles owned by the funeral home, a hearse and a minivan.\r\ni first noticed the object when i had finished my routes and had arrived home. i plugged my camcorder into my computer and downloaded the video. i then watched the video and discovered that there seemed to be the presence of objects and entities in the video, aside from the spiritual orbs which i had expected to see.\r\nit looked like a triangle ufo, and the face of an grey alien, and at another point in the video, it was a hand of some kind coming down from outside the car to knock on the windshield from outside, and the images were detailed, so it appeared that the were non-terrestrial beings and images of one or more of their craft. this looks similar to some other sightings i had personally witnessed on other previous occasions.\r\nit appears that at first, the object seems to have landed in a darkened section of the cemetery near a large communication tower possibly used by a local cable company which is headquartered across the street.\r\ni was unsure of the lights possibly being a building of some kind, because it was possibly 300-400 feet away. i heard what i thought were disembodied voices similar to a distinct projected whisper, as if one were making use of their diaphragm while whispering.\r\ni made it as far as i wanted to go, to the gravesite of a relative. i then turned around and went back around to where the grecian catacomb building was, and then slowed to a stop to readjust my 150 lumen led flashlight to affix it to the side of the camcorder so as to have them in parallel. i happened to be pointing the camcorder in the direction of the object which is seen through the windshield. i have made every attempt to debunk this, and have failed to explain it as a reflection or refraction of any light such as an interior light or the flashlight. this was near the center of the cemetery and there are no lamps or lights in the area, only 1-2 lumen solar stakes low to the ground. i also noted silence or absence of conventional aircraft. the video also reveals possible beams of light making a similar projection to the flashlight but from a different angle than i was holding it, seeming to come from above my open sunroof, which i intentionally to view the sky.\r\nanother major detail is the alien looking arm which is shown in the video coming down to knock on my windshield from outside and above. i did not see anyone else at the time, and the video ended abruptly when i thought i left the camera rolling to have spare to trim in edit, there were also grunting noises and possibly someone speaking outside my car but i didn't hear that either. there was an abundance of strange noises like air coming out of a canister or an low moaning uh noise.\r\nthe interesting thing is that i don't recall seeing the object in person, although it being a cemetery, having thought i wasn't truly alone anyway. i felt watched the whole time, and surprised to see the what the video revealed as i didn't recall noticing those details at the time, which is strange since you would think i would recall some strange arm knocking on my windshield when i thought i was the only one at a cemetery at about 3am, i rarely see anyone else and i always see them far off.\r\ni also know this. i arrived at the cemetery at about 3am, and the video took all of 6 minutes to make, and then i was off and made note of the time after that a few streets away, and the time was about 3:30am.\r\ni also don't remember being taken out of my car or leaving my car at all the entire duration of the filming of the video, so it is hard to say whether or not i was taken, only suffice to say i have missing time and the video doesn't match my recollection 100%. in other words, what my eyes may have seen, and what the camera recorded, were almost two alternate versions of the same thing.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet,

it's been a disaster and we hadn't had a semi clear day in a month. there were large billowy clouds but mostly clear in some parts.\r\n\r\nthis wasn't a plane, a drone, this was a ufo, undeniably in the day. i never thought it was a plane. this wasn't some night blurb, i could see it clearly, i was surprised no one else could. i have a good camera on my phone but was too impressed, too unsure still at first, to in awe. i pulled over to watch it from my vehicle and it was  gliding, silver, not a disc, like a sleek, sleek zeppelin shape, not the width, just the length shape, very long, very very bright in the texas sun. \r\n\r\ni saw it glide across but made movements from up to down in some parts like it was unsteady, but it wasn't it was just able to do it without distress. no one saw. i saw, no one saw, it was so large, so impressive. i watched it and it went into a black cloud and never came out. it never came out the other side of it. it went into a dark cloud and never came out. it made me nervous, it confirmed it for me, any doubt i had left. i had no one to tell, it made driving in traffic to hold an appointment so stupid. nothing else i did that day or now, really means anything. \r\n\r\nmy family kept asking for a video and bummed i didn't have one, but what would it have solved? nothing. it means nothing. all it would do is confirm fear. i'm glad i didn't record it, no one disbelieved me, i called the police, i asked if this was reported, he said no. i couldn't believe it, it was so huge, so plain in the day. \r\n\r\nin south texas were used to drug helicopters looking for dope crops and ranches manufacturing drugs but in the days before this happened, i noticed black helicopters, flying lower than the dea ones. i didn't think anything about it until now, until you asked in the questionaire about the type of helicopter.\r\n\r\nthat night i went outside to let my dog out and the sky was clear and the moon was bright and full and i normally lookup while she's in the yard and i go over my day, i thank the lord above for my health and ect. but that night, the sky became a menace, an echo and i knew i would see it again. that's what i was left with. an extreme feeling of a soon return. like they know i saw. and that's ridiculous to my logic but i feel strongly about it. \r\n\r\ni saw a massive football field sized ufo in 1995 in southeastern michigan after college once but that is it, never anything else and i've traveled long lonely distances at night, never saw anything. except that time and this one and both affected me the same way. i feel like i need to gather all the deer i can to keep them from hunters. i feel responsible to hide animals away from harm. i don't know what that means and why such a large gap between sightings and why i care. i should be relieved. i don't know what any of this means. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
