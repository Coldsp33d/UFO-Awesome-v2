right in the back of my house. there are actually more than one, usually between four and five. the others do not produce enough light for me to get them on my cell phone camera. at first i thought maybe it was a satellite, but it is way lower than any satellite in the surrounding sky. and this one in particular shines way brighter. i was able to get it on my cell phone, but i cannot send it to any place other than my facebook page because it says that the file is too big to send to my email. if you would like to see the video please check out my post, and if it is gone by the time you investigate this i will repost it for you. this is an amazing thing. i believe it is a genuine thing. i have seen many documentaries about ufo's and have gained quite a bit of insight as to the realm of coincidental possibilities. i can assure this is not a coincidence. these ufo's appear to be on some kind of very slow cruise control across the sky and around the earth. the fact that they appear into the setting sun has really made it difficult to get photo's or video's because by the time the sun goes down enough to film they are out of range. the light however continues to shine. i have several video's on my phone from a few different days. the one that i posted on my facebook page has a stable blue light and a red blinking light at the bottom. the actual shape of the ship is illusive because there is not anything to light it up. there are only lights on the bottom and the top. it is amazing how it shines brightly like a star, but when filmed it is only two lights. there were two side by side the other night that had matching lights. i have a video of that one too but again it is difficult for me to send these things online from my phone. nothing has changed in all of these months, i would imagine by the time you get this report things will continue. i encourage you to come out here, bring a high quality camera and witness this amazing display. they are no longer hiding. they want the world to see them. this is the first step in a global awakening.

witnesses to this event. me and my sister were sitting at the kitchen table at about 1 am we heard a loud thump at the front of the trailor went and looked thinking maybe something had fallen or something but nothing was out of place. about an hour later we heard the same exact thump at the opposite end of the trailor, again we inspected and nothing was out of place. at that point we thought that maybe someone was outside messing with us. so we went outside and looked but all was silent and no one was around. we went back inside and just brushed it off. at about 3 am we were sitting at the kitchen table talking when we heard an extremely load roaring sound and feeling the vibrations. my sister looked out the window and said \"oh my god it's a ufo\". immediately i started screaming( like a little girl i am ashamed to say) because of past abduction experiences. then my sister started screaming also. all the screaming had awoken my youngest nephew who was sleeping in the back bedroom who was around 10 or 11 months old at the time. my oldest nephew who was close to 3 at the time did not wake up the whole time which is very strange because he was sleeping on the couch and we were practically screaming in his ear. anyways i just wanted to get the heck out of there and try to stop whatever was going to happen. my instincts led me to run and grab my youngest nephew because he was screaming. i was terrified but i couldn't just leave him. so i ran out the back door with him in my arms but waited for my sister(which was only seconds but felt like a lifetime). as i stood there the ufo was right above me roaring the whole time but with no wind heat or anything but the noise. it was so low i could have hit it with a rock just by tossing it. when my sister finally came out she was alone and i said what r u doing go grab (i don't want to use real names) your other kid so she did(she later explained that she felt that the children were in no danger that \"they\" were there for us. as she went back inside i ran to the next door neihgbors house and started beating on the door and yelling for him to wake up i even tried opening and kicking the door in because i was so scared. my sister or i had no phone that's why i went to the neighbor. all the while the ufo was just hovering still roaring very loudly. when my sister came out carrying her other child we ran to our parents house that was a few doors down because the neighbor never did come to the door (who later stated that he heard us screaming bloody murder then pounding on his door and he also heard the loud roaring but said he couldn't move that he was paralyzed)so i kicked my parents door in and ran to their bedroom woke them up and told them what was happening and my mom asked if we had taken lsd which was not the case. so i went to the phone and dialed 911 and hung up because i knew they probably wouldn't believe my story.Finally the police showed up and tried to say it was an airplane that they saw serial numbers on it which i know better. one of the officers said it was heading to a nearby airport but when i mentioned the thumps we heard the one officer seemed spooked and asked us about it then the other cop shushed him. i told the one officer to take me to that airport and show me because i knew he was full of crap. he threatened to take me to jail for \" false\" use of 911. if a ufo that loud and flying that low (not including my abduction experiences) isn't an emergency then what is? i know the cops had to have seen what we saw by the way they acted and i am 99 percent sure there are police records to prove my claims. the craft that we saw that night was triangle shaped with a yellowish light in each corner. dullish black in color about 100 to 150 feet on each side. some sort of dullish black dome on top. and about 8 to 10 feet tall. it emitted no wind or heat but did make a very loud roaring sound the whole time . it would take an incredible amount of energy for something that size to just sit stationary.

dinner. i only driven 4 houses down and for some reason i looked up. the sunroof in my jeep cherokee was open. i saw an object that i never thought could exist. it was so massive, my stomach tightened at the sight of it and my stomach still hurts today when i talk about how large it was. the thing that scared me more than the size was how quiet it was. i couldn't believe how large it was and i would have still never known it was there unless i looked up. the bottom of the craft looked like a crazy maze design like on the bottom of someone's shoe. i only saw one light on one of its sides as it flew over but i could still see the other side of the craft. i don't know how i did it but i never stopped driving. i think i was in shock and didn't know what i had seen. i went to buffalos and picked up our order of food and when i got home i put the food down and just sat and stared at the kitchen table. my boyfriend asked me what was wrong and i almost didn't tell him what i saw. i finally got it out and he told me i was tired and he didn't believe me. this was a few years ago and i'm with someone new now who believes me so i figured id tell my story. there are some things i still haven't told him, not because i'm afraid he won't believe me but because i just feel like a crazy person trying to talk about it so i figured an anonymous letter might help me.  \r\nsince that first sighting i've seen more ufos. and i've had many dreams about abduction (which of course could simply be dreams) but every abduction dream has been different. again these are dreams so please don't call me crazy.\r\nmy first abduction dream there was a very tall looking being in my bedroom. i screamed so loud and fell all over myself trying to get away. the alien looked like an insect. like a praying mantis. its skin didn't look like an insect though. it was wrinkly. like an old person who had smoked and gone to the tanning bed for way too many years. it looked like it didn't fit the body it was on. anyway, as i was screaming a female voice spoke in my mind and told me not to be afraid. there were two other shorter beings that were on either side of the insect looking one but i didn't see them too well. that's all i remember of that one.\r\nmy next abduction dream i was put in some kind of room with an alien. it had blue-gray like skin and huge eyes (just as most people describe i guess) it looked sad, almost ill. and for some reason i felt sorry for it. it was almost like it had been cast away from the others. i lay down behind him and kissed him on the back of the neck. and then he looked back at me with huge eyes, surprised. i told him in my mind that he was okay and i didn't care what he was.\r\nmy next abduction dream i just remember looking through a huge glass window at planets and the stars and i knew everything. i understood how the universe worked. i woke up that morning with everything on the tip of my tongue but couldn't get myself to remember.\r\nmy next abduction dream was a painful one. i was being tortured along someone else that i can't remember. two beings were trying to get inside of my head to see something. i resisted them through my entire dream and they were so angry. it was like i had done something wrong and they were punishing me or trying to find out what i had done. all i remember was i couldn't let them know something.\r\nmy next abduction dream i was taken and i remember screaming for them to stop trying to make me forget. that i don't need to forget. i begged for them to let me remember.\r\nmy next two abduction dreams i was being taught how to move objects with my mind. in the first dream i wasn't very good at it. in the second dream they injected me with something that made me so good at it that i couldn't control it. everything started flying off around me and it was too much. i remember how to do it. i know it's super crazy to say but when i wake up in the morning i still feel like i can do it. yes, its embarrassing but i've tried to move objects during the day and big surprise, nothing happens. because again, these are just dreams. at the end of the day i guess i just want to know if people have dreams like this. i have a constant horrible feeling everyday that i'm forgetting something very important. i feel like everything is on the tip of my tongue and i can't quit reach it. i haven't seen many ufos since that first sighting but whenever i see one i get a home sick feeling. i feel like i miss someone. i hope i don't have some kind of weird disorder. i have anxiety and feel paranoid about people following me or being watched. the feeling of not remembering or missing something has gotten depressing its honestly so bad. just looking for answers. but if i'm crazy, then i guess my next trip will be to the doctor to get some anxiety medication. i just hate taking medicine to solve something. maybe i'll just stick to watching cartoons on tv to avoid scary feelings and maybe i'll have no more dreams. anyway, thanks mufon for wanting to help and listening to peoples stories. all of us crazies gotta stick together! ;-)\r\n","distance":"101-500

many encounters i have clears memories of only parts of three of the encounters. the following is a description of what i do remember of those three encounters.\r\nnumber one: (1970) i was 10 years old\r\ni was living in geata, italy. my father was career navy. we lived there for five years. i would like to point out that at that we had no television and had not had television for well over a year or two.\r\none night i woke up to find several strange creatures standing around my bed and doing i do not know what to me. the beings themselves did not really scare me, i was not being harmed. what did scare me was that when they communicated the words were not heard by my ears but would just be understood as sound in my head. i was told that they were preparing me for future visits. i got up from the bed left the room and went across the hall to the door of my parent’s room. i told them what was going on. they told me i was having a bad dream and to go back to bed. i went back to my room. after a few more minutes i was “told” by the beings that they intended me no harm and that because they could tell i was afraid they would be leaving but that they would return.    \r\n\r\nfor twenty years after that night i had no further memories of their returning. i did though have many days when i would awake in the mornings and feel tired. i had a strange feeling that i had not slept much that night and that something had happened, i felt somehow violated but could not put my finger on why. as strange as it sounds i could not even force myself to dwell on the feelings. i could only recall things like trying to scream but nothing would come out, wanting to run but being paralyzed. i could not recall why i wanted to scream or run.\r\nnumber two: (1992) i was about 30 years old\r\nby this time i had come to realize that i was being visited by something at times but could recall very little about the visits. that all changed one night after a visit in a hotel in bandung, indonesia. i became aware one night that i was on a vessel of some kind, being escorted down a hall way by two beings that i was familiar with. i could tell by the curvature of the hall that the vessel was round. there was a door every so often on my right side but they were closed. if they had been open they would have been exterior doors. \r\ni finally got to a point to where there was a door on the left, it was open. across from that door was another exterior door. sitting next to the exterior door was a slightly chunky brunette woman who was without clothes. i tried to ask her to help me but as usual nothing would come out. she gave me a look that showed she also wanted help but could offer none.  \r\ni was escorted through the door on the left, into an examination room. in that room there was an examination table perpendicular to the door with two beings standing with their backs to us. they were standing at the foot end of the table. across from them, on the other side of the table, facing them was a tall being. i knew him to be the one in charge. on the same side of the table as the tall one but with her back to me was another being who i knew to be female and i was very familiar with her. i got on the table.\r\nthe tall male then communicated by saying hello and telling me to not worry that i had nothing to fear. he then went on to say “you remember cela, she has be there every time we have visited you”. at that time a few things happened all at once. she turned around. one of the two beings now on my right at the foot of the table said “she is there every time because having someone familiar there makes them easier to control”. she stepped towards me saying “tonight we are going to do sex things, you like that.” i then reached up with my left hand and grabbed her around her skinny neck. i squeezed as tight and as hard as i could, i had her good, she was in trouble.\r\nthen simultaneously the tall one asked “how has this happened, i thought we had control of him”. the two others responded “i don’t know, we did have control of him; we thought we had control of him”. then for some reason my hand just opened up and released her. the tall one then grabbed her to keep her from falling, she was hurt bad. the tall one then said “return him; return them all”. it turned out there was seven of us.     \r\nthe next thing i recall was standing behind some bushes as one of us was returned to their place. i do not remember how they were returned but i do remember my own returning.\r\ni was staying in a building separate from the main hotel. at the front door of my building was small entrance way. to the left was stairs heading up to my level. to the right was a karaoke bar. the two beings escorting me stepped through the entrance way as a lady who worked at the karaoke bar stepped into the entrance way. she just kind of went blank and stood there. as i stepped on to the stairs heading up to the level of my room she kind of like unfroze and looked at me. it was obvious that she was confused. i think to her i had just appeared there. i kept walking up the stairs, she stood there confused.\r\nmy two escorts and i made our way to my room. the next thing i knew i woke up in my bed with a great since of accomplishment! i could remember most of what happened the night before. i felt like “wow i got her”!\r\nafter that night i had years where i felt they were no longer visiting me. then i became aware that i was wrong. they were still coming but they had a new trick.\r\nit became clear over the next several years that they were still visiting me but now they caused me to interlock my fingers, try as i might i could not pull my hands apart.\r\nnumber three: (2009) i was about 48\r\nthe last memory i have of them coming to visit was four or five years ago now. on this occasion i found myself outside my parent’s house in alabama with several beings around me. their craft was sitting next to the woods; i was sitting on the tailgate of my truck, with my fingers interlocked. my dog was there and unfazed by the beings. i was told that they would no longer be visiting me and they were there to remove something that allowed them to find me. i was told they were giving me some kind of information and was told that when the time came i would know how to use this information. i have no memory of what this information was.      \r\nthat is my story.\r\ni would like help in remembering more, but i don’t know how to go about finding that help.\r\ni am not looking for any help with paying for any help i could get in retrieving memories. i just want to be pointed in the direction to find that help.\r\n","distance":"21-100

on the west side of mcfarland, on the phone. the night was clear, and cool.  at this time, i was living on the southwest side of madison.  during the conversation, she mentioned that 'they' were back.  when i asked who 'they' were, she said the ufos.  she said they appeared to be over the lake (lake waubesa).  i looked toward that direction, east-southeast, and i saw 2 - 3 bright, blue-white lights traveling in a vertically-oriented, elliptical pattern.  the highest point of the 'orbit' was about 60 - 70 degrees above the surface of the deck, with the trees/houses obstructing the view to about 30 degrees of elevation.  at times i could see 2 objects and at times i could see 3 objects. while my friend and i were discussing the lights, her sister called her to tell her that the ufos were over the lake (her sister also lived in mcfarland). both my friend and her sister had seen lights similar to this on a few prior occasions.  we watched the lights for around 15 - 20 minutes, and then they just disappeared, like they had been 'turned off'. both the lights and their flight pattern were unlike anything i'd seen before.  the lights were a bright blue-white, and glowed, with distinct edges.  the lights were a little smaller than a quarter held at arms length. due to a prior experience, i called mufon investigator beverly trout, and discussed this sighting with her.

fog had also move on as well.  we did see a few planes flying at cruising altitude and we are between some airports in the area so seeing a plane with it's landing and/or marker lights is normal for us as they'll int typically be decelerating for final approach around here.  these weren't any planes that we've seen before and when they disappeared they appeared to pick up speed to a point that

was making its path.  it appeared to be moving from right to left but that movement was not visible because it would disappear and reappear as it was moving.  after watching for approximately a minute, i called another person to see the object.  at this point, we both viewed it from the balcony moving quietly without sound or emission. as it moved from south to north we saw a green flashing light in addition to the glowing red orange color of the object. we were both uncertain as to the sighting of the object and really did not know what we were seeing because of the size of the flying object, the manner in which it hovered and appeared/disappeared, the red-orange glowing color, the lack of sound, and the closeness of the object. the orb eventually disappeared as it was making its way up the coast. i really don't know what this was but i wish i had taken a video.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

well below the object.)  the object seemed to hover for 5 minutes as i watched. then the object grew fainter, fuzzier as it appeared to be ascending.  eventually, the object disappeared.  it did not
