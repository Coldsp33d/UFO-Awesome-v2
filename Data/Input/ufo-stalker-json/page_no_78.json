bisabuelo fue uno de los ingenieros que contruyeron el telégrafo del presidente roca, así como las líneas y las viviendas y puestos a lo largo de toda su traza.\r\nmuchas de estas construcciones ya estaban listas para el año 1900 y por distintas razones se demoraron bastante en ponerlas en marcha em 1905.\r\ntodavía tenemos las libretas de campo del bisabuelo, quien por esos años tenía unos 30 años y había llegado a la argentina contratado por el gobierno para esa obra y otras en otros lugares del país.\r\nlas casas en lo que él llama la \"posta telegráfica mazarredo\", que en realidad era una estación telegráfica y no postal, y que mucha gente confundía el nombre y le decía la \"casa de los carteros\".\r\n¿vieron las películas del viejo oeste de e.U. donde al lado de las vías siempre hay alguien que envía y recibe telegramas?, bueno en mazarredo era igual ya que el telégrafo del pte. roca iba a la par de las vías del ferrocarril.\r\nen las anotaciones del 13/2/1904 el bisabuelo escribe que estaba alojado en la posta mazarredo y que al mediodía estaban preparando el almuerzo cuando sintieron que los perros afuera empezaron a ladras y aullar muy alterados.\r\nentonces uuestro bisabuelo miró por las ventanas que daban en dirección al mar y vió muy cerca de la casa, el escribe como a unos 100 pies, dos pequeñas figuras pequeñas como duendes del alto de un postr de alambrado (algo así como 1 metro).\r\nescribe que estas figuras eran difíciles de ver porque se veían borrosas pero que brillaban con un color celeste muy brilante.\r\ndice que se parecían a personas comunes pero de talla mas pequeña, casi como niños, y que estaban parados ahí muy cerca de la casa y los perros.\r\nnuestro bisabuelo escribe que salió de la casa y fue al encuentro de estas dos figuras pero a medida que se fue acercando a ellas entre los gritos de los perros, éstas se empezaron a alejar en dirección al mar.\r\nescribe que caminaban de una forma extraña como si no supieran hacerlo y que cuando avanzaban parecía como si se estuvieran deslizando sobre el hielo, aclara que no había ni hielo ni nieve y que el sol estaba radiante.\r\nagrega que las figuras hacian un sonido smilar a un chasquido seco.\r\ncuenta además que le costó tranquilizar a los perros junto con la otra gente que vivia en la casa.\r\ntermina escribiendo nuestro bisabuelo que estas figuras le hicieron acordar a los relatos de seres fantásticos que su abuelo le contaba cuando era niño de historias de los nativos americanos del oeste de los e.U. y que su padre decía que se parecían mucho a las historias de duendes y hadas de las islas británicas.\r\ndice además que mientras él estaba afuera uno de los encargados de la casa tomó una fotografía desde adentro con una cámara de negativos y que despues le pediría una copia.\r\nno pudimos todavía encontrar esta fotografía porque muchas cosas de la familia no están aquí, pero trataremos de hacerlo.\r\ngracias por permitirnos contar esta historia

the years, and thought gee this one is much brighter than normal of those i usually have seen. object was moving from north to south on a slight angle. it got about ene, just above a pine tree, i used as a reference point, with no tree limbs obstructing my view, and the object stopped dead, hovered for a minute or so, then changed direction 180 degrees to the north. it went a short distance, say about an two inches or so in the sky, a decent distance that i could gauge, and stopped again, reversed again 180 degrees, went about half the distance back the same path to the south, and stopped again. it then did a small circle, say about a 1/2 in in diameter, kind of wiggling as it went in the circle. it then continued on a path to the south and stopped. all the while i was watching i could not believe what i was witnessing, and wished i had my phone. once it stopped, i watched a minute or so, and since it was still, i ran inside to get my phone, my wife asked what was the problem, as i was almost running told her i am watching a ufo and wanted to get my camera. i had took notice of the position, using he pine tree as a maker, it was about 5 degrees above the tree, in a very clear sky. when i got back outside, no more than a minute, it was still in the same location, but perfectly still. it never moved again, while i was watching for the next 5 minutes. wife was probably rolling her eyes, as i pointed it out to her, but it never moved again. after 5 minutes, and since it was about 14 degrees , i went back inside. while i was outside with the camera, i tried to record

un momento leí este texto que al parecer está mal localizado, fue subido como el caso 88782 mufon en panamá, pero corresponde a la patagonia argentina, en la provincia de santa cruz y está relacionado con otros casos de la zona.\r\npor eso me tomo la libertad de volverlo a subir en la localidad más próxima que menciona el texto.\r\nel mismo relata lo siguiente:\r\n\"yo vivo en la pequeña localidad de jaramillo que queda sobre la ruta nacional 281, muy cerca de la ruta nacional 3, en la provincia de santa cruz.\r\nme gusta escribir y además acopiar relatos históricos de la región, acá hay muchas historias olvidadas que apenas se conocen y que la explotación minera y petrolera que destruye todo a su paso se encarga de borrar para siempre.\r\nleí el informe de mufon 88710 que habla sobre unas personas y vehículos con un signo extraño en la bahía de mazarredo.\r\nyo vi esos 5 vehículos pasar por jaramillo el día 6/12/17 rumbo al sur ya entrada la tarde, iban todos juntos y muy rápido por la ruta, solo los vi un par de minutos.\r\ntambién leí el informe de mufon 88754 de alguien que también vio esos vehículos en la localidad de fitz roy que queda a solo 20 km al norte de jaramillo sobre la ruta nacional 3.\r\ndebo decir que ese informe está mal incluido en el mapa de mufon porque se colocó donde está el monte fitz roy en la cordillera y no en la localidad que queda sobre la costa.\r\notro informe de mufon, el 88161, muestra un signo extraño que alguien vio en tres cerros, mucho más al sur de santa cruz.\r\ntambién hay otros informes en mufon que hablan sobre personas, vehículos y helicópteros, experiencias de personas que cuentan lo que ven y que parecen coincidir en algunos aspectos de sus experiencias.\r\nla verdad es que un helicóptero o un vehículo 4x4 como los que se describen no pasan desapercibidos acá en sur de la patagonia, no solo porque la gente siempre está atenta a todo y nos conocemos todos, sino porque esos vehículos son carísimos y siempre llaman la atención.\r\npero vamos al tema, en mis notas de escritor y recopilación histórica he visto ese signo en muchas ocasiones, en diferentes vehículos yo diría que por lo menos desde 1980 en adelante y ocasionalmente en algún avión de gran porte.\r\nes coincidente algo, todos son de color blanco y el signo es el mismo y de color naranja tirando al rojo, a veces solo y a veces con alguna otra inscripción alrededor.\r\nhabía allá por el año 2002 en la ciudad de río gallegos, la capital provincial, unas oficinas que tenían ese signo, no recuerdo bien los nombres en ingles pero sí que eran laboratorios de algo.\r\ntambién en esa época había en la ciudad de comandante luis piedra buena, otra localidad de la costa patagónica un local con ese signo en una de las esquinas de su vidriera.\r\nno sé si estas existen todavía, aunque las vi personalmente.\r\nalgunos comentarios de gendarmes, policías y miembros del ejército dan cuenta de estos vehículos blancos en diferentes lugares de la provincia y la patagonia, también relatos de la armada y prefectura naval cuentan anécdotas, de las que claro, al no ser de primera mano no se tiene seguridad completa sobre su veracidad.\r\nlo que es seguro que en río gallegos hay gente que se ocupa de esta clase de cosas pero llegar a ellos es difícil porque aunque contesten los correos siempre conservan la distancia de una forma muy educada.\r\nme gustaría hacer una breve recopilación de la zona que tal vez aporte alguna claridad y que se podría sumar a los informes de mufon, todo lo que suma es bueno aunque tal vez nunca nadie los estudie en conjunto.\r\nel 21/10/17 a la noche se vieron una luces cerca de la costa de comodoro rivadavia de color azul muy intenso que subían y bajaban, luego se metieron en las aguas iluminando el mar desde abajo.\r\nel 24/10/17 pescadores de un pequero de altura que recaló por averías en puerto deseado contaron sobre un encuentro en alta mar con un helicóptero blanco, enorme y volando muy bajo en un mar agitado.\r\nel 27/10/17 un matrimonio que se encontraba de viaje por la ruta nacional 3 saliendo de caleta olivia en el paraje la lobería dijo haber visto cruzar la ruta a una figura casi transparente que parecía un fantasma, a tan solo 30 metros de ellos.\r\nel 30/10/17 un transportista petrolero fue seguido varios kilómetros por una luz de color rojo intenso en la ruta provincial 12.\r\nel 7/11/17 una pareja de adolescentes vieron un objeto parecido a una esfera salir del mar en horas de la madrugada en el paraje punta chaffers al norte de puerto

vivo en la pequeña localidad de jaramillo que queda sobre la ruta nacional 281, muy cerca de la ruta nacional 3, en la provincia de santa cruz.\r\nme gusta escribir y además acopiar relatos históricos de la región, acá hay muchas historias olvidadas que apenas se conocen y que la explotación minera y petrolera que destruye todo a su paso se encarga de borrar para siempre.\r\nleí el informe de mufon 88710 que habla sobre unas personas y vehículos con un signo extraño en la bahía de mazarredo.\r\nyo vi esos 5 vehículos pasar por jaramillo el día 6/12/17 rumbo al sur ya entrada la tarde, iban todos juntos y muy rápido por la ruta, solo los vi un par de minutos.\r\ntambién leí el informe de mufon 88754 de alguien que también vio esos vehículos en la localidad de fitz roy que queda a solo 20 km al norte de jaramillo sobre la ruta nacional 3.\r\ndebo decir que ese informe está mal incluido en el mapa de mufon porque se colocó donde está el monte fitz roy en la cordillera y no en la localidad que queda sobre la costa.\r\notro informe de mufon, el 88161, muestra un signo extraño que alguien vio en tres cerros, mucho más al sur de santa cruz.\r\ntambién hay otros informes en mufon que hablan sobre personas, vehículos y helicópteros, experiencias de personas que cuentan lo que ven y que parecen coincidir en algunos aspectos de sus experiencias.\r\nla verdad es que un helicóptero o un vehículo 4x4 como los que se describen no pasan desapercibidos acá en sur de la patagonia, no solo porque la gente siempre está atenta a todo y nos conocemos todos, sino porque esos vehículos son carísimos y siempre llaman la atención.\r\npero vamos al tema, en mis notas de escritor y recopilación histórica he visto ese signo en muchas ocasiones, en diferentes vehículos yo diría que por lo menos desde 1980 en adelante y ocasionalmente en algún avión de gran porte.\r\nes coincidente algo, todos son de color blanco y el signo es el mismo y de color naranja tirando al rojo, a veces solo y a veces con alguna otra inscripción alrededor.\r\nhabía allá por el año 2002 en la ciudad de río gallegos, la capital provincial, unas oficinas que tenían ese signo, no recuerdo bien los nombres en ingles pero sí que eran laboratorios de algo.\r\ntambién en esa época había en la ciudad de comandante luis piedra buena, otra localidad de la costa patagónica un local con ese signo en una de las esquinas de su vidriera.\r\nno sé si estas existen todavía, aunque las vi personalmente.\r\nalgunos comentarios de gendarmes, policías y miembros del ejército dan cuenta de estos vehículos blancos en diferentes lugares de la provincia y la patagonia, también relatos de la armada y prefectura naval cuentan anécdotas, de las que claro, al no ser de primera mano no se tiene seguridad completa sobre su veracidad.\r\nlo que es seguro que en río gallegos hay gente que se ocupa de esta clase de cosas pero llegar a ellos es difícil porque aunque contesten los correos siempre conservan la distancia de una forma muy educada.\r\nme gustaría hacer una breve recopilación de la zona que tal vez aporte alguna claridad y que se podría sumar a los informes de mufon, todo lo que suma es bueno aunque tal vez nunca nadie los estudie en conjunto.\r\nel 21/10/17 a la noche se vieron una luces cerca de la costa de comodoro rivadavia de color azul muy intenso que subían y bajaban, luego se metieron en las aguas iluminando el mar desde abajo.\r\nel 24/10/17 pescadores de un pequero de altura que recaló por averías en puerto deseado contaron sobre un encuentro en alta mar con un helicóptero blanco, enorme y volando muy bajo en un mar agitado.\r\nel 27/10/17 un matrimonio que se encontraba de viaje por la ruta nacional 3 saliendo de caleta olivia en el paraje la lobería dijo haber visto cruzar la ruta a una figura casi transparente que parecía un fantasma, a tan solo 30 metros de ellos.\r\nel 30/10/17 un transportista petrolero fue seguido varios kilómetros por una luz de color rojo intenso en la ruta provincial 12.\r\nel 7/11/17 una pareja de adolescentes vieron un objeto parecido a una esfera salir del mar en horas de la madrugada en el paraje punta chaffers al norte de puerto deseado.\r\nel 11/11/17 un fotógrafo que trabajaba para una minera vio un vehículo y 3 personas extrañas a la vera de la ruta provincial 47, al preguntarle si necesitaban algo uno de ellos le contestó

short video clip of 1 of 2 ufo's. witnessed also by my husband. i had been recording the sky all throughout the day in various locations in joplin. so while walking out of walmart we were looking & talking about how strange the skies are becoming while loading our groceries & getting into our vehicle. when a bright white orb that looked like it was made out of energy or white light came into view right where i was looking. they seemed to emit more from below which you can see in the video. it came out of nowhere & then another one appeared above it. then the one on top moved to the right of the first one in a motion that was almost instantaneous but not. it did not swerve or move off into another direction other than what i state here. they both pulsed with a bright white light which was more obvious right before the 2nd one moved. then they both pulsed & the second one was gone. i was pushing the button to record right after the 2nd one disappeared but the 1st one stayed put. you can hear on the video that i thought i lost it while aiming the camera. you can also hear the sadness in my voice. my husband thought it moved at one point but he hadn't stopped watching it. but it was just dimming. it is important to note that my husband never turned away so that we could accurately pinpoint any movement in case my phone caused me to lose focus because we just barely missed the photo/video opportunity in almost the exact same location on another occasion. last time we were just a parking lot (half block) away from this location. that was also reported to mufon shortly after. this time i made backups & gave them to other people before reporting as an added measure to not lose data. then the remaining one pulsed & was gone. the light pole from the parking lot obviously shows the distance & that it did not move when i moved the camera. also you can tell i thought it had disappeared which is why i stopped the recording but it actually ended afterward. i was excited & was trying to find it through a lens which is what happens when you are looking at a vast space through a small hole but we both saw it leave. it was really amazing. very pretty & was not like our other sighting in this area. last time (1-25-2017) that one was silver & had a different shape etc. this was more crystal teardrop shaped if i had to assign it a shape, with the bright light energy affect & was beautiful & awe like, not \"craft like\" for lack of a better analogy. it should be noted that the sun was setting & it was a sea of oranges, pinks, purples etc but not near them. an airplane was flying near enough to see it from the airplane going northeast. i remember it because i was counting planes which normally have chemtrails. this one did not.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":88780,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.06821434673396,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12152017-0005","longitude":-94.54584470705196,"occurred":1513270680000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1513302621000,"summary":"Saw

to me talking about my blood and dna. i first noticed tapping on the glass of the window my ex husband and i both went outside that is when the been been appeared on the lds church. i atomatically knew it was other beings because i had been receiving mental telecanises like messages. i remember hearing in the feild behind the barn almost like radio static all around. i was very excited to have this going on until i stared seeing shadows and other interactions in the home i remember glowing blue faces appeared right outside the bedroom. i felt as though i was directed to go onto hafb. i for some reason threw my keys in the trash can i was next to the flight command center it was a sunday. i brought my dog with me thru the building. later base police called my family because a family member happens to work there on base to come get me and the animal. i was taken to the hospital, i was trying to describe to them along the way of coarse it didn't make sense to them. i was hospitalized for 9 days on meds when i came more aware of my surroundings on day 6 a very tall close to grey looking entity, came into my hospital room. when i got up to walk towards it or her as it felt it vanished. after the hospital i did see a very large ship about 4 or 5 houses long appear in the clouds and disappear as i got closer. the doctor tried to diagnose me with skitzophrania then told me no i don't think it's that i think it's something else. i was just barely finishing my 6 of 8 yr contract with the military. p.S. while i was on dugway proving grounds i did see orange light balls in the distance during a training moving very far and fast from left to right as well as shooting staight up and slowly coming back down months prior to the event. do to the times of the sitting s i was not able to capture any photos or videos. there are more details but these are the best key points i could get across. i have a book that i wrote during the event but i'm unsure that it will
