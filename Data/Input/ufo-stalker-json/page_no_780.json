and other works)about ufo's and did believe in extra terrestrials and their crafts. that night i initially did not believe this family member because we were in harlem, n.Y. and i firmly believed that no ufo would be in harlem and that if anything they would appear over a mountainous region where the population was not heavy and near secluded power lines(electricity and magnetic forces). so i ignored the prompts to come see this object believing the family member was playing a joke. the family member began begging me to please come ans see this \"ufo\" as he called it. in harlem!! i thought again. i refused to look. the family member then frantically called to another family member to please come see the \"ufo\". the other family member went to the window where the first family member was seated and locked their eyes on \"something\". i observed both of them from the living-room couch i was on and observed both were very fixated on \"something\". i asked the second family member \"is there a ufo out there?\" the second member remained very fixated on whatever they were watching and only nodded in the affirmative to me but never looked at me and remained staring at whatever was in view. so, i said to myself they are both in on some type of joke on me but this was never a concerted prank before. so, i decided to play along and got up to see for myself. i looked out of the window nearest to me to their left. i observed a circular greyish metallic object turning as it moved. it was moving from north to south approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter and 20 to 30 feet in height. this object was only approximately 100 feet or less from my position and our top floor window was on the fifth floor of our tenement building. the object was no more than 20 feet above the rooftops across the street. this object, once i observed it, made a straight line reverse after passing a few feet past the window. still turning as it moved(went). this reverse action was very smooth!!! it then stopped and hovered directly opposite me while still turning. the turning motion was not in a complete circle. i was a math and science student and clearly observed a total turning motion of approximately 315 degrees. the two family members had now ran over to the  window which i was at and began to ask me if i now believed them. i was so shocked but amazed i firmly told them to be quiet to hear from the already opened window. i immediately while observing the odd non complete circular rotations  while it was  hovering that there was no sound being made by this craft. while it was rotating, i tried peering into the four to five fluorescent like window panes. i could not see anything but the bright white light from the panes. these windows helped me gauge the turning(rotating) distances. since we were on the top floor i immediately said to my family members to let's run up to the roof for a closer look. while running to the apartment door and then to the roof door(which took less than 10 seconds), i was scared but so amazed that i just had to have a closer look at this amazing silent aircraft.\r\nupon opening the roof door the craft would have been directly opposite the roof door but was now nowhere in our immediate view. when we searched the sky we observed a slightly tilted object rotating with windows passing the midtown area of manhattan at least five miles away. this may or may not have been the object we had just seen but i would say that with a very high probability it was the same craft. the first family member asked should we report this siting to the police or news. i quickly told the family member no because no one would ever believe that a ufo was in harlem and we would be laughing stocks or labelled crazy/lunatics. the first family member had told me he waited before calling this object a ufo because blimps also moved smoothly and slow turns but observed that this object did not turn to reverse but made a straight line reverse which was observed multiple times over at least a ten minute period which then prompted them to call me to see it and to verify his sighting.  after recently visiting the kennedy space center i would best describe this craft as an over-sized space capsule that can hover and rotate at the same time.

white with a bluish tinge. the entire event lasted approximately 1/2 of a second. the only reason i am reporting this is because the object itself, though matching the speed, was much larger than any \"falling star\" i have ever seen (it was about 1/8th the size of the moon) and it had a bluish tinge. the light from the object was very bright as well and seemed to be actually emanating from it. this was unlike anything i have ever seen in the skies above baton rouge, la.\r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and there was no \"trail\" left behind the object nor any sign, glowing or audible, of a crash

craft, which shape was attached by a straight angular line up to the rounded wing tips.  the tail triangle itself was very similar to the x-47b.  i was waiting to watch the sunrise about 5:30 am or so and looking to the southeast when they just appeared...Like they came through a portal from a different dimension or something...In front of and above the mountains in san francisco. the sun had not yet come up and they appeared from the southeast and flew very fast heading towards the northeast of the apartment. i was on the 6th floor (rooftop). they were not that far above me (300 ft or so) and they made no sound, even though they were traveling very fast. from where i was watching on the rooftop, the 39-story marriott marquis building is only a few blocks away. both craft flew side-by-side from their appearance until right in front of that building, not above it. one of them dropped back just slightly (30 feet?) as they passed in front of the marriott marquis and that is about where i got the best look at them, when they were directly in front of me and in front of the marriott.  they looked about 20 feet long from where i was and were very thin in height at the back and wing tips but they were thicker in the front and middle of the craft.  i am not sure if i saw a window/windshield on top of the craft as they seemed to reflect the coloring of the marriott building (which is glass at the top) as they flew near and then it front of it.  it seemed to me that the craft were aware of me and that is why one of the craft dropped back, just for a moment. the objects seemed to become invisible as they quickly blended in with the darker skies in the north above maybe angel island(?).  they seemed to be flying on a straight path from when they appeared, neither ascending or descending as they went, though their path may have been arched from the mountains to the marriott, but it seemed at the same approximately height above ground as when they appeared. it almost seemed to me like they were showing off, flying thru a large city and directly in front of apartment windows and assuming no one could see them.  for video of similar craft see the x-47b video here: [link

removed/cms/jpg] a rural area about 10 miles outside of youngstown.  my home was fairly isolated out in the country and located in the center of a wide valley rimmed by wooded hills.\r\n\r\nthe first was when my sister and her husband were driving me home from church around 9 pm and as we crested a hill before descending into the valley where my home was we saw a brightly lit cigar-shaped ufo hovering about 200-300 feet directly over my house (about ¾ mile away).  the weather was clear that night and from where we were we estimated the ufo to be about 20-30 feet long.  it glowed orange and had bright white portals which were ringed with pulsing bright gold lights.  at that distance we couldn't see if any beings were in the portals.  my brother-in-law pulled the car over to the side of the road and we watched it for about a minute before it just vanished into thin air.  it didn't take off and streak across the sky - it just vanished in place.  we couldn't believe our eyes and were all quite excited.  it was the first ufo i had seen although my father had seen several during his life.  i remember feeling apprehensive about why this ufo was hovering over my house.  when we got to my house we listened to the radio but didn't hear any new reports about a ufo.  but the next day our local tv stations reported that many people had called the police after they'd seen it.\r\n\r\nthe second ufo experience happened a couple nights later.  i was eating dinner at home around 8:30 pm when my sister burst in excitedly telling me she'd been abducted by a ufo.  she was ecstatic and said she'd been visited by extraterrestrial beings who'd communicated telepathically with her, telling her not to be afraid and that they wouldn't harm her.  they looked human.  she said she was scared to death as they took her aboard their ufo, but they were so loving and gentle that after the initial shock of seeing them all fear left her.  she asked where they came from and they took her to the ship's control room.  it was dimly lit and had a huge curved window where she could see stars whizzing by.  they showed her a star chart and one pointed to their home planet.  the next thing she knew she was back at home.  hearing her story i was so stunned i didn't know what to think.  i am a serious person by nature and knew that she could exaggerate at times, but nothing like this.  i told her maybe she'd dreamed it after we'd seen the ufo two nights earlier, but she vehemently insisted that it really happened.  \r\n\r\ni made her sit down and eat something, and she told me again about the abduction, what a wonderful experience it had been, and how she couldn't wait to see the extraterrestrials again.  suddenly she jumped up and yelled \"they're here!\".  it nearly scared me to death!  she grabbed a white throw i had on the couch and ran out the back door.  i jumped up and ran after her and saw her standing there looking up at the tree line and waving that white throw around.  she was yelling \"i'm here, i'm over here!\"  i was afraid my sister had lost her mind.  i looked but didn't see anything.  after a few seconds all of a sudden i felt a strange inner vibration, sort of like the feeling you get when you lean against a washing machine when it's in the spin cycle.  then an enormous black ufo slowly came up over the trees towards us. i was terrified but my sister was laughing and joyfully jumping up and down.  this thing was so huge that as it passed overhead it blotted out the entire sky from one edge of the valley to the other.  i couldn't see the sides or top of it because it was so big - only the bottom was visible.  it was absolutely silent.  it was triangular in shape with very dim dark gray rotating lights at each of the three corners.  around these lights were circular gear-like things which rotated in the opposite direction.  the bottom surface was highly patterned and textured with raised designs in geometric shapes, bumps which looked like braille writing, and channels of varying lengths and widths (years later i realized that these looked like a circuit board).  i felt as if i were paralyzed as i stared up at it, although whether this was from fear or from the ufo i don't know.  but my sister was excitedly talking to this thing as if she was having a conversation with someone inside the ufo.  we watched it for what seemed like about a minute as it passed in a straight line over my house and went over the trees on the other side of the valley and disappeared from sight.  \r\n\r\nmy sister and i went back into the house and talked about the ufo for a long time.  i was still in shock and after my sister went home i fell into an uneasy sleep.  in the next couple days there were news reports of people seeing a huge ufo on the same night that we'd seen it.  i've thought about my two experiences thousands of times and always reach the same conclusion - that ufos are real.  to my knowledge my sister was never abducted again.  she married and moved away and we lost touch with each other.  \r\n\r\nover the years the fear i felt of these ufo experiences gradually subsided.  however in the mid-1990s i had another strange experience where i felt as if i had been abducted myself, but can't be sure.  the memories i have of it are dream-like, disjointed and fragmented.  i still scan the sky at night but have not seen any other ufos. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

watched, my wife thru binoculars. as it got dark, it turned darker with the sky, with redder tints and simply faded into the darkness. i couldn't tell if it changed elevation, but my pictures might

things again and at the same time of day (between 6am-7am).  they looked like squiggly lines, sort of like weird clouds.  i thought that as i continued driving that i would be able to get a closer look at them, but as i drove they didn't get any closer.  they didn't move that i could tell.  it started out that i could see about 6 or so and then near the end of the 2 weeks i noticed off to the north east that there were several other of these \"lines\".  i am unsure how to describe them because i have nothing to compare them to.  i pulled over 1 day and tried to get a picture of what i was seeing but it was too blurry and showed nothing.\r\ni called my mom almost every morning to let her know that i was seeing them again.  she tried to get me to describe them as i was watching but i was unable.  i wasn't afraid but very perplexed.  \r\nthis highway is very well traveled and i often wondered why no one else was seeing this.  as quick as i started seeing these things, i stopped seeing them after about 2 weeks.\r\n","distance":"Over One
