i was attending the even with my girlfriend, when i noticed a star-like object pulsating at a high frequency.  in relation to me, the object appeared to be ~45 deg. above the horizon to the south of my position.  it also appeared to be at great distance, and probably ex-atmospheric.  \r\n     when i observed the object,  i wondered if it would move, and promptly upon thinking so, it did.  the craft began to move from a standstill, and traversed the sky very slowly (approx. 2.5 deg. every 60 sec); moving a total of about 25 deg.  the observation of the craft lasted about 10 mins. total, at which point it seemed to blend in with the stars and disappear.  \r\n     i had noticed a distinct feeling about the night in general.  the moon was brighter than almost any other time i've seen it.  the stars were also unusually bright, and the sky was perfectly clear, which is unusual for the city.  when i observed the craft, it seemed to be watching the event and keeping its movements subtle to avoid detection.  \r\n     i was able to distinguish this object from a star, a plane, or a satellite.  first, the frequency of the pulsating light was fast and irregular and seemed to change when the object began to move.  second, the object appeared at a standstill, then began to move, and later came to a stop again.  thus, its movements would clearly distinguish it from a normal satellite, because satellites are either geostationary or follow regular orbits around the earth (i.E. they don't start and stop).  third, the light was pulsating at a frequency that appeared to be 10-20 hz, which is much faster than any aircraft strobe light; aircraft strobes only flash about once every couple of seconds.  only the pulsating white light was visible; no red or green lights were seen.  therefore, it could not have been any type of conventional aircraft either.  \r\n     this leaves two possibilities.  either the craft was an extra-terrestrial craft, or it was some type of experimental exoatmospheric man-made craft with powerful maneuvering capabilities.\r\n   ","distance":"Over One

together, chatting idly. the day was warm, dry, with high cirriform clouds or mist of unusual extent and texture resembling at times wool or inverted sand dunes. i was facing eastward.  \r\nat approximately 1540, i looked up to the east-northeast to see a singularly bright \"star\" or \"planet\" at about 40 degrees above local horizon, to which i brought the attention of a and s. it shone steadily with a bright white light that easily shone through but did not cast light on the intervening clouds. a and i watched continuously for two hours as the object rose to approximately zenith. numerous passenger and mail jets passed on a plane below the cloud film and several left lingering trails. during this time, it seemed to variously take on a slightly oblong, cometary, or oscillating appearance which, without the aid of binocular or telescopic aid, we are forced to attribute to a trick of the eye. our observations agree on this point.\r\nat this point, we all left the house by car and observed the object from several locations in windsor and santa rosa (mendocino and college). we pointed the object out to several people in different locations, who all thought that it might be different objects ranging from balloons to venus.\r\nwe returned home about 2030, at which point, the daily heavier clouds and fog began to roll in from the ocean, at times partially or fully obscuring the object which, at this point was about 40 degrees above the horizon and setting. at about 2200, the object was lost behind heavy cloud cover which quickly progressed to overcast skies.\r\nthe object was a very bright white and did not change in apparent magnitude relative to the position of the sun. it was visible while the sun was high in the sky, suggesting a magnitude of at least -7. its angular velocity seemed to be somewhat greater than the sun, perhaps a bit less than that of the moon. it did not travel along the line of the ecliptic as the planets do, but took a path to the north of it, perhaps crossing the ecliptic at its northernmost node. ruled out venus, mercury, jupiter, saturn, near-earth asteroids, balloons, and man-made satellites as possible misidentifications. i have been an amateur astronomer and meteorologist for over 20 years and am confident in these determinations.\r\ni have attached photographs recorded with an iphone 5c between

wind and no one around that i could see. i crossed the river on the stepping stones. i remember being cross that i'd fallen off a stone and my right foot was now wet through. i continued up the quite steep path that took me from the river up the side of a hill. i gradually became aware that everything was really quiet, in fact there was complete silence. i couldn't even hear the river and that struck me as strange as it is an area i know very well and i know that i should be able to hear it. \r\nmy dog was doing her best to slip out of her collar to go chase rabbits when she suddenly stopped and ran behind me and cowered behind me, shaking like id never seen her shake before. that was when i heard the pulsing hum, very quiet at first, like hearing someone's headphones as they walk past you but it got louder and louder. it seemed to fill my head and i remember it made my ears itch inside. i was looking around me trying to see what the noise was. i thought maybe it was the forestry guys cutting trees but no chainsaw sounds like that. i could feel it spreading through my whole body, really strong pulses of hums and buzzes. i remember feeling very agitated and nervous and incredibly thirsty so i reached for my water bottle in my pocket. and that's the last thing i remember until i opened my eyes and to my horror i was laying on the ground, it was pitch black, raining heavily, my dog was nowhere to be seen. \r\ni saw flashes of white light passing me on my right hand side and suddenly realised i was laying on tarmac underneath something large as i was completely dry but everything around me was soaking wet. a bright light shone in my eyes and i heard a voice asking if i was ok. it turned out that the voice belonged to a lorry driver who had pulled into a lay-by on the motorway to eat his late night snack. before he had set off again he had checked under his vehicle as he'd previously hurt a cat that had taken shelter some weeks before. he helped me into the cab of his truck and have me a drink of tea and a chocolate bar. he then asked me if i needed help and could he take me somewhere safe. he said he was heading to leeds so i asked if i could hitch a ride with him. we looked for my dog but in the dark there was no sign of her so i reluctantly agreed to leave. i told the lorry driver everything that i remembered up until him finding me. i looked at the clock in the lorry cab and it said 3:46am so i looked at my watch but it had stopped at 11:07am. i didn't say another word and made my way home from the lorry drivers depot in a taxi in a state of complete bewilderment. \r\ni didn't tell anyone about the most frightening experience of my life until i met my fiancé. he laughed at me and said i must be mad or high. i've never taken any mind altering substances other than alcohol and i was completely sober - i was 17 at the time. \r\ni don't even know if i was abducted as i have no recollection of anything other than i have described above. all i know is i was walking my dog in the sunshine and then i wake up laying under a lorry over 12 hours later 50 miles from where i started. \r\ni know i'm not mad. i know what i heard and felt but no-one will take me seriously. even the faintest buzzing noise now makes me feel so panicked and on edge. \r\n\r\nthank you for taking the time to share my experience with me. maybe, just maybe, one day i'll find out what really did happen. \r\n\r\nyours faithfully \r\n\r\nanna sheard","distance":"20 Feet or

straight line while standing on the stairs on my front porch.  it seemed to pulsate or be \"on fire\".  it was more red than orange and circular but a bit elongated. at first i thought it was the radio tower, which is in the area but i realized with the lights movement, it was clearly not that. there was no sound.  the light seemed quite low to the ground, however my perception of depth was clouded by the darkness. i called to my family to come see it, but by the time my sister came outside the light had disappeared behind the trees. she went back inside & i remained wondering what i had just seen. i did feel that somehow it saw me.  i'm not sure why i felt this way.  i remember wishing it would come back so my sister could see it.  then it happened. i saw a second light (orb) which was the same size and color as the first.  it was moving in the same direction, from the same starting place as the first(seeming to follow the first light).  i called to my sister again, \"you have to come out here now, there's another one!\"  this time my sister made it outside in time to witness this second light before it also disappeared behind the trees.  neither of us could identify the light.  i was so relieved that she saw it.  i thought i had lost my mind.  to this day i do not know what i saw and actually want to have help eliminating all human possibilities.  i was born in mount shasta and am accustomed to strange things in the area and around the mountain, but never have i seen anything like this before.  there have been rumors that the military is testing in the area(for some years now) and i have seen strange craft in the area before, but never orbs until now.  did it hear me when i wished it to come back just before the second light appeared?  was it the same light

took consecutive pictures of this wall cloud.  after the storm passed, i looked at the pictures taken. i found after adding contrast and brightness to them, some had an unexplainable object that

continued to fly from west to east with this storm.  i have back to back pictures of this object doing this and there was only 40/100's (less than half of a second) between pictures, but the distance it covered was miles apart.\r\n\r\ni then changed my view to look toward the west (almost due west).  i started taking pictures of the wall cloud advancing from this direction.  when i looked at the

the copies of the originals are there to see as they appeared through the lens of my nikon camera.  during enhancements, i only added/reduced contrast, brightness, sharpness and cropped them to make the object appear easier to see.  i didn't alter or add to any of these pictures other than what i said i enhanced. \r\n  \r\ni have witnessed and photographed this kind of craft in the past and it always seems to be traveling with the severe weather (wall clouds to be exact).   \r\nthis is the third time in less than 3 years i have photographed these types of objects. although i can't see them when i am shooting pictures, some of the pictures i've taken, clearly indicate that something is there and is persuing these intense storms.  last year it was a dark gray/black in color and the year before, it was a light gray.  \r\n\r\nthank you for taking the time to look at this object.  i have these photos and others from the past if you would like to see them.  contact me if you would like more information on these past photos.  \r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

walking and may have missed motion at first as i was sure it was just venus). it then went up, down, to the west a bit, and then zipped off to the east with rapid acceleration moving low on the horizon and passing below venus. i lost sight of it behind the trees and buildings at that point. my wife and i then went home, missing the lighting of the river, so i can say this all happoned about

at around 8:30 pm after dark, my step father, [name removed/dr/cms] and i were driving east on 25th street toward 9th ave to a local grocery store called weingarten. midway on 25th st. between memorial blvd and 9th ave. on 25th we noticed several cars pulled over on the right side of the street headed east. several people, adults and children were standing outside their cars looking and pointing up. my step father then pulled over on the right side as well to see what was going on. and as we step out our car to my amazement was to most extraordinary thing i have ever witnessed. hovering over a neighborhood of homes on the right side of the road was this circular object with multi colored lights dancing and blinking around it! from what i can remember the lights were red, blue and green. it's hard for me to recount how high up this object was and even how large it was. maybe the size of a small car, i really cant say. i had to be between 10 and 12 years old. one thing i can say is that their were many adults out there witnessing this event and i do remember that none of them including my step father could not make logic of what this thing was. at that time even as a child i did have enough sense to know that it wasn't a helicopter! it would've been close enough to be able to hear propeller blades, plus it was not bouncing or moving!..It wasnt a blimp! we would have been able to see the balloon. and it definantly wasn't an airplane. they don't hover to my knowledge. the only thing that moving on that vehicle were the magnificent lights! after about ten or fifteen minutes of watching this ufo my step father said we had to get to the store. my only regret is not being able to see how this object moved on. we left before it did!
