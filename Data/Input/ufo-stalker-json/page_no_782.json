curtain, an open window.  3 thin beings leap over a fence, like they had springs in their shoes. all wearing white suites. a\"child\" came next to leap over the fence but fell back. i giggled because i know how to climb over the broken fence .They must have heard my thoughts as i giggled, they saw me. came in my room. don't have any idea how, as though i just blinked and one was in my room. he exrayed me from head to toe. i realized i was paralyzed as the scanning was happening. brilliant colors from the beings head area going thru my body. i saw my organs, like thru a clear glass. they heard my thoughts and i heard his. one of my ovaries was disturbing to him. when he was finished exraying me, he told me to go back to sleep. he wouldn't leave till i went back to sleep.I was frightened because when i'd open an eye to see if he'd gone, his eyes got angry. the next morning as i awoke, i ran outside to see any footprints or any sign that we had visitors. the brown leaves in the grass showed nothing. then you say, \"ah, it must of been a dream\". my aunt and uncle sat with me while we had coffee and donuts for breakfast. my cousin michael woke up and came running in the kitchen to look out the window. yelling \"did you see the clowns!? the circus!\".  i opened my eyes and mouth ready to say something, but didn't. thought it be best to talk to michael outside later on in the day. he had no recall at all.\r\nthis may have happened approximately at age 15. at age 38 i had a parcial hysterectomy. the doctor told me my left side was unusual. i could have told him that.

which is now closed, but in the middle of 3 active military operations areas: steelhead moa, pike east moa and pike west moa. it seems to follow that a large portion of what i see each night is our black projects heading up to play around over the lake. i'd expect this to be the case with ones flying on a relatively straight path, but the fact that one stopped directly overhead and accelerated at speeds that would instantly kill a pilot leads me to believe one of two things: either they aren't ours, or if they are ours, its technology we took from the et's.\r\ni realize our military has advanced technology that spawns its share of ufo reports. but, for these to be ours:\r\n1.\tthey need to generate huge points of gravity outside the craft in order for the occupant to survive the 90+ g accelerations.\r\n2.\tthe engines are beyond jets and combustion in order to avoid engine noise and exhaust trails.\r\n3.\tthey need to move through the air without contacting somehow it in order to eliminate the sonic boom\r\n4.\tif there is a pilot, for him to see the laser from any angle, the craft would need to be completely transparent to the pilot and have embedded vision enhancements.\r\n5.\tif the craft is an unmanned drone, it needs to have enough computational power to be self aware (something we won’t be close to for a long time)\r\ni give the military credit for having more speed and stealth than we are aware of, but those capabilities in a complete package, are hundreds of years away without help from et.\r\n\r\nthe full videos are about 15 gb in size, so i'm attaching a short video that contains only a few dozen samples of what i saw.\r\n\r\ni don't expect any resolution to this case. i'm presenting it mostly so the people of the world will be more aware of what's happening in the world around them on a daily basis.","distance":"501 Feet -
