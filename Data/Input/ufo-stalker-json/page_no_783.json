States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I recall it being summer 1976, sparta, wisconsin. six of us (ages 11-12) were late night fishing next to perch lake nearest to golf course. we had large sleeping bag opened up and we planned to sleep under the stars that evening. we lived nearby and back then our parents were not worried as it was the 70's, part of the culture then. my brother and one friend decided to walk home, they did not wish to campout or fish anymore. that left four of us at the site. as i looked to the stars to pass time i saw an object moving through the sky. i used a flashlight and was shinning it into the sky where i saw the object, albeit pretty high in the sky. i noticed it because it was moving rapidly, but had a low level light to it. i began flashing the light on and off into the sky when one of my remaining friends became scared and told me to stop doing it. this went on for about 3-4 minutes. i continued doing it until i no longer saw the light of the object. we then resumed what we were doing and talking, while sitting on the sleeping bag. the night was clear, weather was warm, no clouds, no wind. it was a hot night. we were situated under a large tree, probably about 30-50 feet in height. nearby there were smaller trees. as we sat there, the top portion of the tree began to blow and bend as is something were forcing it. we felt no wind sensation at all and as we looked around at nearby trees and bushes, nothing was moving, only the tree above us. all of a sudden streaks of colorful light shot across the top of the tree light being shot from a cannon. the lights were bright, many different colors. we had the tree top swaying above us while these lights streaked atop the tree. we were scared to death as we watched this for about 1-2 minutes. we could not believe what we were experiencing as there was absolutely no wind, no other trees or bushed were moving the slightest bit. we pulled our fishing lines in, grabbed poles, snacks, and everything we had. we tossed it in the center of the sleeping bag, all the time the lights continued streaking above us at the tree top level. each one of us four remaining persons grabbed a corner of the sleeping bag and ran as fast as we could. we went to the house where my brother and other friend had gone earlier. we told them what happened and we were very charged up. we eventually called the local police and an officer responded. although he seemed to believe us, he seemed to try to calm us down more than anything. i am not sure if he told us that others had seen or reported something or maybe that was just part of his efforts to calm us down. i am uncertain if there was a police report generated or if in fact the call was recorded back then, i never checked into it. we then went back to sleep on the front lawn of one of the guys houses. since this event, i have spoken to one of the other guys, years later as we were adults. he asked me if i remembered what had happened to us and i told him yes. he told me that he had never talked to anyone about it. i told him i understood. this friend died in 2005. i told my family about the incident of course after it had happened, but i had never talked about it again to the other friends that were with me that night. about a year ago, i sent the remaining two friends a face book message and asked them if they remembered the incident or wanted to talk. neither of them responded back to me. neither of them are computer savvy and really don't monitor their face book accounts at all. they both reside back in  wisconsin and i live now in arizona. my background includes 25+ years of law enforcement (police officer)  and i now work for the state of arizona as a criminal investigator. i find myself looking up into the night sky and on a few occasions, i have used a flashlight to shine into the sky. it is as if to say, i remember and/or i wish to know more about what happened to me all those years ago. almost like an invitation as strange as that sounds.

hers which was a distance of about half a block.  in her backyard, her dad kept several hunting beagles and as we talked and walked, we heard the dogs start howling.  we thought that they had cornered a cat or that someone was bothering them so we hurried to check it out.  as we approached, the dogs fell silent. seconds later, when we arrived, we looked from the sidewalk directly back to the back yard where the dogs were and saw them looking upward, which caused us to look up to see what they were looking at  and it was then we saw the object.\r\n\r\nhovering silently above a garage in her backyard was a dull silvery roughly triangular shaped object.  the triangle was longer on two sides with the corners of the triangle squared off.  the \"point\" where the two longer sides met was oriented toward the ground and there were gold/yellow lights at each of the corners.  close to the downward facing \"point\" was what appeared to be a protruding area with a red light.   even though the triangle shape was \"facing\" us, i still could tell the object had substance (wasn't flat) and that it extended back and was solid metallic.\r\n\r\nwe were transfixed and just watched it hover for several minutes before turning to each other and deciding to go get our brothers from a neighbor's house.  when we returned, the object was gone, the dogs were acting normally and our brothers thought we had made the story up!  \r\n\r\nyears later, long after [name removed/dr/cms]had moved away, i saw her at a nearby grocery store and she asked me if i remembered the time we saw the ufo.  her memory of what happened was almost exactly as i had remembered it.\r\n\r\nthe most profound part of this encounter to me was that back then, while i had heard of ufos, i had never seen pictures or

lights was when we were coming home on the activity school bus from a basketball game. red lights seemed to be following the bus. a group of girls were sitting at the back of the bus watching it. the lights did not actually move with the bus, but would appear stationary, disappear, and appear again about the same distance from the bus as it was when first seen. we thought it was curious but nothing came of it.\r\ni lived 5 miles from town in a rural setting. one night while washing dishes, i looked out the window, which was on the north side of the house and there were red lights in the sky. there were 4 and they formed a perfect geometric square. they didn't shine so much as they just glowed. i immediately recognized them as being like the one following the school bus. so i went to the living room and drug my mother into the kitchen to see them. she was unimpressed and went back to watching tv. i continued to watch them and saw that occasionally one or more would disappear and appear elsewhere always in perfect geometric shape. this happened primarily in the sky. and after this i often saw them in the same place doing the same activity. however, after a time, i observed that one would disappear and appear at the vacant house approximately 1/4 mile up the road near the highway. it did not move around the house, but would appear at a window and stay a while, disappear and appear again on the porch. then disappear and appear again with the group of lights in the sky. it seemed to me that they were checking out the house...Gathering information maybe and then sharing it. that happened often. i thought it was curious that the light so often checked out the house. i always felt a little concern when it was checking out the house because we were so close and maybe they would come to our house too. and after we went to sleep who is to say they didn't. but i never witnessed that.\r\nmy bed was also on the north side of the house and often i would go to sleep watching the lights. this went on during a two year time span. i never saw the red lights again after that.\r\ni have not been able to find anyone from that area that remembers seeing the light following the bus and my mother doesn't remember me showing them to her, (which i did more than once).\r\ni really just want to know if anyone else has ever reported something like this.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

any, not even thinking about them this was sunday night may 3rd, i was actually taking pictures and video of a very beautiful moonrise that evening over lake tillery from the fishing dock in mount morrow state park.  it was not long after sundown around 8;20 maybe. i took some photos of the moon from the parking lot with my digital camera a nikkon d5300,  \r\n\r\nthen i and my husband walked onto the fishing dock to get some better angles of the moon rising and reflecting in the lake water.\r\n\r\ni took a couple of stills first(my camera does stills and short video segments of 10 minute increments).  and when i snapped he first or second still a sudden intensely bright pin point light streaked across both my camera viewfinder moving so fast it seemed to have a streak behind it like just fast, and then gone. i also saw it in my vision regular vision as well as on the viewfinder.  i said to my husband \"did you see that\" he sort of did but suggested it was a bug streaking across across the camera.  i had switched to video by then and since it went by so fast i shrugged it off.  i have seen ufos before and this was not as spectacular as some i have seen, so this would have not even been a memory by now if i had not caught the object in one of the frames of digital shots  snapped. that was a surprise, it proved it was really there and was not some kind of strange insect.  it can be seen as a fuzzy white ball of light to the above and left of the moon in one frame. \r\n\r\nand it appeared to streak downward and vanish into the treeline and that can be seen in a second frame maybe, not sure the moon is not reflecting but have 3rd photo that was either snapped first or last in the series of 3 pics to show what area looked like before or after object streaked past.

was attending college in vermillion alberta at the time and had just arrived back and parked in the parking lot across the road from the school facing the field it was about 2am and my truck was running but i had my lights off i was rolling a smoke and was looking down at my paper and tobacco mid roll and light ahead of me caught my attention so i looked up and it took me a few moments to even comprehend what i was seeing but the best way to describe it would be these i pod shaped objects seemingly white with one side the top half had about a 5 by 5 pattern of round lights. and the rest blank but they were spinning on a vertical axis hovering across the field at a good rate of speed not much higher than ground level they were coming out of nowhere but all from the same place in the field they gave off the strangest light i've ever seen most of them were flickering in and out of transparency and all disappearing at different points throughout the field no sound whatsoever and they were no more than 500 feet from me a rough estimate in height about ten feet tall i just sat there speechless trying to think of any logical explanation to explain what i was seeing i watched for at least 5 minutes i kept thinking am i really seeing this or am i going crazy and all of a sudden from the point they were appearing there was a crazy green flare of light and my rollie still in hand went flying and i was cursing what the frick! holy crap!There's no way! i was freaking out at this point the light was probally about 50 feet  high flaring crazier than the craziest northern lights i've ever seen the light slowly moved in the same direction as the \"pods\" this went on for 5-10 seconds and then it just stopped and as that stopped it all stopped and it was normal again i just sat there for about 2 hours completely baffled  about what i had just witnessed   i'm not sure if i was unable to move or if i was just in shock definitely the craziest thing i've ever seen","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

out of it to the east. a couple minutes later i saw another white light soot out of it to the east, but slightly south. they both looked like a shooting star, but originated at the flickering star.\r\nat 02:20am, directly south, at 35°-40°, i saw a brilliant flash of blueish white light. it only lasted a second.\r\ni've seen these flickering \"stars\" before in my back yard.\r\none such star i saw every night for months. one night i noticed 5 of them spread out in the sky around hutch. they were all about the same altitude, the same brightness, and they would occasionally flicker red at different times.\r\ni never saw anything shoot out of them. i thought they were space junk or possibly a satellite.\r\nafter the other night, i now believe they are mother ships\r\nor space stations of some type that we do not know about.\r\nthese lights left the flickering star at light speed and had a trail like a shooting star behind them. they vanished\r\ndirectly after leaving the
