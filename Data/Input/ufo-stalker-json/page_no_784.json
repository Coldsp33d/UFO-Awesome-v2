craft was observed to 11:29pm when the last one was observed. the first craft came out of the east and appeared as a dim light which got brighter at certain times. i observed the first craft for approximately 5 minutes, from 10:50 till 10:55pm watching it go north but then came back around moving in a southerly direction. all of a sudden it made a maneuver of moving westward but climbing at the same time to right under the cloud ceiling hovering a bit before disappearing into the clouds. there was intense lightning happening where i observed this craft at the same time, with huge bolts coming down from the clouds . . . but also the web like lightning that flashes across the clouds too all across the sky since we were having intense thunderstorms, with rain and wind that night. i thought it was over at that time but then another light appeared almost in the same spot and did the same maneuvers as the first craft which i observed at 11:07pm but lasted less time until 11:09pm. it actually went right to the same place as the one before it did and it hovered just slightly before disappearing up into the clouds. right before the second one came into view, i observed a fluttering very bright light down at a building that is on the ground level. i thought to myself what could that be! it appeared to be some kind of flapping bright light, like a fairy type winged creature. it was way too large to be a moth and i have never seen a glowing bright bird or bat before. i have not seen anything like that under that building ever before either. i observed this creature for only 5 or maybe 10 seconds staring at 11:06pm right before my  second sighting of 11:07pm. the third sighting came at 11:15pm to 11:17 pm and the craft made the same moves coming from the same direction as the others. the fourth and last craft i saw appeared at 11:29pm to 11:32 pm came from the east but this time came towards me moving westward and up to the clouds without going north or moving around. it appeared larger than the other ones and either emitted some beam of light or was being pulled up by a beam of light. i believe it was the former of the two and not the latter. i also believe there was a mothership above the clouds because of these maneuvers but just the intensity of the lightning. i had the sensation and feeling that it was right above me. note also that i live in the flight patterns of the d/fw airport. there were airliners taking off but these planes were being directed to bank to the left getting away from the lightning storms or even maybe being directed away from the mothership itself. this is just my feeling but i had not seen airliners bank that much to the left to go north before but this is only a guess as to why. now either i saw 4 different craft or it was the same one going round and round making the same maneuver over and over. i have had so much contact now since 2010... i would say i have had way over 200 sightings many of which i reported here. the activity is ramping up and the messages i have received from them tells me that something huge is about to happen. i was told this back in 2010 but i'm being told now is the time. i need to get this out and i should be on your show or become more than an investigator for i feel they have contacted me for a reason and it is more than just to see them so i can report these things to you. they have burned a symbol in my brain which happened in 2011 and it means something. i need to talk with one of you \"experts\" and not just a field investigator. i know more than they do and time is running out! take it for what it's worth... it's about to happen and it's now","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

that day to help me through my own personal ordeals. i was never afraid of  what ever it was, the same however couldn't be said for the mother and at least one of her children who tried to call otis

and it took me a few seconds to comprehend what i had just seen, in the video i actually pause for 3 seconds before i am even able to say anything it was absolutly shocking. i looked around the sky and there was nothing there. when i went back and looked at the recording, i noticed that it did not appear to be any natural phenomenon that i am aware ofand it seems to come out of nowhere and was heading upwards.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Wings, Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

been left on. as i was walking to the shop i heard a low rumble and expected to see an aircraft approaching. instead i saw a large black triangle object i could not identify directly over head. i am a commercial pilot so i think i could identify most aircraft. this was large triangle shape object and had bright white lights at each of the 3 corners. in the center was a pulsing red/white light. no red/green indicator lights as on normal aircraft. the craft was extreme black against a star lit night. at first i thought it was about 2000 ft agl, but i can't be sure because the sound trailed the object by a short distance. as i watched the object head due north from my position i saw what looked like something descend from the vehicle at a fixed distance. i thought at that time maybe it was a military fueling aircraft and a drogue line was deployed. it had the pulsing red/white light on it. however, as it continued north from my location, that object rotated around and above the main object as it pasted over the horizon from my view.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

glanced up at the second story window.  what i could only describe as an orb of light drifted out of the window.  it wasn't necessarily bright; it didn't illuminate anything nor was it blinding by any means.  it was as though the light existed within the orb.  at first, i dismissed it as a reflection in my glasses, but i turned my head, and the orb did not move.\r\n\r\nit hovered roughly 15ft or so above the ground and a foot or two outside of the window for 20-30 seconds, i would guess, and then it moved off to my left.  it wasn't a brisk movement, just an even movement to my left. it stayed at the same height and roughly the same distance from the back of the apartments as it moved before reaching the end of the row of apartments and turning to the right around the corner.  i went through the apartment to the front door but could not locate it again.\r\n\r\nit moved independently from how i turned my head, so i know it wasn't a reflection or refraction from my glasses.  it was definitely a separate entity and was not a light shining on the glass or brick, as after it began moving, i stepped forward and could see a clear space between the orb and the back wall of the row of apartments.  \r\n\r\nits appearance wasn't a bulb of light, such as a light bulb.  it was more of a diffuse glow.  i could see the window frame behind the orb and the bricks after it moved.  as for its \"personality\", when i think back on it, i would describe it like: it was in my bedroom upstairs then came outside, not expecting to see anything.  it \"saw\" me standing there and paused for a moment to see if i was anything interesting to investigate.  having concluded that i wasn't anything interesting, it moved on to do whatever it was going to do in the first place.  it was sort of like how you would see a wild animal in the forest.  when you discover it and it discovers you, you stare at each other for a moment while it gauges whether or not you are interesting in some way or a threat.  when it concludes you are neither, it moves on to whatever it was doing.\r\n\r\ni am not saying this is what it \"thought\".  i had no communication with it, nor did i feel any kind of psychic/psychological effects from it other than the general intrigue and curiosity it inspired.  i only describe it's \"personality\" as a reflection of what it seems like it was doing.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

northeast, little over halfway up into the sky, i saw a flash of light in the sky, just out of my direct line of sight.  it was very concentrated in one location and did not illuminate the surroundings.  it also did not stay on for any length of time; it was as short as a camera flash.  \r\n\r\ni was able to note the shape of the flash.  it wasn't circular, nor was it strictly rectangular.  if you take a thin board of wood and roughly snap off pieces at both ends, you'll end up with a jagged edge on both top and bottom.  that is the closest i can think of to describing the shape.\r\n\r\nthe other way i would describe it is if you took a length of cellophane wadded it up, there would be one side of the ball that is relatively smooth.  if you turn it so that the side catches the light, it will flash momentarily right when it catches the light right.  that is what it looked like. \r\n\r\ni have never seen a known iridium flare, so i cannot say it wasn't that, but i could find no evidence of an expected flare in my area at that time.  it also definitely wasn't heat lightning. the light was too concentrated in one location.\r\n\r\ni did not witness any movement of any object in that area prior to or following the event.  however, i have seen such flashes multiple times in the recent weeks, but this was the first one i was looking at semi-directly and couldn't dismiss as being a reflection in my glasses.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":65875,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.20694876725546,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05272015-0019","longitude":-85.43944630991379,"occurred":1432454400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1432793864000,"summary":"Flash
