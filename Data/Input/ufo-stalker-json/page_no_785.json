overhead. directly in front of it (between the jet and myself) was a solid white object, hovering stationary in the east, which appeared to be changing shape slightly. it looked like it was maybe rectangular or angular and then spherical or egg shaped. initially, i thought it was a huge cluster of all-white balloons. i scanned the sky to see if perhaps there were any other stray balloons. i then saw 2 more objects of identical size and shape to the north east (left) at nearly the same altitude, perhaps about 300 - 400 feet apart from each other but about 1200-1500 feet from the first object, also hovering but moving around laterally and close together. my friend and i were fixated on them asking each other what we thought they were. after about 15 minutes of watching them, based on their coordinated movements and lack of gaining altitude, we concluded they were not balloons and clearly not helicopters, planes or drones as they produced no sound and did not exhibit the typical movements associated with those craft. the pair to the north east (left) began a synchronized, straight path movement toward the first object in the east (on right), joined the 1st object in relative distance to each other and ascended in formation together at a moderate speed.\r\n\r\ni was able to snap a few photos with my iphone 5s but the objects are very small in the frame. it was much clearer to the eye to see their shape and gauge their size. video was useless as the phone couldn't focus on them. i'd estimate the size of each of the 3 objects to be 15 - 30 feet. all were of identical size and shape, color, manner and movement. there were no appendages such as tail, wings, rotors, etc.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was having flashes of memories (my first and only memory as a baby) of an amber room with an orange light that blinded me while i was immobilized on a table and there were 3 to 5 huge, bulbous heads looking over and down on me.  i tried to cry and scream but could not.  i was adopted and nothing was known about anything like this, but they were surfacing like crazy.  i had gone to nyack to visit a friend who is heavy into spiritualism and energy and healing.  i was staying in the guest house by the pool, and at 3 am my french bulldog began acting funny, nervous, scratching at the door, so, assuming she needed to go outside i took her for a short walk. i remember thinking how nervous and hyper she was acting, and then i remember looking up at the sky and thinking i had never seen a sky look so black, almost ink like, and seen so many stars.  the air was full of some sort of electricity because my hair stood up on arms and on my neck and head.  my frenchie also had a trail of hair that stood up all down along her spine, like a scared cat would look.  i suddenly was drawn to the sky again and in the far off i saw what looked at first to be a jet plain with three lights on it, except there was no blinking of the lights.  as it approached, i saw the stars going through where the wings should have been and immediately realized i was looking at three separate objects.  they almost knew i had seen them is how i felt, like i was being watched.  i saw them turn, in unison, and veer directly for me where i stood.  at this point my frenchie began screaming and trying to crawl up my leg.  as they began to near me, i was frozen and could not stop staring.  i remember thinking \"pinch your arm!  make sure you are really seeing this!\"  as they approached the two in the rear began to fire what looked like a blue beam of electricity back and forth (communication, maybe?) as they got in line with the street i was on i began to smell sulphur, like i was in a field where a lot of fireworks had just been set off.  they seemed to be zooming straight toward us.  as they came up the hill over the street, i picked up my frenchie and began to run in total fear back to the house, trying to reach the gate to the back area where the pool was.  the street lights began going out as they passed over them, i do remember that.  the electricity in the air was so strong, the air was dry and could choke you.  my frenchie at this point was hysterical, but we made it to the gate and the lights seemed to veer up and go over us straight up and i ran into the guest house, immediately closing and locking the doors and actually sitting against the door.  for a few seconds, there was no noise of any bugs, crickets, animals, nothing.  sulphur could be smelled, lights very faintly appeared through the blinds then everything was immediately back to normal.  my frenchie also seemed to go right back to normal behavior as well, which was odd.  i had to lay down, feeling weak and exhausted.  the next day when i awoke, a panic attack gripped me.  i am not sure what they were, or what they wanted, but it was a very negative encounter.  if there is such a thing as evil, this is exactly what was coming towards me.  there was nothing good about the entire thing.  every internal alarm i had in me went off with ferocity.  my \"fight or flight\" instinct was beyond my control.  to this day, it haunts me.  i did also hear of a few other people in the area who had seen these amber orbs.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

back from bellevue, on the bridge headed back to west view, the one that passes over route 279. i looked up and to my right, maybe 15-20° or so, i saw something very strange: a square object off to the right in the general direction of the west view park shopping center and as much as several hundred feet off the ground.  it looked like it – guessing here – maybe a mile away. it was about as big as a postage stamp at arm’s length. \r\nhere is the obligatory crackpot disclaimer: i’m not one. this is my first such report and my first such experience. \r\njust so it is clear, i saw this object, whatever “it” was, saw it as plainly as i have ever seen anything in my life. my problem is that i don’t know what i unmistakably saw. this isn’t a case where something flashed by – maybe - and i wondered not only what i had seen but whether i had seen anything at all. i saw this; i saw it distinctly; i watched it for a good five minutes. it was outlined completely against the sky so it was unmistakably in the air. it was a dark green though i couldn’t make out any further detail. \r\nit wasn’t shaped like any aircraft i have ever seen (nor did it resemble any flying saucer i have ever seen in books). there were no wings or rotors or propellers or fins. it made no noise, at least that i could hear. it was a square. a big dark green square up in the air. i couldn’t even tell if it was a cube. it was like it was facing me. \r\ni thought at first that it might be some kind of promotional float at the wvpsc especially with it being a holiday weekend but it was moving and it had no writing on it (at least that i could see). (west view had its memorial day parade on monday, two days after my sighting.) it ended up drifting off directly away from me, in an easterly direction until it disappeared over the tree-line. \r\nit wasn’t a balloon. it wasn’t tear-drop shaped; there was no basket underneath it with people in it. it was much too big to be a kite. it wasn’t shaped like a blimp or anything that flies around. other people had to see it. it was just off a major thoroughfare, route 279 in the middle of a sunny weekend day.\r\nif you’re wondering, i don’t have a camera phone so i don’t have a picture of it. my hope is that someone else has already contacted you about what i saw and so you already know what it is i saw. \r\nwhile i have numerous books about ufo, i remain unconvinced of any particular viewpoint. the only thing i am certain of is that the official explanations in all the best cases are unconvincing. \r\n\r\n[witness name removed/dr/cms]\r\nwest view pa\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

shaped 3 was delta shaped. can give detailed info if some is willing to contact me. have had 4 encounters all together with that said here is some highlights .The objects was flying in formation with one delta and one disc swapping out in the formation.Flying slowly north sometimes riseing and lowering in altitude.Seemed to be almost playfull.When i first saw them they were farther away maybe a couple miles away then the drifted closer and closer yet higher and higher.One of the disc broke formation a did circles around the formation then went back in formation. at least 2 others did somewhat the same . after that i saw something aproching from the north headed to them. they were shiney that's how i spoted them the glint of the sun reflected off them as they got closer i saw it was 3 jets . they did not seem to be in  much of a hurry tho. they came from the direction of chattanooga tn. this was about 20 to 30 miles from there.I watched this for a time took a while for them to get where the ufo's were. about that time i saw 3 delta wing fighter with after burnners on coming from the direction of atlanta ga southeast of where i was.Hight altitude  but could make them out well. day was clear.When they got a few miles away  one of the other jets from the north broke formation headed  for the ufo one disc broke formation headed to that jet they passed eachother almost crashing then it veered up and followed that jet when that jet got to the other ufo's it veered off.Went up at that time 3 delta ufo seperaited from the group.And all planes and ufo broke formation and planes whent after all ufo's. the ufo's where much faster than the jets and  sometimes would chase the jets others would circle the jets. at this time the jets tried to fire on the ufo's but could not hit them.First fireing guns then firing missiles at them.Still they couldnot hit them.  then  they all when separate  directions  chaseing the ufo's getting lower and lower headed toward me and my father. they got so low that the ufos would almost touch the ground in the open ares. but jets couldnot get any lower than the trees .Lost track of most of them but two of the  disc seemed to slow down to let the jets delta wing jets get close then veering off suddenly. near the end one delta fighter fired a rocket hitting the disc in the rear causeing a peace of the disc to fall off in the hallow closest to us but was on someone else property could not go there.After that they all flew off  to the west jets still chaseing them and went out of site. this all took less than 30 min. what is interesting is that night there appeard an sphere about the size of a small car came from the west stoped directly over the site where the piece of the disc had fell.It glowed yellow orange. hovered for about 3 min  went down to the ground not touching the ground then shined a beam looked somewhat like a split lazor beam like it was scanning for the piece of the disc stayed there for a few min rose up and shot off west from where it came.It came back 2 more times each nite same time at night.Finely did not return agean.The second day after if first came  about 4 in the afternoon.Got a call from my grandmother witch lived on the same property about an 8th of a mile closer to the highway than us.And said there was some military vehickels coming up the hill wanted to talk to the owner of our property.First a jeep with a commander and a officer and 2 mp's got to us first followed by a large truck with covered bed next came a duce and a half with a officer and soldger in the cab and several soldgers in the back followed by another jeep with mp's in it. note they all had guns and rifles .The commander got out of the jeep and talked to us.He said that the where having manuvers in the area and one of the planes  lost a piece off of it and wanted to go get it said we should show him where is was and they would go get it. and orderd us to not ever say anything to anyone about what happened and even that they were there at all or quote. there have been people lost in the desert and never found\".They whent there got an object and came back  as they passed us i saw an object coverd in the truck looked like a part circle sticking up about 6 feet by 10 feet . they left and never heard from them agean. for all the details you may contact me.Can draw the ufo if needed.I fear the military no more and must tell this to some one that counts. because i have not heard of anything close to this . i have been resurching ufo's ever sence.Allso note this was in the 60's and  i have had 4 encounters thru my lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n+   ","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Patterned

the international space station or some such satellite moving into earth's shadow.  but i had only seen it for a very brief moment before it disappeared and so i was not able to detect much motion. it seemed like it was moving eastward. but it is hard to tell with such a brief observation. i do not believe there was a cloud obscuring the light. it could have been a meteor or a satellite, but i checked the position of the international space station and it was listed as being many hundreds of miles away, over the atlantic ocean between the us and europe or africa. far away, anyway, and i don't think the likely culprit. also, i get notifications from spot the station and i hadn't received notice that it was going to be passing overhead tonight. i also checked a satellite tracking site and it showed nothing overhead at the time. so, i suppose a meteor is the most likely candidate, but i wondered if anyone else saw a vanishing bright whitish point of light in the sky in the south florida area. i know it wasn't venus or jupiter as i verified their positions once i got my bearings outside. venus was well in the western sky and jupiter closer to zenith at the time.\r\n\r\nanyone

saw everyone off and as i was walking my brother to his vacation motorhome we stopped to urinate outside in the dark because it is convenient for men to do so. as we were urinating i looked up at the starry sky and commented on the clarity of the atmosphere because humidity was low. at that moment, a large slow moving craft entered our line of sight from behind my party room/man cave which had us looking east as the craft cruised ever so slowly toward the north until it left our field of vision. the craft appeared to be very large, triangular in basic shape but rounded corners and slightly elliptical (or bent) long lines, even in the stern. it emitted no light or sound and the only reason we spotted it was by starlight on the exterior surface and the silhouette that blocked out the stars behind it. as it tracked north, it slowly disappeared from our sight and as i shivered (from what? the cold night, loss of urine, that huge dark silent craft floating along?)and asked my brother what it was that we just observed. he said he didn't see a thing and to never tell anyone of our sighting because of public ridicule and loss of credibility. i was our town's fire chief at that time and my credibility was everything to me so that is why i am this long in reporting this to you. there is nothing here for you to investigate so i don't expect any response. in closing, i'd like to add

clouds and sky looked. i saw what at first looked like a black bird flying just below the clouds, but at what i estimated to be at least 2 miles high. \r\n\r\nas i watched a few seconds, i called my friend's name to see what i was seeing. i said \"that's not a bird.\"  my friend said \"it's not flapping its wings.\" we watched as it swirled around, doing a loop and flying like a bird would, but never changing its triangle shape. it reversed course to the east, changed to a circle, flew around about a short while, then took off to the north at a fast clip... way too fast for a bird. \r\n\r\nfriend thought it might be a drone. i said drones don't change shape or do loops... they fly a straight path. he admitted that it was odd.\r\n\r\nthis is my third ufo sighting. first time - smoking in parking lot at work, and saw a white tic-tac shaped object fly a straight path into the only cloud in the sky and never come out the other side. \r\n\r\nsecond time - driving on tryon st. near 485, pulled over to read written directions. looked at row of houses about 200 yds. away to see what looked like a thick, black, domino-shaped object very slowly drifting over the houses. saw longest side of object from my perspective. it was wider than the house it was floating over. behind it, i saw a plane taking off from charlotte-douglas airport. once i arrived at party, told people there, who laughed and said i must've just seen a plane. no one wants to believe, i guess, that such things exist. \r\n\r\nthanks for this site, and the opportunity to share.

it escaped view under tree cover of the neighborhood. during that 1 min time it moved from a position over i-75 from almost precisely west to east.\r\n\r\nmy first thought was that it was a chinese lantern because of the orange color, but i quickly changed my mind for 3 reasons:\r\n1) it was far too large to the naked eye to be a chinese lantern \r\n2) it was moving far too fast (e to w) to simply be carried by the wind. also its movement was constant and steady.\r\n3) it did not have smooth round edges. not only was it somewhat oblong horizontally, but along the visible edges there were \"pieces\" that appeared to be sticking out from the body of the object. i looked carefully to see if this was an effect of shimmering light, or the like. i am convinced this is not the case. this was an abnormal object.\r\n\r\ni was able to capture the object on my cellphone, about 1 minute of video. unfortunately, the camera on my phone is poor quality, and i am not a very good impromptu filmmaker. i did not utilize the zoom feature on my camera, therefore the orange object (which you can see) appears very small, when in reality to the naked eye it was not small at all. it was actually quite large looking, and appeared to be somewhat near to the ground (i estimate 300 feet but it is hard to say).\r\n\r\nafter consulting my map upon getting home i was able to ascertain the
