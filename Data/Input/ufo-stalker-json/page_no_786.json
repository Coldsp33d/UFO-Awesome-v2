at 9:45 p.M. she noticed two red-orange lights in the direction of harrisburg intl airport which is south of our location approximately 7 - 10 miles. she said the second object was west of the object described below.\r\nwhen i looked, i saw one object and she said the other object just disappeared. the object was moving slow compared to aircraft we normally see and appeared to glow a red-orange color with no flashing or other lights. the object made no sound and appeared to be maybe disc shaped with a dome top. \r\nprior to seeing this object we had observed several planes leaving and arriving the airport which are unmistakable compared to this object which was not any airplane, helicopter, space junk or shooting star.\r\nthe object was heading almost directly north in a straight line towards us. we have two large oak trees out front of our house and when the remaining object was lower on the horizon we could clearly see it without any obstruction from the tree. once the object got closer to us it was partly obscured by the tree. i had told my wife to go in and get the camera so when it came over the tree we could try and get a photo. while she was in getting the camera i saw the light from the object through the leaves on the tree and by the time my wife came out with the camera it was gone. i never took my eyes off the object and never saw where it went. \r\nwe got off the porch and walked all around looking for any sign of it and never saw it again. to us this was clearly a ufo.\r\nthis is our second ufo sighting and it is quite awesome. our previous sighting was about 7 years ago at [location removed/dr/cms]\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line

however, two other brilliant diamond white lights appeared and all four objects stopped dead in their flight path above our zenith. i based their size to be between the head of pin or possibly half an aspirin size. so the objects were very high in the sky/atmosphere. as i recall they stayed motionless for about a minute maybe more; when suddenly all four objects streaked out of sight in what appeared to be the four cardinal directions. i therefore reasoned these four object were not of earth, because nothing i was aware of could fly/move that quickly and through space!\r\n\r\nwhat is of significance for me then as now still, was how they just shot away from their overhead positions. as each object streaked in their own ordinate directions,their light trails stayed illuminated until the light winked out (dissipated).\r\n\r\nthe closest analogy i can describe, would be to equate a metal object moving like an earring on a tv studio persons ear during the period when tv cameras were going digital; i think sometime in the late 70's thru the 80's. when someone moved in their physical direction and reached a new position it took several thousandths of a second before the streak of light caught up with them as they came to a new stationary position. no other analogy fit for me until this or like in startreck, when, as the enterprise hyper jumped it left a dissipating light trail behind until all light source ended.\r\n\r\nto state the obvious we were astounded and this memory has stayed indelled within my memory me for over forty years.\r\n\r\ni must state for the record, once after returning from the service sometime between 1970 or 1971, i met again with my best friend [name removed/dr/cms] (now deceased) and asked him if he recalled our incident. he told me he did not recall any such thing. this puzzled me for years. then i remembered, he was a private pilot. and i assume he did not want to remember because it might jeopardize his pilots license. the only other person who might be able to corroborate this event would be[name removed/dr/cms]. the other two or three neighbor boys were [names removed\\dr\\cms]. sorry, i do not recall their last names. \r\n\r\nas a further aside, i once had an opportunity to relate this experience to dr. hynick (sp) of project blue book, while attending california state university chico, sometime between 1972 or 1973. he gave a presentation on ufo encounters from project bb. i told of our childhood encounter and my impression was he was non-plused and blew my event description off; turning to some other student and began talking with them. pissed me off to say the least!\r\n\r\nsince then i have rarely recounted this event to others for the obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nin closing i do not know if this is of any value to mufon, but since it happened, i felt i would at least offer this event experience.\r\n\r\nif you would like to speak with me feel free to call me here in [location and phone number removed/dr/cms]. hopefully others reported this event in the past too.

my mind was boggled all day and weeks and months to come. i hope others have seen what i have, because it has haunted me for years. i  still go to work at midnight and gaze into the skies before i get into my truck and go to work hoping to see one more craft zooming through sky just to say to myself \" i'm no crazy after all\" , they do exists!  i just needed to get this off my chest after 19 years. thank you for listening.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":65828,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.9492174,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05252015-0017","longitude":-117.1998655,"occurred":839329800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1432601415000,"summary":"Long cigar shaped. green fluorescent fuzzy like. traveling over 60 miles in 2 seconds. no sound.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"92551","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6866,"locationName":"Moreno Valley, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:33588"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Ayia Napa","country":"Cyprus","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Myself and my friend was at mcdonald's in ayia napa, cyprus for some lunch. when we finished and went back outside, we sat on our quads. i then looked up into the sky and saw this object. i then pointed it out to my friend who also looked up and saw this object. as i was pointing it out to him, some other random people looked up also, and they noticed it to. i didn't have a clue what the object was as i saw this robotic arm extending out, then retracting, then repeating this process numerous times. the object was completely stationary with no side movement or up and down movement. the only movement was from the arm. there was no lights coming from the object and there was no sound what so ever?

.4 mile residential street walk to my building when i first noticed two objects about 1/3 along my way. between two major streets, it becomes very peaceful and quiet. beautiful, mostly clear night, taking in the stars. looked left (east) and saw two orange red glowing spots above the trees and roof-lines. \r\n\r\nthe objects were in a steady glide and kept spatially relative to each other. there were no other familiar, identifying lights and they caused sound nor emitted any vibrations.  \r\n\r\ni stopped to watch them and noticed they left no streaks behind them in transit and were not \"shooting\" at a fast rate of speed as a shooting star or meteor would.\r\n\r\nas they glided above, they dimmed at first and the left one blinked out, the remaining one dimmed a bit more then disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\ni scanned the sky around the area they had been but could see no indication of their presence. i scanned then in the direction they seemed headed and again saw them further to my right (westerly). they were again noticeably bright. as i observed, they were now on a more north westerly tack. once again, they dimmed, as before, one blinked out but the other remained dimly glowing for a short time and them disappeared.\r\n\r\ni scanned the skies for a few moments and saw nothing else so i continued my walk, still checking the sky.\r\n\r\nthinking the experience was over, and perhaps 150' to 200' further along, again out of the eastern sky, two more objects of the same description appeared above the trees and roofs. these also glided steadily and in a spatial relationship with each other and made no sound or vibrations. i stopped to watch.\r\n\r\ndirectionally, the path of these two was different, heading on a wsw tack. again they dimmed and one after the other, they blinked out. at this point in my walk, i was close to my destination and there is a lot more light pollution in the area.  i could not spot any further indication of them.\r\n\r\nwe get to observe annual meteor showers in this area and i have seen shooting stars, some close to the ground. i know what those look like. these were none of

initially thought it was flaming debris from someones firecracker, as there is a large field of bushland meters away. however, it appeared to move n-ne in a starlight line, defying cross winds. as it descended slowly towards us, getting bigger and brighter, we could distinctively see the colours of its flames, beating just like a candle and bright yellow. you could begin to hear cracking and popping noises, just as if you were next to a camp fire. it appeared to be right above us just hovering in one place, in what seemed to be minutes passing by. the fireball then started to move in an upward angle, we could feel the heat emanating from it as it began to ascend in a s-sw line. it faded slowly, not like it was going out, but as if it was moving farther away giving a soft orange-red glow, before disappearing from sight. \r\n\r\ni decided to report the incident to the bureau of meteorolgy and the local observatory, and their responses were almost identical. stating that there was

there was not enough light to find the orbs in the view finder. orbs moved from west to east and were visable for approximately two minutes. i quickly ran inside to get my daughter to be witness. by the time we arrived outside again, two of the orbs had vanished. the last orb was visible for around thirty seconds, then faded out while moving to the east. orbs looked to be far away to the north. orbs stayed at approximately 25-30 degrees above the horizon.
