then the third picture shows six lights (all of them being the same color and having the same motions. the fourth picture shows only four, the others had vanished as well. the fifth picture is blurry and you could see the moon being the brightist light with a planet/star about 45 degrees to the moons north east. a blurry spot to the top left of this picture was a dust particle on my camera (iphone 5s) and below that are 3/4 ufos. the sixth picture i find most interesting as you can see the moon and the planet again to the right half of the picture and on the left you'll see five objects (one even larger or perhaps closer to the earths surface than the others. this larger object appears (when zoomed in on) to have its own two lights to its left side! in the seventh and eighth pictures i tried to zoom with my camera to take these pictures while focusing on one object (the only one that was there in the sky at this moment). the sky was extremely clear. the sun had jus set if not completely set. none of the objects appeared to fly over me even though they were heading north. in this instance i took my son and walked south towards where the objects were appearing to follow them. i had a thought that they might be chinese lanterns but they appeared to be very large ( maybe the size of an average car) but all of them had switched directions as i noticed there was no wind or sound or even a rumbling!  no other persons in my vacinity had looked up at these objects and i was tempted to ask random people if they saw what me and my son were seeing. as we walked south to 112th street, still on madison ave, i noticed that one had switched direction and heading due west. as we walked slowly following the objects, i took pictures nine and ten which have three lights in each that formed nearly a perfect triangle but each picture varied in the direction that each triangle was pointing. i crossed madison avenue, nearing 112th street, when i snapped the final picture (eleven not able to include due to the site) and saw the object going west and then we lost sight of it as if it had completely vanished! i have no idea what these may be but i used the process of illumination as i watched them; they're not helicopters, definitely not planes and they can't be balloons because they produced their own lights and had controlled direction. this isn't my first personal experience with potential ufos. a couple years ago, i'm not sure when but it was around the same time of year but at about 12:30 am, i had crossed madison ave at 115th street. there were no cars as i looked southward down madison avenue. the sky was clear and very dark, a slight breeze, i looked directly above the south horizon and saw a light. it was whitish with a slight blue color to it. i stopped when i crossed madison and stared at it. it slowly moved directly north for about 15 seconds and then as it approached almost directly above me, it shifted east and disappeared over one of the buildings. i got to snap a picture of it and i believe i may still have it on my old ce phone. but this experience yesterday was a major surprise for me.

glowing orange.Almost like steel heated in a blast furnace.The craft hovered at it's original altitude over the road,i could not take my eyes off of it.In that brief moment i actually felt uncertainty

i don't think we were scared but just very curious at the time.  \r\n\r\ni really cant remember what happened next as far as what happened to the object. if it started to ascend into the air or i don't remember seeing it ascend.  \r\n\r\ni remember my sister in law telling me to get in the car we were going to follow it.. so it must have started to move from where we had seen it hover.  \r\n\r\nas we were driving down the street. we could see it in the sky, so it was no longer in the location we saw it in. it was still pretty low in the sky though.  as we were driving down the street, we had seen a few people..Like someone on their bike who stopped to look at it and a couple of walkers.  we pulled the car over and rolled down our window and my sister in law said to them, are you seeing what we are seeing?  they said yes.  she had asked them if they knew what it was, they said no idea. \r\n\r\nfrom woodland st we had gone on chamberlain hwy, still following the craft but at this point could see it had gone much higher in the sky.  we had gotten onto 691 heading towards southington.  while on the highway, tall rocks, had obstructed my view and when we had reached an area of highway where the rocks didn't obstruct my view, i didn't see it anymore.  unsure whether it went too high in the sky, turned a different direction or just disappeared.  but last seen high near the cliffs at hubbard park, along 691 highway. \r\n\r\nthere was at least 5 witnesses out on the street of woodland st that night that we had stopped the car along the way to talk to.  from the size of this, there had to be many more that saw it. \r\n\r\njust curious if anyone else had reported something similar around this time. \r\n\r\nmy sister in law is no longer married to my brother. throughout the years, i have seen her infrequently but when i do, she brings up this story...Remember when we saw something?

finished it due to a couple of reasons, one, my family are christians and don't believe in that and did not want to make to big a a deal about it, two, i got very sick and about died from that and took about two years to fully recover, and three, i moved, and four i first called the national ufo reporting center and that was a bad experience because he treated me like i was an idiot. the night of the sighting i took detailed notes and after my move i found all them notes. i'm not looking for anything i would just like to make sure you have my picture i took at close range and want you to have it on record for posterity . i had already believed in ufos due to the fact that mathematically its impossible for humans to be the only life in the universe   with that said its also not something i thought i would see right in front of me. it was oct 19th about 7:25 pm when i saw a  very bright object coming from space in a 45 degree angle moving very very fast, i thought that extremely strange cause meteors tend to ark and move slower then this was, when i realized that the impact was going to be very close to where i was i got very nervous and got ready for impact  when i saw it was about to hit the ground it completely leveled off with the ground without slowing down. it was on my side to the mountain and then came to a stop.. it began to move around and stopping then moving for a while until it got close to me. in front of my house there is a road and when it crossed the road it was just about 50 or so feet in front of me, thats when i saw the details of the craft.. it was orange to red in color  but the craft it self was a dull flat black. when i turned my camera on of my phone i took a pic but it had stated to move so it made it look like it was in motion, but you can still see the structure of the craft. it moved around for quite a while, then it went up to at least 5 to ten thousand feet when i realized there were f16's coming full after burners, thats when i noticed it went up to a much bigger object that was not as well lite and i seen smaller objects moving around it, the jets tried to reach their altitude but they moved higher, then speed out of sight at what seemed to be many thousands of miles an hour and with the jets moving at mock 2 looked as if the jets were standing still.  the thing i do find interesting is that minutes later other jets came to the mountain range and dropped a series of flares almost as if to already to make a cover story if people were to report this they could then say it was them dropping flares.. this is a very small town and not many people so i'm not sure if anyone else seen or reported this.. i just thought this was to important and wanted you to have record of it and my pic.

chest. a few nights after my dad died, one of my friends and i were sitting on my front porch talking. i noticed through the trees, in the sky, out by the road, something pulsing different colors. it was hovering in one spot. i pointed it out to my friend. then we ran out to the road to see what it was. right about the time we got to the road it stopped pulsing and changed to only having two bigger bright white lights with a smaller one below them. as we watched it, it moved slowly left and right making no noise. it was also getting closer so obviously we started to get nervous. just as a car was coming down the road it moved out of sight because of the trees. it was the only time before or since that i seen it. one of my other friends in the neighborhood said he had seen the three white lights before when i told him the story. the one thing that makes it interesting to me is that we lived about 10 miles from a national guard army base. they have acres of land. more than enough room to test secret or extra terrestrial craft.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

(speedway now not in existence) this speedway was just west of the amarillo international airport.  while we were watching the races suddenly the power went out. there were no lights and all of us spectators were sitting in the dark and the races ceased.  we heard someone from the announcers box speak out from their window (no microphone of course) that the transformers had failed and that the power company was called out to restore power.  \r\nas we all sat there in the spectators stands someone said \"what is that up there?\" i looked up behind us and saw a very large craft in the night sky.  i remember that it was a dark object and hard to tell what the exact shape was.  however, i did see brilliant white lights on the outside parts of the craft, with some of the lights seemingly moving separately from the main craft but still in unison yet unattached somehow.  by my estimation i think the craft was about 1/4 to 3/8 of a mile long and about 200-300 feet wide.  as the craft moved off to the north i saw a very large teardrop shaped dome underneath and in the front of the craft and it had large dull green, red, yellow-orange lights that were separated from each other.  kind of like a type of christmas ornament.  the craft was totally silent.  it moved off slowly in level flight and seemed to me that the craft was observing the crowded spectator stands of human beings.  that is my opinion.
