door, right beside my younger sister in a full size bed. i am guessing it was after midnight, i never knew what time it was or the exact date.\r\ni was woken up some how, and looked to my left. beside my bed stood 2 men about 3 to 4ft tall. they were side by side and the one furtherest away from me was passing his hands over my abdomen and thigh area not physically touching me. i felt nothing if he did. i was never so terrified in my life. i started frantically moving my eyes around the room, trying to figure out what was happening. i immediately noticed one at the foot of my bed with his back to me looking forward towards a window directly in front of the bed, and he was not moving. i then noticed to my far right, one standing in front of my chest of drawers, picking up and looking at my belongings  and i could hear him putting them back down. a hair brush, mirror and perfume and a few other trinkets. not sure what else was on there. \r\ni then looked back at the two beside me, the one closes to me never moved, he was just staring straight down at my stomach area. \r\ni then looked to my far left and noticed one of them, standing at the doorway, it was like he was a look out. he was standing with his arms folded and his legs crossed. he only looked straight ahead into the hallway. \r\nthey all 5 looked identical. dark silver grey color, with hats on. like a fedora hat, all the same color as their skin. no clothes. i could only see human like features of little men. \r\nonly my eyes could move. my body was completely paralyzed. i was shaking and sweating, i could feel the sweat literally pouring off my body in fear. i tried with everything i had to touch my sister, one finger away. but i couldn't even move my finger. \r\nthe man that had his hands over my body was the leader. he told me, \"it's ok, it's ok\"\r\nthis was done telepathically. i did not understand at 12 years old how that happened. i was so shocked i heard him tell me this, in my mind. it seemed like seconds later i was asleep. \r\nwhen i woke up in the morning, it was bright and sunny outside. i don't know how much time or what time it was when i woke up. i ran down stairs as fast as i could to tell my mom what had happened to me. i told her exactly this experience. she tried to convince me that it was all a dream. i assured her i was wide awake, and fully aware of what was happening. \r\nthis experience has haunted me for 40 years. i have never told this to anyone outside of my family.\r\ni have had alot of medical problems lately and am now disabled. i never slept all night since then. i now take zquil and wear ear plugs at night, just so i can sleep.\r\ni have also had paranormal experiences most of my adult life. i don't know if they ever come back at night. i can't let my mind go there. \r\ni don't know if this has anything to do with my experiences, but i am rh negative. no one else in my family is. \r\nthank you~ i am relieved and terrified for telling this all at the same time.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":65775,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.81648583193232,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05232015-0031","longitude":-81.38016533189739,"occurred":179391600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

heading home to oakdale. about 6:25 pm. it was dark, lightly raining, maraposa is a 2 lane country road. i was a mile past the gas station all fields and orchards. no other cars as i could see several miles ahead of me, but i observed what i thought to be a large, maybe 747 plane commonig in my direction about 2 miles ahead. my first thought was it had to be an antique plane, flying to stockton for a show or something, there is no commercial flight path for miles where i am. as it approached me, it stopped above me and to my left. i stopped my car, turned off radio and rolled down my window and got out of my car, looking up. there was total quiet, but for my car. i observed about 8 lights spaced in the shape of a giant wing, i could see no outlines or anything, just lights, the lights left no reflection on the object they were attached to but i got the visusl impression that something was \r\nsolid, almost as if cloaked,, like my eyes knew there was a solid mass inbetween the lights but yet couldn't see anything. and the odd silence as it hoovered, for about a minute, then the sound of jet engines from nowhere, and it moved and continued its flight towards stockton. i got back in my car, whatever it was, it saw me, because my car lights were the only light in the dark evening as it hovered above me, there are no street lights, just country road. i drove back to the station and told the attendant about it, i stated i wasn't saying it was a ufo. but had they 3 men there, ever seen such. one man emphatically stated it was a drone, i told him it was too big to br unmanned.\r\n  i then went home and researched on the internet a company that was advertising their stealth planes on t.V., northrupt grummond, they show all their drones and other planes they produce, but none of them could have been what i had seen, untill the last plane they show is the ridht size a large wing, but it is under a tarp! you can only see the shape. big secret? we have technology that can silently hover but the jet engines kick in when it moves?\r\nwe are always being told that the technology we know of is actually, far behind what we are capible of! i stick by my observation, i did see and hear, a cloaked, or visually hidden wing shaped obje t that did hoover silently. and by wing i am not talking about the triangular shaped planes we have like the blackhawlk?, it was shape long and narrow like you removed the body and engines of a huge jet and stuck them together. no cockpit body, no typical engines either. \r\n\r\n ","distance":"101-500

exit (in illinois). i waved over a neighbor of mine in the parking lot, and asked him if he saw it too...He did. we then scanned the sky and saw three lights in the distance behind our building and one more to the east of the object that had a red light flashing. none of these moved either. the one we were watching was the closest to us. it was east of the moon on a clear night. it's altitude was higher than a small aircraft (lots of small aircraft fly) but it was much lower than a commercial airplane. i took lots of pictures. during this time frame, about 8 or 9 other people in the condo complex watched it also. since then, this object has been in the sky near my condo on a regular basis. it even has followed me to work in nearby hinsdale, and followed me back home. the pictures attached were taken when i spent a weekend in madison, wisconsin march 27, 2015. the other set was taken at my condo building april 23,2015. it continues to appear in different locations nearby

it was strange, because i saw it's lights, saw it's outline, but seeing the stars was like looking through water. they seemed to \"bounce\" a bit as i watched them. i could see the shape of the object as it moved, but at the same time not see the shape of the object. the one thing that was very obvious was the row of lights moving across the sky. the object moved at a steady, not fast, pace to the nw. then it was gone. i did not see it change direction, it was just not there, or simply no longer visible. as it moved past me, it just vanished. this whole occurrence lasted maybe a minute. \r\ni was in awe. i couldn't believe what i just saw and that it was so obvious what i just saw. i got goose bumps. i ran inside and called my son, because i knew he would believe me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":65763,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.94218997539537,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05232015-0020","longitude":-91.37418176915757,"occurred":1426648500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1432393527000,"summary":"I could not believe what i was seeing.  i thought,","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"62301","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":66,"locationName":"Quincy, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:34190"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"San Marcos","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Helping a friend with car problems on the access road off ih35\r\nlooking up at the clouds checking for possible rain and above the clouds i observed a round dull gray object shoot straight across the sky . it had no wings , no propellers and no sound ..This was my second sighting in less than a month the other was at canyon lake at an outdoor concert at this sighting myself and others observed an orange ball move across the night sky it made a dead stop and just disappeared  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":65762,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.8919849,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05232015-0019","longitude":-97.9390241,"occurred":1431820800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1432389505000,"summary":"Staring up at clouds saw something fly overhead","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"San Marcos, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:34191"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Bloomfield Hills","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was about 10 or 11 years old when i was with a friend in my backyard shooting at each other with air soft guns. my friend and i were about 50 yards from each other parallel to the rivers water line. we were roughly 30ft from the edge of the water. i was completely obsorbed into what i was doing at the time which was staying quiet and staying low while i listened for my friend to make any noise to give away his position. it was around 4 o'clock in the afternoon because we had left school not much earlier. as i was sitting there quietly waiting i heard some sticks crack and something move to the right of me. looking anxiously for my friend to be creeping around for me i didn't see anything right away except for some brush and small branches from trees moving in a specific spot. at the time there was no wind and it was braud daylight. i saw a branch snap backward like it was caught on someone's clothing or extremities and that's when i saw it. standing at around 8ft tall with an oval shaped head and what seemed to be joint that were backwards from human joints was a being that was completely translucent. it was difficult to make out at first but once i spotted it i could see everything. i was younger at the time and absolutely terrified and yelled out at it \"freeze\"! pointing the air soft gun at the creature hoping i could make sure it didn't want to harm me or come near mer it turned from its path into the heavily wooded area it turned and stared directly at me in a bent kneed attack stance. at this point i was in complete shock and i think it knew that as much as i did and we continued to stare at each other. it made a series of several weird noises that i could not describe through text and made a couple of glances to its right at the heavily wooded tree line. it quickly returned to its original path and made a few quick strides toward the woods. still stunned i watched it maneuver past a couple branches ducking and dodging its way through still able to visibly see it's clear holographic figure and then it completely dissapeared not because it was to deep into the woods but it must have been able to control how visible it was some way. even though it was completely invisible at this point i could still see trees and branches moving and being rustled with as it made its way farther and farther until it was gone. i ran as fast as i could screaming in terror into my house explaining to my mom what i had saw with my friend fallowing not to far behind. still to this day the kid i was with completely backs the encounter and my mother remember how frantic and terrified i was. the very scary fact of all of it is that after the incident took place i had no recollection of what happened after running inside my home at that time and still to this day. i never saw it again but did hear many many strange noises coming from outside often and another occurrence took place a couple years later where i witnessed a large black triangle ufo with three orange/red lights at each corner flying about 200ft above my house. it very slowly spinned while hovering with no noise above my home for about 3 to 4 minutes while my brother my friend and i watched and it then took off in an instant straight up at angle until all you could see was what appeared to be a star flicker out into blackness. scary s***! if you have any information on the translucent being that i encountered please share your information because i still am absolutely infatuated with what it was i saw that day.

was dark around 8:40 maybe 9 o'clock at night. but as i was walking across the street before i got half way this bright white light appeared over the street light like maybe 5 to 10ft over the street lights and i first thought it was a helicopter looking for someone so i took off my headphones and i was expecting to hear a lot of noise or something but i heard nothing.. that got my attention i was very curious to what was flying so close to the street. but as i got curious it stopped and by this time i was across the street almost to the bus stop which had other people there but they seemed not to notice this object in the sky maybe because it made no noise. so as i was looking at it it was like the white light disappeared and now this gold orange color started going around the object it was like one by one it went around the ufo and i saw its black windows i saw something there beside the sky. the gold orange color went around the object hitting one window at a time and i got scared so i called my mom and explain to her wat was going on and it stayed there for like 5 mins maybe more doing the same thing it was like it was watching me and it knew i saw or was seeing it there no one else would look or anything i felt like it was looking at me. so i stayed on the phone tilly bus came which was like a 20 to 30min wait. and the aircraft or object was there for a long time doing its things. than all of sudden it was gone i looked around for it and saw it traveling west which it went all the way down and towards that way is luke air forced based. i watched it go all the way down there and than the object appear to brighten up the whole aircraft now was that gold orange color and i could see the lines in it from the windows and it was just hoovering and flying slowing in one spot down there i thought to myself how can i still see this things this is not something that is from here or that i had ever seen felt or experience. than the bus came so i left and got off the phone with my mama. when i got off the bus i ran home which was like a 5 to 10 minutes run i was frighten i was going to be abducted i felt like it knew i was watching it and it was watching me. i would say this object was the size of a two story house and it was so low tree height barely above the streetlights. and it made no noise and i could see its material it shape and i will never forget this day which was september 19 around 8:30 9 o'clock 2009 i was 17 years old and would never ever forget what took place and how i felt and what occurred was phenomenal and  extraterrestrial. what i

decade ago. they said at the time that it was the first report they had fielded. a summary is still listed on their site, but whoever wrote it seems to have misunderstood some things. also, it says the report is on file with mufon, but i can't find it on the website here, and no one has ever contacted me to let me know if they had discovered what it was. this is what happened on the nights of tuesday and wednesday january 16-17, 1990 (it was after midnight early in the am) and tuesday, january 30 (31st?), 1990 around midnight. i had been working late that night. i stopped at the apartment my boyfriend shared with some friends before heading home around 12:30 am. i was 19 at the time, but it should be noted that neither myself nor anyone i visited that night was a drinker or drug user. i've never done either. i took st. joe rd. northeast out of town. it was a warm, foggy night with a very low cloud ceiling. no other cars were in the vicinity as i turned onto the \"angling road\" as we always called it (really the end of antwerp on the west side of schwarz). i hadn't seen anything in the sky before i turned, but of course, i wasn't looking. in 1990, there was nothing on that short stretch of road but scrub forest on the left and farmland on the right. about half of the way to schwarz, i was startled by an unknown flying craft that passed directly over my car, mirroring my path exactly. it overtook my car and continued forward at a steady clip. in my life, i've often looked up at night, seen lights and thought, \"is that a plane?\" on this night, i took one look and the blood quite literally ran out of my face. i instinctively hit the breaks and rolled my window down, but i was in a daze for a few moments watching it. i also apparently turned the sound on my car radio all the way off without actually turning the radio off. i didn't discover that until several days later. i don't recall hearing any noise of any kind from the craft. i couldn't determine the actual outline of it, but it had one red light in the center that flashed -- not in a garish way, more of a soft pulsing on and off. it appeared much larger than the white lights (6 to 8) encircling it. the white lights did not flash. it's difficult for me to estimate the size of it. the best comparison i can make is that it looked roughly the size of a full moon high in the sky. when it had passed the intersection with schwarz, it seemed to me that it was turning very casually to the right. it kept turning and turning until suddenly i realized that if it kept it up, it could conceivably come back in my direction. without even realizing it, i had all but stopped in the center of the road. that thought shook me from my daze. when i sped up again, and when i came to the intersection, instead of continuing on antwerp as intended towards my parents' house, i did the thing i thought it would least expect. i made a sharp left onto schwartz, driving as fast as was legal north all the way to leo road/state road 1 where i turned left (west), entered leo, and turned left again(south) . i never once looked back. i was fortunate enough to meet up with a semi heading for fort wayne, and i hugged its bumper all the way through cedarville and then west on to the intersection of dupont and tonkel/clinton. my only thought was to get back to the city where there were more people, so i followed the semi southwest on clinton towards fort wayne. by the time i reached the intersection with washington center rd. it was probably a good 20 minutes after the initial sighting, and i was beginning to feel silly. it was late. i just wanted to go home. i turned left, traveling east on st. joe center. rd, then proceeded to get into the left turn lane to go back northeast on st. joe road (again). this was when what appeared to be the exact same craft passed directly over my car a second time. once again it was mirroring my path (and the roadway) perfectly. i was just coming to a stop at the intersection when i saw it. after overtaking me, it continued forward at the same casual pace, tilting slightly as it changed its trajectory towards new haven. i could see wisps of clouds passing underneath it, but the actual shape still wasn't obvious to me. there was at least one other car at the intersection at that moment -- a man heading south into fort wayne on st. joe rd. he was stopped at the light too, and when i saw him, he was leaning forward in his seat, craning his neck to watch the craft as it flew away, so that confirmed to me that this was something out of the ordinary and not just my overactive imagination. just then, a light rain began to fall. i was in a virtual panic at this point even though the craft had continued on, showing no sign of turning back. i decided on the spot not to go home and turned right (south) across two lanes, winding up on the wrong side of a divided road in the process. thank goodness i didn't encounter any cars before i found a crossover. i then turned into the parking lot for the shops and bars just north of canterbury green apartments and sat in my car for at least 15 minutes. people were constantly coming and going even at that hour because of the bars, so it seemed like the perfect place to hide. i was still too scared to go home, so i went back to my boyfriend's apartment (waking everyone up) and told him all about what had happened. he and his friends were very knowledgeable about the military and various kinds of aircraft, so i thought they might know what it was. they did not. i convinced them to let me stay the night there, and i went home the next morning. my parents were understandably very upset about that the next day, but i couldn't tell them the truth about why i didn't come home. i actually expected to see something in the newspaper about it a day or two later, but it was never mentioned. for the next two weeks, i was still very anxious about it, and i didn't like driving after dark. i would often turn my car lights out after crossing schwartz rd in an effort to avoid attracting attention (so long as there was no traffic). i also felt very nervous at bedtime, but i was always able to fall asleep okay. that changed exactly two weeks after the initial sighting. i was at home and had headed to bed around 11:30 pm (?) on tuesday, january 30, 1990. this time, no matter how much i tossed and turned, the anxiety would not allow me to fall asleep. i'm not sure how long i tried, but i think i gave up sometime just before midnight. once again, i had reached the point where i felt i was being ridiculous. i wanted to take my life back once and for all. i got up and marched over to my bedroom window, certain that i would see absolutely nothing there. it was a clear night, much colder than two weeks prior. at first, i didn't see anything. i stood there for a few seconds longer, but before i could laugh and heave a sigh of relief, what appeared to be the same craft appeared in the sky over the tree line, heading at a casual but steady clip west(left to right from my perspective). it was beyond my parents' property, but it was difficult to tell how far. i felt all but positive it was the same craft even though i was seeing it from an angle. i would say it was roughly at the same altitude as well, though it was difficult to judge. that was bad enough, but a moment later, another light caught my eye -- a large single red light which did not flash traveling east (right to left). it seemed to me at the time that they were headed directly for one another. perhaps it was just paranoia, but i was suddenly hit with the feeling that they somehow knew i was watching them. i really didn't want to wait around to see what happened if they met. i closed the curtains, got back in bed, pulled the covers around me, and thought with all my heart, \"just go away,\" over and over again. but you know what they say... \"be careful what you wish for\". i haven't seen anything like it since. i thought i could just show people my diagram, tell them what had happened, and eventually someone would say, \"oh yeah! i know what that is. it's __________.\" instead, i find that people clam up when i try to have an intelligent conversation about it, so i've more or less given up on that approach. i'm not making any claims about what i saw, but i'm absolutely positive of the details. i made a point to burn them into my memory so that i could accurately describe what i saw for the rest of my life if needs be. i'm well aware that many of those details are less exotic than the ones which surround traditional unidentified flying object sightings. i just want to know what it was once and for all. after my initial fear faded, i made the decision that if i ever saw it or anything else i couldn't identify again, i would not draw those curtains. if i saw it from my car, i would try to follow it as far as i could. i find the \"not knowing\" part to be far worse than anything that could possibly happen to me. and of course, i would take pictures since we all have cell phone cameras now.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,
