friend, and i noticed a low aircraft.  it was coming toward us from the east with a very low altitude and very slow speed. it was dusk and the sun was already down and we were in the last half hour of light.  the ship was difficult to see because it was kind of transparent like the military planes that have the camouflaging skin that can mirror the sky. as it came closer i could see that it was triangular in shape, almost like a stealth fighter, except that it was flying backwards.  what i mean by that is that the point was in the back and the flat side was on the leading edge.  the leading edge had 5 white lights on the face of the flat side. it had to be under 500ft in altitude, completely silent and very large. i've been to the dayton air show and i would venture to say that this craft was every bit as large as a b-52.  it passed directly over us and i mentioned something about that it had to be flying illegally low. that led to my neighbor raising his arm and middle finger and saying \"yeah he is. f@$* you\".  the craft continued on its westerly path at a slow pace of roughly 10mph. with the low light of the day and transparency of the craft it disappeared not far off in distance.  we all thought that it was a very odd shaped plane and amazing that it made absolutely no sound.  i found it strange that it didn't have the typical green and red marker lights on the left and right as most planes do.  we live less than an hour from wright patterson air force base and resolved that it must be some new high tec military plane.  while we were discussing this all of a sudden we noticed that the ship was back. this time much lower, i would guess somewhere around 100ft above us.  this time the lights on the front were much brighter and illuminating us much like if a car turned on its high beams. we started joking that my neighbor just got put on the fbis watch list for flipping them the bird on the first pass, that they obviously saw.  i've always been under the impression that it was a military plane but in the last 10 years i've never found an aircraft to match what i saw. i have found photos/illustrations of ufo's that look like what i've seen, except that they always have them flying with the point in front and not the flat side like i saw. its been in my thoughts ever since about exactly what it was. if you could shed some light on this ship for me that would be great. thanks","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

built and we had just moved into a short time earlier. i don't remember the time of year but it was dark out and not cold but i don't remember it being hot either.  i don't remember who saw it first, but all 4 of us saw an orange, cigar shaped object. it was flying about tree top high but was probably several miles from where we were. it made a low humming noise. my parents, aunt & uncle were inside playing cards. the window was open and we were begging them to come outside and look but they did not. while we were watching the ufo move from west to east, we began to hear military type helicopters coming from the northwest and they flew directly over our heads. i don't remember if i actually saw the helicopters or counted them, but there were several. they were all headed toward the object and the ufo and helicopters went out of our line of sight. i knew these were military helicopters by the sound, they were very loud like the type with two rotators on them. that type and regular helicopters passed overhead often and i always believed they were traveling between the us air force base in little rock, ar and the base that was then located outside blytheville, ar, that is now closed.\r\ni was about 11 years old when this happened, i am now 51 years old. several years ago my family and i went to visit my aunt, uncle and cousins who now live several hours away. i asked each of my cousins separately if they remembered it and they did. they did not hesitate at all so i know that what we saw was a very vivid memory for us all. they each remembered the humming noise which i had only just remembered shortly before i saw them.  my older brother also remembers. all 4 of us remember the exact same details so i know it was real.\r\ni have wanted to know if anyone else in bono or jonesboro saw anything that night, but no one seemed to believe us so we just didn't talk about it.\r\nthank you for letting me finally share my story. i know it's not the most exciting story out there but with the military helicopters chasing it i believe it is an important story.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

that outside of our home. we both love the sky and all its glory, so instantly when stepping out for a smoke on our front porch we start to look up. with in ten seconds she spots something through the tree that is kinda flickering and moving so she walks out to the drive to get a better view. she calls me over to observe and what we think we are looking at is a small group of lights all moving insync with one another. this is directly east and after a minute or two we look around a little more and we see there are 15 or more of these light groups placed throughout the sky. the closest one to us being northeast of us. it's so close that i can see the light that we thought were together but separate were all coming from a larger object. i could see its shape, i could see windows, i could see some kind of opening with a light light shining out when it did open. i could see something or maye a few things moving in said windows. we watched this thing for maybe an hour or so and then it all of a sudden shot out what looked to be a green missle that had end trails color matched coming off of it. it then with a small flash turned into the same craft that had shot it out. i was totally stunned and honestly while what we thought were a missle soaring through the sky, i grabbed my girlfriend and kinda held her right. we both thought something very bad was going to happen but there was no explosion, nothing like that. it just seriously turned into another craft. after watching this for another 15-45 minutes i'm not really sure, out of nowhere there was a bright light shooting down from the sky, i didn't see it come directly from this craft or another bit it definitely came from the area of the one we were observing for over an hour. it made its way through our big willow tree like it wasnt even there zipping through the branches with crazy ease. it was the size of a golf ball and the brightest white light i have ever seen. it came right up to my face, an inch or two away, zipped straight over to my girlfriends face who was a foot or two away from me. after spending about one or two seconds in my face and then hers, it shot straight back up into the air. neither of us could watch it leave us because we both felt worn out, not quite there, kinda just dull and almost unable to move. when i was able to \"come to\" i so surprised with what had happened asked her if that just happened. she looked as though she was about to cry. i still had to ask her what she had just witnessed like for some reason it wouldn't be the same as what i just experienced and she told me exactly what i had seen. the crafts stayed in the sky all through the night as we stayed out in our front yard still observing until the sun started to ride and the objects just seemed to fade away with the coming morning. we both will never forget this for the rest of our lives. we both have been sketchy about telling this encounter to anyone but we both can relive it like it was yesterday, not 4 years ago. as we both sit here on the couch, we started talking about it as the dozens of other times we have since that night. we decide to come forward and share this. we both have also seen things in the day and night sky we can't explain but this was huge. it was without a doubt the strangest thing i thought i would ever encounter that or any night.

never saw that before. \r\n  i drove to work anyway, uneventfully. the radio finally came back on and the day proceeded as usual.\r\n  i was a park maintenance worker and we were closing the ball fields for the winter. my job that day was to trailer the roller and drive to the parks. it was a crisp sunny day. as i was driving i started hearing the double beeps fairly consistently. they stopped and reoccurred. i got to our location and got out of the truck again hearing the beeps, steadier and very consistent at this point. not even considering that i am hearing these at various times and in various places, i asked my crew if they heard them too. of course they didn't and probably thought i was crazy.\r\n  i unloaded the roller and waited for the tractors to till and rake the field. i was then to roll the dirt, packing it for winter. as i sat on the roller the beeping became almost alarming. i put my earplugs in, thinking it would quiet down. it got louder. \r\n  not sure exactly happened at that point, but something \"told me\" from within that \"we're taking it out ( i knew exactly what \"they\" were talking about)we don't need you anymore. do not tell anyone about this. we know you will, but be aware there will be consequences and your children may be taken away. you will have another child\".\r\n  as tho this wasn't alarming enough, having another child was nowhere on my table. actually, that was the part that disturbed me the most. strangely, i did have another child under, what i would call, ironic circumstances.\r\n  with that i was \"back\" for lack of anything else to call it. there was dense fog and six huge white lights across the field. in a moment it was all gone and my crew was wondering why i was just sitting there. \r\n  i thought i'd lost my mind. i asked others if they saw anything and they did not, or did not admit it to me. they had obviously been working during my episode.\r\n  oddly enough i went on with the day as nothing had happened. that following weekend, i visited with my daughter and started to tell her and became hysterical in the restaurant, embarrassing her. she told me of things that had happened to her, similar to my event. \r\n  again, oddly enough, the whole thing just left my mind until a couple of years later, when my son saw something hovering outside our house. it all came flooding back. i stumbled across a book called close encounters of the 5th kind. there were many similarities in other peoples experiences as were in mine. i never knew there were others.\r\n  a lot of \"incidents\" that have happened to me since i was almost a baby, started becoming clear that i was not hallucinating or crazy. \r\n  there is so much more. i just can't write it at this time.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":65734,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.0844856,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05222015-0014","longitude":-76.87869649999999,"occurred":878284800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,  A","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1432348171000,"summary":"Double beeping for days, electric interference in vehicle, i put earplugs in and beeping got louder, i was told things by telepathy, fog and clearing","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6412,"locationName":"Laurel, Maryland","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:34490"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"St. Augustine","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Saw two jets chasing three one charged direction the sound maid  me stop my bike to look a jets and saw that were in personae of the ufosone moved away and leif very quickly . i also saw big foot with my firuther","distance":"501 Feet -

hands and feet tied, i tried to speak but i drooled because i had numbed my mouth could not close it, i had a set of gadgets around, these were very simple.\r\n\r\nwhen i regained most of my conscience, in front of me, no more than three meters, was one of those higher beings, he measured between 6 and a half feet tall, his chest was slightly thinner than a human and waist it was very close, her legs were long and tight clothes, looked like it was part of his body.\r\n\r\nthis being was interrogating a table to record data, he asked me things, such as: what was this and that ?. he showed me things that humans normally use shoes, bags, backpacks,\r\n\r\nsuddenly approached another, this was a woman, was female, and said that -for what he would do to her many questions, if you had given much of the dose, then would have to stop asking questions.\r\n\r\nthe woman approached me, she touched my forehead, he injected something and walked away. his hands were like those of an iguana, very tactile ridged footprints, and the termination of the fingers was large (fingers were big heads). the color of their skin was very pale green, mint, mixed with some white crystalline material as between gelatinous forming a layer as a cover, but when she touched me, i noticed that her skin was firm.\r\n\r\nthen he took me to go, and left the room where we were, coming out, it was a fully lit building with ramps and elevators that allowed up and down the ramps had no railings ramps and the center of the building was empty, ramps looked like it did not address anywhere, but to finish up or down these strange beings could open the walls as if they were gates or automatic doors, those doors were built horizontally, everything was lit with white lights. there was some of them working and they have some other people there, living the same that me.\r\n\r\nthen i went to wake up very thirsty, i was scared, with my numb mouth and tongue very hardened, not wrapped, or as if it

to tell this story but have kept it to myself for a very long period of time. just a dream? more than positive is was not.\r\n\r\nit was an evening in 1978, i was 9 years old i was in bed sleeping or at least i think i was, the whole experience felt like a dream and waking up with a feeling of waking to something i shouldnt of been witnessing. \r\n\r\nas far as i can remember it felt as if i was in bed then awakened looking out my living room window observing a dark rotating circular object with large rotating red lights that seem to rotate opposite of the rotating object.\r\n\r\ni observed this for a short period of time approximately 5 to 10 minutes. at this time my father was at work and i was home with my mother and older brother. what i found to be very strange and a mental image i cannot let go is that when the object ascended and was out of view i noticed my mother and brother walking away from behind me entering their bedrooms not saying a word very robotic like. i also remember saying to them as they walked away \" did you see that?\" and what was disturbing to me was the blank stare they both had and unresponsive as they entered their bedrooms.\r\n\r\nthe next day i remember asking my mother and brother about what we have seen and they could not associate the story whatsoever. i also remember telling my father about the incident and he chuckled. and the brief experience was never brought up again, just the memory of the incident.\r\n\r\nat this time and before i was a young artist,sculptor,and musician.I found after this incident that i was drawing alien type creatures with no visible mouths and with the well known large black eyes with claw type hands almost like a lobster claw,(still have the drawing) i have no idea why i was obsessed with drawing these images i was also drawing human females with no mouths. i also went through a period of dreams of these creatures and the objects they came from. one dream in particular was an impossible large sized object hovering over the forest in my back yard, so large it was fearful and the reason why i awoke from these dreams i was having.\r\n\r\n\r\nanother incident was my father awakened from sleep with a male figure at the edge of his bed with no mouth.After discussing this with the family i was shocked at the fact that he either had a dream of this male figure with no mouth or actually seen what he had seen. i never discussed my drawings with him and always had a fear of this coincidence.\r\n\r\ni am now 45 years old i am a graduate of design and animation and 3d arts. to this day i have a deep continuous interest in creating the same creatures i have had dreams of as a child. ive also noticed in the past 3 years i seem to see the numbers 123 on a daily basis and with witnesses to

plenty of light, a few clouds. cousin and i sitting in yard watching traffic on the small narrow country road at the corner of what is now railroad st and rittertown road in the small town of hampton, tn. we were looking in an easterly direction. cousin looked up and said, \"what is that?\" i looked up and saw a very large circular craft maybe 1000 feet or maybe a little more off the ground descending in a slant from right to left. it disappeared behind a large mountain to the left. it was so large it was probably one third as large as the mountain. it was grey or silver in color and had a shape similar to a round aspirin tablet with a side. we could see a little of the bottom side as well as the top. it did not make any sound nor do i remember any lights in the daylight. there was no smoke trail behind it. it was below the clouds so our vision was not impeded by any means. it was obviously a metal flying craft of a kind that doesn't even exist today, let alone in the mid-fifties. when i went to high school the next day several people from our little town talked about seeing it also. a story circulated that the newspaper in bristol, tn. had published a story the next day about a craft crashing in the mountains near there. the rumor was that several people went into the woods to investigate and smelled something like sulfer in the air and someone reported seeing a little man in a tree. this last part is only rumor but maybe there was a report in the paper. bristol, tn is in the exact direction the craft was headed when we last saw it. feelings were one of excitement and wonder. i have never forgotten the incident and wondered if anyone else who saw it has reported it to ufo investigators and if any investigation was ever completed. would sure like to hear of anything that was or is found.I just put a date of the incident although i don't remember specifically when it was. since i was in school, it had to be between august and june although it was not in the winter time. the weather was mild.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line

adjacent to a field, we noticed a bright light in the air just above rooftop level. to my left, i was driving, there were some homes under construction that had the reflective insulation panels nailed to the outside of them. i saw a flash of light suddenly that reflected from the panels and when i looked forward the light we had seen was directly ahead and level with us. as i turned the corner to continue on, i spotted this white rat come running across the road and then the car died at that moment. it took a couple of attempts to start the car again whereupon i looked in the rear view mirror and saw a dark figure in the back seat. i told my girlfriend not to look in the back seat and accelerated to her house. fortunately, her house was just a few blocks away. as we turned into the driveway, i continued to see this figure in the car. once we stopped, we both jumped out of the car and there was nothing in the car any longer. i can only surmise that this may have been an alien

on saturday morning, jan.31, we headed to a beach in pacifica ? , due west of san francisco, to enjoy the\r\nwarm weather they were experiencing, and to go to the only taco bell, located on a beach in the u.S.A..\r\n  we left san manteo about 10:30am, and took a route that traveled the hills and valleys towards the pacific coast. i sat shotgun with my brother in law, and our wifes in the back seat of his honda. we had the windows rolled up so the wind wouldn't blow back on the ladies, and i had my camera in hand to take pictures of the hilltops and coastline as we traveled to the beach.\r\n  i have a canon eos-60d camera, and shot random pics of landscapes and point of interests through the winshield and my side glass. as we got on the highway that was along the coast, and was heading down a long and steep highway towards pacifica, i shot numerous pictures of the rugged hillside and ocean vistas. i focused mostly on the shoreline that was approx. 1/4 mile away from us, as we decended towards the bottom of the large hilltop.\r\n  i occasionally looked at the lcd screen to see some of the pics were worthy of keeping, because of the occasional car or pole getting into some pics. we spent the day and returned, and reviewed the pictures on the lcd screen, until we returned home and i put them on my pc at home.\r\n  i was editing the pictures with corels paintshop pro 7, for color correcting, cropping, etc., when i came to the beach pictures taken from the car. i did have some bothersome reflections on some, but when i zoomed in to look at what i thought was a plane, or sharp reflection, to me it\r\nlooks like a white disc or cigar shape object. i searched the other pictures of this outing, and found others with various images near the same location on each frame, except a couple where it has moved to the north away from a hilltop. also zooming in, there seems to be a field of energy disturbing the area around the object, like heat off a highway, or a bullet passing through the air when viewed from a scope.\r\n  i am not ruling anything out, just wanted to get opinions of others to see if this was a craft, or reflection. notice the sequence of the image numbers in which the order they were taken. \r\n  also notice the distortion of the leading edges of the object that, they seem to re-shape in some of the pictures. \r\n i showed these to family and friends and they think something was there\r\nand i should submit them to somebody for scrunity.
