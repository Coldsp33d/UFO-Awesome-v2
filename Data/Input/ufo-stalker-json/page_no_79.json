way in marina del rey south bound on lincoln on my way home to manchester ave. & pershing drive in playa del rey.  when i reached jefferson blvd. i turned right on to jefferson proceeding in a westerly direction heading to culver blvd.  this now put me in the ballona wetlands which is quiet dark as there are no lights/buildings/homes/etc., as this is wildlife preserve.  \r\n\r\napproximately a quarter mile while driving i shut off my headlights trying adjust my instrument panel lights. almost immediately i saw an object appear/light-up  off to the right about 400 to 500 feet altitude  approximately  600 feet or less from my vehicle; there was no perceptible sound whatsoever from said object.  i immediately turned my head lights back on and at that instant the object light(s) went out and the object was no longer visible to me or my passenger. note that my passenger's description of the object was a very large bright white light circular in shape.\r\n\r\nthe duration of our observation was between 2 to 3 seconds.  later this day i removed my memory chip from my blackvue dr650-1ch dash camera and found a partial visible light from the subject encounter, however, it did not fully show what i saw with my own eyes. i am sending you a copy of the recording thinking that you have video equipment that can offer  better details than i can on my home computer with the basic blackvue software.\r\n\r\ni grew up in the flight path of santa monica airport, completed ground flight school and some actual hours in flight, have over three decades working in aero space and have lived next to lax for the past eight years. this object was total foreign and unidentifiable to me.  doses this not constitute what is commonly referred to as a ufo, i think so, therefore, i am submitting pertinent excerpts from my car videos for analysis.\r\n","distance":"101-500

pattern heading south. each with three \"very white lights\" forming a triangle with a very faint outline of a triangular body.  i would guess an altitude of 10-15,000 ft since we are in the flight path of commercial jets flying though california. compared to what we normally see size wise of jets these two crafts were twice the size of a commercial jet based on their normal altitude.\r\nboth were very vivid. the white lights were unlike normal commercial aircraft.\r\noccasionally we could see a random white light flash..But very randomly. \r\nno colored navigation lights like normal commercial aircraft. no sounds noted.\r\nafter about 15 seconds they separated with one gradually fading east while the other continued\r\nheading south. we watched both for about 4 minutes as they faded into the eastern and southern horizon.\r\ni'm not sure what they were but they were not normal by any means.  the whiteness of the lights were very bright similar to small white led lights. the closeness of them flying together seemed very unusual for typical aircraft. one was slightly behind the other and the distance between them was equal to their

started sharing this experience with family and friends because my father had his own experience within the last couple years.\r\ni remember waking up at about 3:30 am on top of my bed, my bedsheets were made perfectly, all the corners crisp and everything, and my blinds were pulled tightly open, and i was incredibly awake like i had to look out my window and i had a feeling in my stomach, kind of like a \"no-gravity\" feeling. i look outside in the distance directly to the west of me in my bed, and there is this very large lemon-shaped bright yellow object very slowly traveling to my left, so south. it was going in a perfectly straight path and moving at a constant speed, what i would think to be like 3 mph but was probably a little faster given the distance it was away from me. \r\ni just kept staring and feeling the weird feeling in my stomach like i was frozen and terrified looking at this object. there is a large pine tree past the garage outside my window, and i knew that if it went behind that pine tree and did not come out the other side i must be seeing things. i waited and waited as it slowly surfaced onto the left side of the pine tree. my best guess is that this object was around 3-5 football fields away. as it kept slowly moving south, it started moving towards the aspen tree that was in our front yard, and as it approached around some of the first branches it just disappeared completely. the feeling in my stomach was let go, i became physically less tense but then a new feeling of reality set in that made me feel incredibly fearful and scared and confused. i felt like it wanted me to watch it, like it woke me up to watch it. i was so confused why my bed was made, i was on top of all the sheets and comforter and everything, and i was very confused why my blinds were pulled tightly open. i do not know if i did that or if something else had happened that i don't remember. i know that at that time i had watched some movie on lifetime about a stalker, and i would always shut my blinds before the sun went down because i was scared somebody would crawl onto the garage and could see me through my window, so i knew i had to have closed those blinds. i also never made my bed, especially that neat, but i really have no explanation to those parts of my experience. i also remember there was no sound that i could hear from the object, and my window was closed, but i could usually hear the cars on the busy street west of my house, and i could see the lights from the cars, but during the few minutes i saw the object i don't remember seeing any cars going down that street, or my street. i know i didn't see any other objects like airplanes or anything in the sky, and it was crystal clear out that night. i do remember seeing stars in the sky. the whole experience was maybe 5-8 minutes, and it felt like the world was absolutely silent and still while i had this weird and frightening connection-experience to this object.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:08:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

directly above the other about a car's length  apart moved very slowly directly across the sky. it moved parallel to the ground and seemed to be hovering about 200ft off the ground. then it slowed down, turned on a dime, and the lights either faded out, or it shot off into the darkness. it was difficult to tell which, though i think  it flew away as there was nothing there after the lights went

88710 de la bahía mazarredo, con los 5 suvs blancos.\r\nesos vehículos estuvieron en fitz roy a la medianoche del 28 para el 29 de noviembre, pasaron por el pueblo todos juntos y estuvieron detenidos como 1 hora en la banquina de la ruta nac. 3, no se bajó nadie en ningún momento.\r\nestuvieron siempre con las luces encendidas y las balizas puestas, después siguieron camino hacia el sur por la misma ruta.\r\nleí todo lo que cuentan en el caso 88710 de mufon y preste atención estos días ya que la bahía mazarredo está muy cerca de fitz roy, ese caso termina con una pregunta en ingles \"¿coincidencia?\".\r\ncon mucha pena estos últimos 2 días leí y hasta vi un video donde se usa ese texto de mufon y se le agregan cosas que no tienen nada que ver con ese caso, como el submarino ara san juan perdido y el experimento filadelfia, esas cosas agregadas están tomadas de los pelos y son irresponsables e irrespetuosas para con los familiares de la tripulación del ara san juan que están sufriendo por la pérdida de sus seres queridos.\r\nquien escribió esos artículos y quien hizo el video no solo han sido crueles con los deudos de la tripulación del submarino, sino que además son ignorantes porque cuando hacen los mapas del área de búsqueda no tienen en cuenta que el submarino se perdió como a 700 km de la costa, y cualquiera que viva en patagonia o en cualquier otro lugar del mundo donde haya torres de comunicaciones sabe que una torre de unos 50 metros (la altura de la barranca donde estaba el \"cono\" que tenían esas raras personas) solo alcanza a comunicarse a unos 50 km de distancia porque la curvatura terrestre limita la comunicación punto a punto.\r\nlo aportado en el caso 88710 de mufon es interesante porque no es la primera vez acá en el sur que vemos esos suvs, pero el giro y agregados que le dieron algunos es una verdadera vergüenza.\r\ngracias, quería dejar constancia de esto porque acá  en la patagonia hay gente que investiga estos misterios pero seriamente y no me gustaría que nos confundan a quienes acá vivimos.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":88754,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-49.271246,"location":null,"logNumber":"AR-12132017-0017","longitude":-73.04322599999999,"occurred":1511913600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

according to radar, traveling 5,000 mph.  as the craft neared us it slowed down and stopped over us. it was hovering at 35,000 feet, about 15 miles from us. it was as big as a football field. it stayed hovering over us, when we turned it turned, this went on until my shift ended, for about an hour. the craft was metallic gray with no lights and no features on the skin of the craft. when i was relieved of duty i got some refreshment and came back topside to watch it further. it had just left going east towards europe. when it first appeared it seemed to have come from the tip of scotland by way of norway over the sea.\r\nafterwards i went to the bridge to look at the log book to see what had been recorded about this incident. nothing was mentioned about the ufo and the handwriting and ink was identical to both separate listings in the log book. very unlikely since the same person and pen would not have made both entries. the next day we pulled into port in england and nothing was ever said about the incident. i was in the navy from 1956 to 1976. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

tree when, in the predawn light, i saw 3 bright and stationary lights/objects just above the horizon at approximately a 30-35 degree angle off to my ne direction. these 3 objects were formed in a triangle pattern; the point/single object pointing north/ne. the bottom left to the south/sw, and the third to the right was south/se. they were hovering/stationary for approximately a full minute +/-. i thought at first glance, that they were helicopters, but definitely not! ( i drive up and down hwy 115 which parallels ft.Carson, and i see helicopters all the time;both day and night. that's not it). since i drive this section of i-25 on a pretty regular basis, i am familiar with the surrounding area and the sky light. i knew these were not radio or cell towers at all. the objects appeared to be either triangle or even square in shape/outline.All three were emitting a very bright and constant and somewhat patterned white light. there was definitely a shape/outline to these objects, and not just an orb of light,(even in the predawn light.So they were definitely close.1 mile or less away).Then, all of a sudden, the craft at the point of the triangle goes from stationary to zooming off to the ne at a ridiculous speed, and out of my sight in less than 1 second. just a quick light trail was all i saw for that second. the other two objects remained stationary for another 1-2 seconds, then they took off at the same ridiculous speed. the bottom right object shot off to the east/ne.Again, out of my sight within a second!The other object,(which delayed it's departure for 1-2 seconds), on the bottom left of the formation, shot off to the west/nw.Before this third object disappeared from my sight, i observed it change direction and cut back to head north/ne, as if to catch up to the other two craft! wow! this change of direction was done at the same/or close to the same speed, as it's straight line flight speed.And the change of direction was essentially made at an 80-90 degree angle.\r\n  now, unless this is/was a top secret/experimental air force craft,(technology maybe going back to the days of \"operation paperclip\" or reversed engineering from downed spacecraft found and covered up by the military and/or government), i truly and honestly can say that what i saw was indeed a formation of u.F.O.'s i was very excited to have had the chance to have experienced such a sight!! what an opportunity! i am a

(see attached annotated maps.) the old farmhouse that i was approaching is located between us 89 and the old highway.  about 3/4 miles or so to the south of the old farmhouse the old highway joins up with us 89.  on the night in question, i walked along the old highway road (starting form my home in town) until less than about a quarter mile from where it joins up with us 89.  at that point, i turned around and returned home by the same route.\r\n\r\nit was a very dark night, with no moon, with the stars very brilliant in a clear sky with no clouds that i could tell.  it was also very cold, and i had a warm coat on with a hat covering my ears.  i could see the constellation orion very brightly in the east not too far above the horizon, and the two stars at the end of the big dipper which line up with the north star were just to the east of a northerly direction. \r\n\r\nas i was walking to the southwest away from the town, the lights from the town and the nearby sheriff’s building provided less and less light to see the road.  occasional headlights from passing vehicles on nearby us 89 at times lit up the road i was walking on, and also at times were a bit blinding.  walking near the old farmhouse was easier to see the road, as there was a bright light on a pole illuminating the area immediately to the south of the old farmhouse.  when i was at the further parts south from town during my walk, with the farmhouse light no longer visible, the road at times was very difficult to see in the darkness, and often i had to navigate the center of the road by feeling with my feet the sloping of the surface away from the crown of the center part of the paving of the road.  the starlight, however, did provide a faint outline of the edges of the road if i looked hard.\r\n\r\nas i was approaching the farmhouse (about 400 yards or so away), at the initial sighting point, i noticed some unusual lights up in the sky to my left or towards the east or southeast, and clearly above the closer foothills of the high mountains to the east of our valley.  it took a moment or two of mental processing to realize what i was seeing was not like the usual sights i have seen so often in the night sky.  when i first saw them is when they were closest, and the long string of these lights initially and impressively filled the sky or my field of vision, until the mass of lights grew smaller as they moved towards the southwest. \r\n\r\ni am very familiar with aircraft, aircraft lighting, red rotating beacons, white aircraft flashing strobe lights, etc.  i used to fly in the air force (i am now a retired officer from the air force), and i am presently building a light aircraft.  while many of the features of these lights that i was then seeing in the sky above to my left were similar to some features of aircraft lighting, the overall presentation was very unusual, and not at all like is so typically seen in the sky.\r\n\r\nthere were from 25 to 30 points of light, apparently separate from each other, following each other in single file, as they moved towards the southwest.  i tried to count them, but it was difficult to get an accurate count.  they were not in a perfect straight line as if they were all attached to some very long, straight pole, as there was some vertical alignment variation (but not much) from light to light from an absolutely straight line, but still in a very organized single file.  what was singular and unusual was that their spacing one after the other was very uniform.  in my personal air force flying experience, when aircraft fly in formation, one is not just behind another, but somewhat to the side of the lead aircraft.  these did not appear to be following any such formation, nor was it an “echelon” formation, with the aircraft behind slightly below the aircraft in front.  the problem with aircraft flying directly behind each other, is that the plane behind is subject more to turbulence from the prop, jet engine(s), or the wings of an aircraft immediately in front.  so aircraft formation flights are not single file.  the closeness of one “craft” to the one in front in the formation i saw seemed to present a danger of a wash or turbulence from the craft in front for normal aircraft.\r\n\r\ni could see no silhouette of whatever shape these craft might have had—only lights.  i tried to estimate the height and distance of these objects in the sky.  the “crispness” or clarity of the lights for me made them far closer than when i see, for example, an airliner above 30,000 feet, which we see every night around here.  because of my interest in aviation, i sometimes calculate the height and speed of general aviation aircraft i see locally during the day, based on the apparent wingspan of the aircraft against the thickness of my thumb at arms length.  (i also have a degree in engineering)  based on what i have observed and calculated seeing general aviation aircraft locally, these lights seemed to be at a height of from 2,500 to 5,000 feet above the ground here, which would make the msl altitude to be from 8,000 to 11,500 feet.  the altitude where i saw these lights is very close to 5,500 feet msl.  i could not tell if the path followed by these lights prior to when i first saw them came along and above the closer foothills of our eastern mountain range, or if their path brought them over the eastern mountain range of our valley.  the eastern mountain range to our valley tops out most places around 10,000 to 10,500 feet, and perhaps a tad higher in only a few places.\r\n\r\nbased on this kind of altitude, i would estimate their speed to be between 120 and 180 mph.  they did not apparently vary in speed, and their single file formation was unchanging from when i first saw this flight of craft or lights until they disappeared without changing direction at all to the southwest.  i could be mistaken in my altitude and speed estimates, especially as i had no wingspan to measure against the thickness of my thumb at arm’s length, but that is how it seemed, based on the apparent closeness of the lights and their clarity, and my previous estimates of light aircraft in the area.  stated another way, these lights seemed to have about the same apparent velocity or angular velocity as do the airliners above 30,000 feet, or perhaps a bit more apparent velocity, but not much.  clearly they were much closer than airliners at altitude.\r\n\r\nmore on the lights themselves.  each of the lights had a red pulsating light feature, virtually the same as what i know many civilian and military aircraft have, like a rotating beacon.  there were some flashing white lights, basically the same as the white flashing strobe lights that aircraft have at night.  but not every craft or light had the flashing white or “strobe” lights.  it seemed that only about one in every five or so craft (evenly spaced in the formation) had the flashing white “strobe” lights.  but they all had a pulsating red light.  this was pretty consistent throughout the entire formation.  \r\n\r\nthis, while unusual in practice, still seems like a large formation of military or civilian aircraft.  however, there were two other features that did not seem normal.  first of all, there were no position lights at all that i could see—green on the right wingtip, red on the left, and white on the tail.  even the airliners above 30,000 feet have position lights that i can see on a clear night, and the night of december 9 here was very clear.  but these had no position lights at all that i could see.  \r\n\r\nsecondly, these craft were totally and utterly silent.  i stopped walking two or three times when no trucks or automobiles were near, took off my hat, and tried to listen carefully.  no noise at all.  no jet noise, no engine noise, no prop or helicopter rotor noise.  no noise at all, and with no cars or trucks around, it was otherwise very silent.  even the high airliners are audible, though seeing them does precede their jet noise by several seconds.  but these lights had no noise associated with them at all, and as stated above, they clearly were much closer than an airliner.\r\n\r\nas i continued my walk to the south, and the formation of lights finally disappeared in the distance in the southwest, i then noticed a second formation of the exact same lights, with all the same features and descriptive elements, following the exact same path the first had taken, until they finally disappeared in the distance in the same location.  the only difference is when i counted the lights in the second formation, i counted between 12 and 14 total, or about half as many as in the first formation.  again, each had a pulsating red light, and every five or so had a flashing white “strobe.”  the second formation was identical in all ways to the first, except in size or number.\r\n\r\ni finally reached my turn around point in my walk as described above after the second formation disappeared.  i didn’t see any more of the same lights, but i did see a few other lights which were definitely aircraft, virtually all of these others airliners.  typical aircraft lights and appearance were not at all like the two formations that i saw that night.  \r\n\r\nthe next night i repeated the same identical walk as the previous night, but did not see again any of the unusual lights described above, only that which were clearly normal aircraft.  the night and atmospheric conditions the second night were identical to the previous night when i saw the formations.\r\n\r\nmy first impression was that i was seeing a large formation of military helicopters carrying troops on some kind of exercise.  but then for several reasons above, this didn’t seem to add up in my mind.  we do occasionally have military helicopters fly over our valley in the day, and they make an awful racket.  even slightly higher up as i estimate these lights to be (somewhat above the altitude that i have personally seen military helicopters above our valley), i can’t imagine that one wouldn’t hear a military helicopter—especially a large formation of them of one to two dozen.  it also occurred to me that these lights might have been objects being towed by a lead aircraft, but in contemplating the formation, it was far, far too long for this to be the case.\r\n\r\ni have studied the phenomenon of ufos considerably for over 25 years, have read dozens of books on them, and have even written on the subject.  i attended one day of a mufon convention once in albuquerque.  i have personally met and corresponded with stanton friedman, and personally met and spoken with kevin randle, don schmitt, phil klass, and others.  phil klass impressed me very much as being very disingenuous in his debunking work.  i sat next to him during the mufon convention, and it was a wonderful experience to witness his methods.  i became utterly convinced after having met him and interacted with him for a little while that he knows exactly what he is (or was—god rest his soul) doing.  i have followed steven greer’s work closely, and i have taken the critical course on this whole subject in my mind, that while i’d love to know the truth of it all, above all i want to be rational about it, and not jump to unwarranted conclusions, or fall victim to emotion or sensationalism.  i have never seen a “ufo” in the classical sense myself, though i have spoken with many people who have.  \r\n\r\ni would tend to think that what i witnessed the other night has a mundane, though unusual explanation, but i would really like to know what these lights might have been.  as mentioned above, my first glimpse was quite impressive, as the string of lights occupied pretty much my entire field of view.  any help to determine just what i saw the other night would be very welcome.  thank you so much.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:25:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
