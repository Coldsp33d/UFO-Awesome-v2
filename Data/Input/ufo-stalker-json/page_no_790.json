the event), and 2 friends.  returned to the car parking lot after the play and, while my friend was attempting to back out of a tight parking space, i looked up at the night sky hoping to see the planet jupiter, prominent in the sky at that time.  the sky was somewhat hazy with sufficient light pollution that only the brightest objects were visible.  i spotted a bright star-like object that i at first suspected was jupiter, but later realized was the bright star arcturus in bootes.  shortly after that observation (facing east), i noticed a very small object to the right of arcturus moving left toward the star.  at first i suspected it to be a satellite or \"space junk\" that i have observed numerous times in the night sky at home in chautauqua county.  but on closer examination, despite the fairly poor seeing conditions, i realized that i could see textural and color details on the object.  i ascertained that it was perfectly round, red on the outer margins gradually grading to orange toward the center, where the color was a distinct white. as i was observing these details, i caught the appearance of second, identical orb, below and trailing behind the first one.  their apparent separation was equivalent to about a three inch separation of thumb and fore-finger on my outstretched arm.  they made no noise, and their speed was that of very fast satellite objects.  they eventually flew past arcturus and merged close together before both came to a full, dead stop.  it was then that my son and i realized that these were not ordinary satellites.  in fact, they were probably not satellites at all!  they maintained a constant distance at a dead stop for probably a bit less than 5 minutes, until the upper orb (#1) reversed course and flew back the way it had come.  shortly after, the 2nd orb also reversed course but before moving very far it performed an amazing rapid zig-zag dance -- at which point my son and i explained in unison \"[expletive deleted]did you see that?!\"  at this point it was clear that we were observing our first sighting of a genuine ufo, actually, two ufos.  we watched as they flew side-by-side in an apparently constant separation heading off in a westerly direction.  our observations were terminated by our friends who had succeeded in extracting their car and were anxious to head home to fredonia.  they never saw the two orbs, and have since regretted not stepping out of the car when we implored them to do so.","distance":"Over One

jumbo jet crashing.  that thought lasted as long as it took to have it.  a second.  it was a very large object close to the ground.  i sped up and reached the top of the hill and could clearly see the object.  i proceeded to drive to the end of the road and pull over.  i was approximately 400 feet away.  i proceeded to get out of my car and noticed that as i stepped onto the gravel road the sound was amplified.  i then paid attention that there was no sound of rustling grass or sounds of birds or animals that i was familiar with in the area.  it felt like i could only hear what was happening within my bubble of a few feet.  i threw a rock and didn't here it land several feet away.  but i heard my breathing and the sound of my feet and clothing very loudly.  also the sound of my own voice seemed much louder.  i noticed a metal taste in the air... a strange way to smell the air, by taste.  as for the sound.  only a strange hum.  but i place that with the strange sound bubble i seemed to be in.  as for the craft it was a dull silver colored metal.  there seemed to be something running down the center of the item.  there seemed to be almost a seam.  possible view port.  there appeared to be a pattern on the metal.  but i wasn't close enough to see detail.  i got in and out of my car several times paying attention to the sounds and smells.  my two young children were in the back seat asleep so i rolled the window down to ensure i couldn't be locked out.  i wouldn't go more than 5 feet from the car because of the children.   i wanted to walk out into the field to get closer.  i had a strange  euphoric feeling.  i was excited and happy and calm.  this surprised me after that i wasn't afraid.  i also had this strong sense that someone was watching me aware i was watching them.  hard to explain.  this was a full daylight sighting.  after watching for about 8 minutes the craft started to move.  there was a lumbering metal bending noise and the sound around me returned to normal. i got back into my car and started it.  the craft was slowly moving north (my left).  i turned left onto hwy 7.  the craft lumbered overhead of me until i was directly beneath it.  it cast a shadow.  it was definately disc shaped.  there appeared to be a circular piece on the underside that appeared like it could open.  this appeared to be closing as it was directly overhead.  then the craft began to accelerate and gain altitude slowly at first then gained speed  suddenly.  from the onset on acceleration to the point the craft \"zipped\" off was only a couple seconds.  then after it was a quarter mile fom me it was instantly shooting across the prairie 10 miles in a second and gone.  at that point i lost sight of object. from the point before it's incredible speed jump it changed

it was the boogeyman. until i was 15 years old and was watching a show about alien encounters and it was showing different aliens that had been seen throughout the world. on this program, i saw, for the first time since my encounter, this alien being that i had seen that night. i was in complete shock and excited that i had finally discovered what i had seen that night when i was 5 years old. i have been searching for this picture since that day i saw it on tv and i can't find it yet again. i really want to find out more about this being i had seen.

galeana junto con mi hijo aproximadamente a las 11:00 a.M. y observamos entre 17 y 22 de estos objetos; el lapso de tiempo transcurrido hasta llegar a casa es de 15 min. al llegar a casa tomé mis binoculares y video cámara handy cam mod. ccd trv75 y subí a la azotea para ver si lograba obtener imágenes del avistamiento que horas antes habíamos visto, fue cuando minutos después logro ver a lo lejos 7 objetos que se desplazaban al nor-oeste de la cd. de méxico y perdiéndose por el horizonte; al terminar de grabar y 30 segundos más tarde observo que 5 objetos regresan a la zona donde me encontraba y comienzo a grabar. la mejor de las flotillas ovnis que he grabado, se encontraban a una altura aproximada de 4,000 a 5,000 metros en este caso venían de una trayectoria del nor-poniente hacia el sur-oriente rumbo aproximado el aeropuerto o col. moctezuma, como pueden apreciar se tratan de naves tipo combate o algún animal volador desconocido aparentaban un forma como de guerra de las galaxias o galáctica, lamentablemente las naves pasaron por mi zenit y el tope del tripie me impidió seguir grabando, ya que al girar el tripie el sol me deslumbro y las perdí, de todas formas es una evidencia contundente que pocos han tenido, cabe la pena  señalar que parece que el radar del aeropuerto internacional de la ciudad de méxico detecto su presencia ya que durante un buen rato no observe aterrizajes, despegues o paso de aviones que toman trayectoria de rumbo, y posteriormente cuando se fueron se normalizo el trafico aéreo. esta grabación, la procesé en las partes donde comienzan a verse los objetos a baja velocidad de reproducción (.30x), y corregí la imagen para verse lo más natural posible y no perder detalle de los elementos importantes, en los puntos de velocidad normal no tiene cambios de corrección de imagen y se presenta en su grabación normal; es importante señalar que cuando el reloj de la grabación marca 11:22;58 el segundo objeto de izquierda a derecha (el más alto) se observa como si aleteara pero sin extender las alas como lo hacen los pájaros; aquí es donde mus dudas comienzan ¿ serán naves o animal volador desconocido ?  además existe en una parte casi al final del video que aparece un objeto más a gran velocidad, en un momento pensé que se trataba de un pájaro pero tengo dudas al respecto, ya que si fuera un pájaro presentaría un color totalmente obscuro y éste presenta tonalidad blanca en su centro, ustedes juzguen y se respeta su postura.\r\nen caso que se pensara que son pájaros tuve la fortuna de grabar un a parvada un día después del avistamiento ovni y que permite poder comparar el comportamiento de ambas grabaciones descartando por completo que sean pájaros,  llegué a la siguiente conclusión:\r\n1.- la flotilla tenían una altura aproximada de 4,000 a 5,000 mtrs.\r\n2.- en la grabación se logran ver sus rasgos, presentan una ligera inclinación hacia abajo ya que se el frente y no se les observa la parte baja de los objetos estos se encontraban cerca del zenit, se observan planeando con las alas quebradas en forma de triángulo.\r\n3.- por la altura que presentaban cálculo un diámetro entre 20 a 30 mtrs. ya que de lo contrario no podrían verse sus rasgos.\r\n4.- la parvada vuela en círculos y avanzan, volaba a una altura aproximada de 1,000 a 1,500 mtrs., su vuelo planeado es con las alas extendidas y por momentos aletean, su observación es siempre por la parte de abajo, a pesar de estar más bajo su vuelo, apenas logran verse sus rasgos como son cuello y alas. se calcula un diametro entre 1.00 a 2.50 mts.\r\n5.- observación de vuelo, un pájaro no puede planear con las alas quebradas de lo contrario se vendría a pique, los objetos en un principio 7 avanzaron en dirección hacia el cerro del chiquihuite y 30 segundos después 5 objetos regresaron, cosa que si fueran aves regularmente no regresan por el punto donde ya habían pasado.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

and one strange light! i didn't notice the light until after watching it. i kept my camera recording on the car lot across the road for the most part, to have some light in the video. after reviewing the video, i noticed a light bouncing around, then i zoom up to the moon and back to the car lot business, then the light reappears in the same area, but lower and bouncing more. the sound is what was really strange! the sound was louder than the recorded sound. i probably had my volume turned down, but it was really loud!\r\n\r\nanyway, i posted the video on my youtube channel and many people from nearby towns said they heard the sound, too, but at different times. another person emailed me directly. and then a person said (as you can see in the comments) that i should report this to mufon. most people didn't even notice the bouncing light, although i mentioned it in my initial comments about the video.\r\n\r\ni have the recording on my phone, on my pc and on my youtube channel. i didn't do any editing at all. if i had noticed the light when i was recording, i would've recorded longer!\r\n\r\nlook, i'm just a regular working person and my youtube channel is all about books, because i read a lot and write books, too (using a pen name).\r\n\r\ni don't want the cia or nasa coming to take my phone or laptop, weird people calling me or aliens visiting me or anyone calling me crazy. i'm

between 10:30 and 11 p.M. as we were sitting in the vehicle, i heard a sound like an aircraft passing by. i got out of the vehicle, looked up to the sky and seen a triangular shaped ufo. i am a huge believer in ufo's and extraterrestrials, so as soon as i seen it, i got very excited and told me boyfriend to hurry and look at it too. upon seeing it, i immediately thought that it was an alien space ship. it was amazing! since it was night time, i couldn't see the craft itself, so it must have been black. i seen round, white lights on the corners of the craft, that is how i could tell what the shape was. there was one light on each corner, so three altogether. there was also a shape in the middle of the craft that was red or orange in color and from what i could tell, it looked like it was round with a straight line coming from it. it moved like an ordinary aircraft, moving average speed in a straight line as it traveled. it moved from south to north and i couldn't see it anymore because it was out of view. i must say, i was like a kid in a candy store. haha","distance":"101-500

saturday in june, 2011 at about 3 - 4 pm.  the weather was sunny with some clouds.  we were relaxing outside on our deck watching hawks soaring on thermals through binoculars.  i took notice of what i thought was a gliding hawk and picked up the binoculars for a closer look.  it was clearly a small,  disc shaped object with a slight but distinctive “wobble” with no other distinguishing features.  the color was a flat light grey very similar to a military aircraft paint.  the location was to our south no more than 2 miles from our home and heading east in a straight line.  comparing the size, speed, altitude and location to the small aircraft that fly in and out of sussex airport,  my best guesses would be a diameter around 20 feet, 6-7 feet tall, speed around 200 mph, altitude about 3,000 feet and above the vicinity of route 284 between sussex borough and unionville, ny.  i watched it for about 30 seconds until it was lost from view.  at the time, i thought i was watching a military drone due to it's  color.  about 2-4 days later, i caught another glimpse of the same object from our backyard deck.  it flew directly overhead heading north, northeast.  i only saw it for about 10 seconds between trees, but it was lower than the first sighting (about 2,000 feet) and the “wobble” appeared more like a conventional aircraft's dutch roll.  we could call it a wobble with a wiggle!  there was no noise, markings, lights or vapor trail.  that was the last daytime sighting.  we did, however, see an odd light flying in the night sky twice that summer.  it flew in paths similar to the second sighting and once flew in a curved path.  it’s difficult to judge the height, but it was low - no more than 3,000 feet and comparing it to a small aircraft, flew at twice their speed or 200 - 250 mph.  it was a large, round, bright, solitary light that didn’t appear to throw a beam.  no sound, no navigation or other blinking lights.  the durations were 25 to 30 seconds as sight was lost due to trees and the times were between 9 and 10pm.  as before, i thought that there was some sort of drone testing taking place overhead. \r\n\r\none final mention.  the airspace above wantage open for aerobatics, balloons, paragliding, skydiving - just about anything.  a drone test wouldn’t surprise me.
