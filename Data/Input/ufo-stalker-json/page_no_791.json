certainly not. too big. and any pilot would have to be crazy to fly at that altitude around here. the faa has a major presence in this area, as we are about 10 miles south of lax and in close proximately to 3 municipal airports. i can't stop thinking about it and am curious if anyone else has reported the same sighting at about the same time.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":65679,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.87598078105088,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05202015-0002","longitude":-118.407325758906,"occurred":1430367000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1432108538000,"summary":"I saw a low-flying, strange-looking craft from my home on april 29, 2015.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"90254","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":20,"locationName":"Hermosa Beach, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:34844"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Burbank","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Back in about september 2004, i was living in the tri-cities area, wa. i had an incredible upclose ufo encounter that i would like to share.\r\n\r\ni thought it was late at night, when it happened, but apparently, upon finding out later, it wasn't as late as i thought. the encounter has left me with some memory/time loss issues. i have thought about hypnosis, but i'm worried that i might not like what i find. however, i have not had any nightmares, so that's why i still toy with the thought of hypnosis. it seems that people who have unpleasant experiences are plagued with nightmares, which i'm not. so, maybe my encounter was one of inspiration, not terror.\r\n\r\nthe place i lived there, was in a suburb of, pasco, wa, called, burbank, and it was very dark at night, as it's in a more rural area. you can see stars out clearly on a clear night. usually, it's very quiet, too, except for the freeways, north and south, bound, close to where i lived.\r\n\r\ni went outside to smoke a cigarette, which i did back in 2004, and i thought it was very late, like in the early am. so, i lit my smoke, and noticed that one of my shoes was untied. so, i leaned over to tie it, and as i did, a neon green light started forming around me.\r\n\r\nterrorified, i looked quickly to the sky, and something like about a quarter mile up, or probably less, since it was hard to gauge as it was very dark, a large silhouette of a large roundish craft was slowly making its way across the, burbank, sky. it was a large ufo. all you could see was a rounded silhouette blackness against the backdrop of a million stars. this craft must have had a cloaking device activated. since i could see pure blackness slowly moving across the sky against the stars, it must've had a cloaking device on. i was instantly impressed with it. i was somewhere between awestruck, and terrified. i watched as this craft made no sound whatsoever. something that large, should be making noise, it wasn't. also, there was neon green flame licks coming out the backside of the craft, too. the flames licks moved like fire from a fireplace, but, the flames licks moved in a timed rhythmical fashion. the green flame licks, also, made absolutely no sound. it was strange, because not only was there no sound, but the fire wasn't lighting up the entire area either. whatever i was witnessing was unlike anything i ever saw on television, and highly, highly advanced in technology.\r\n\r\nas i watched this, i looked to the ground, and realized that the green light that was around me was a circular neon green light about 5 feet in diameter, and was now moving away from me, across my backyard. i looked at this green circle, and deduced it must be coming from the ufo, because it was the same color as the green flame lick fire exhaust. however, i'm used to seeing a beam of light coming from the bottom of, ufo's, on tv. there was no beam of light coming from the craft, it was just a 5 foot circle of green light moving slowly on the ground by itself, wierd.\r\n\r\ni looked back up to the, ufo, and thought about going in, and waking up my buddy i was living with, but i didn't because i was so awestruck, and was afraid i might miss something.\r\n\r\nit occured to me, as well, that i must be the only one witnessing this event, because no one was screaming, and cars weren't honking, so i came to the conclusion that e.T. must be checking me out?? it was very surreal to say the least. i thought an amazing event like this would have cars honking, people screaming, but none of that was happening.\r\n\r\ni can't remember how it ended. therefore, i suspect that i could have been abducted/taken aboard craft. anyways, the next day, i talked to my buddy, and asked him if i told him about the ufo event, and he said, yes. i ended up finding out that it wasn't in the am this happened, either. actually, it was in the pm, and we were watching a movie, when i deceided to go out for a quick smoke break. so, as soon as i went outside, my memory issues must have begun, because i have no recollection of even watching the movie. this is why i believe i was abducted/taken aboard craft. most memory issues or tied to this. moving on, my buddy said that he saw some lights through the window, but figured it was just cars. so, while he's watching television, i'm outside having an incredible ufo experience, wow!\r\n\r\nmy buddy said that, when i came back inside, finally, it looked like i had seen a ghost, and that i was very quiet the rest of the night. my memory, and sense of being alert, didn't return until the next day. that's when i asked him, if i had told him about the ufo event, and he said, yes. so, that's when i started figuring out that something else must have happened, but i can't bring myself to go under hypnosis.\r\n\r\nno, i wasn't on drugs, or drunk, and it is what it is. i know this happened, so it doesn't matter if anyone believes me.\r\n\r\ni do know this that we are not alone. i took, astronomy, at college. we have a sun in our solar system, and our solar system is large, right? our sun is one of millions of suns, aka stars, in our own galaxy. there are millions, billions, of galaxies out there, so to think that we are the only life out there is ridiculous. it would be a waste of space if we were the only ones. just sayin....

tree. we had just had a quick nasty thunderstorm. i pulled the branch i just cut out of the tree and swung it around and placed it where my pile was going to be. i then turned around to go get another branch and noticed 4 very odd lights i've never seen before on any type of aircraft man made in the southeast sky headed northeast and they were in a box formation or it was one craft. there were no other objects in the sky at that time. it was moving slower than a jet liner and was maybe 10,000 feet high. it had no sound at all and no vap trail. i watched it trying to figure out what type of aircraft it was. i was stumped. the two lights in the front were green, simultaneously pulsing and the other two lights behind them were red and not pulsing. these were larger than normal aircraft lights and brighter. when the two green ones pulsed out, i couldn't see an object. the two green lights seemed to close in together and that's when it made a 90° turn towards the northwest, i was in shock when that happened and then made a 45° turn towards the west. that's when i knew i could run and get my wife and phone and it would still be there. not even 10 seconds later when we came back out it was gone! we could see the sky in all directions and at the speed it was moving it should have still been there. i was covered in goosebumps and my wife said my look on my face was one she had never seen on me before. i wasn't scared at all just in kind of a shock. my wife said she saw a bright flash out the corner of her eye as we came out. i didn't see it and asked her where and she pointed directly where i saw it last. she said it was a quick streaky flash like a meteor going west. about two or three minutes later a jetliner passed over head headed east northeast and it's lights and height were right and it had its sound. i immediately posted on facebook asking if anybody else had seen this. then i came here to you guys. i always believed this stuff could be real but now especially after those instant out of this world g force turns and instantly gone silent actions, i'm a real believer now! any questions feel free to ask. sorry if i jumbled this, i'm still in shock

sightings what so ever, we then towed our camper to goldfield, nevada in hopes of entering the famous haunted goldfield hotel, haunted school and hang out late at night at the haunted cemetery and to stay a week there. one night we were at the cemetery sitting on the hood of my pickup truck facing due west, a little after midnight there suddenly appeared to the south three huge bright blinding  white lights in perfect alignment at a 45 degree angle that came on separately at about 2 seconds apart. my son and i kept asking each other; \"what the [language removed/cms/rjl] is that?!?!? these lights never moved an inch and stayed on for approximately 10 minutes and shut off in sequence as they had come on. during this my son was looking to the west in a pair of 10x50 high powered binoculars when we spotted a triangle of golden lights in the sky for about five minutes that suddenly separated into 3 triangles that were also stationary in the sky over area 51. after the triangles separated into three triangles for about 20 minutes they became one triangle again and formed into a single light for approximately 5 seconds and also shot into the sky like a bullet leaving a rifle barrel. i then noticed what looked like a jet airliner with no blinking lights flying from the north-west flying due south-east over area 51 with its steady blue light that came to an instant stop and changed to a white/golden color that was almost hidden by the stars in the sky but was a slightly different color and never moved for about 25 minutes. all of a sudden this light that was stationary reminded me of a welder with its sparks flying what was being welded in a down ward fashion shot straight up in the sky faster than a bullet leaving a rifle. after all this we seen a light as thou it was an airplane flying in from the north-west, fly directly to the south-east but its flying was extremely erratically, bouncing like from side to side and up and down. all of these strange, strange lights we witnessed lasted about 55 minutes. as suddenly as this light show started, it suddenly ended, no more lights to be seen. we have seen many more lights that moved about in a non traditional flight patterns. i was so glad my son was there to witness these strange lights so i could tell people what i had seen and my son was there so he could say; \"yes we seen ufo's and my dad isn't crazy\"! my son really never was a believer of ufo's or alien's until he witnessed these ufo's with me, he is now a full believer in ufo's and aliens after seeing them for himself. you may call me to ask me more about this event and would be happy to do so, call anytime.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

girlfriend. as it nears our position, it slows and turns east as though it were on rails. we both feel really happy that they've come back to visit. we feel validated from our sightings before, and kind of joyous. a landing plane passes over it's position (2 engine passenger jet). both are in the shot for comparison. the orb heads east & disappears through the clouds. i stop filming. my girlfriend spots orb #2 headed from the same direction as #1. i begin to film again. same flight path. same characteristics. same slowing and course change towards the east, when it reached my position. we waved to it and tried thinking happy thoughts. we both felt an electric charge. goosebumps and the like. orb #3 came from the same direction. same story as the first 2. during it's turn, the light looked like it does when a laser gets shone in your eye (i assume that's exactly what happened). orb #4, came from ssw. under the path of landing planes. once it reached our position, it veered east roboticly/on rails/perfectly. i noticed the air traffic was reduced to small planes, 2 of which moved rapidly from the south, to north east. i assumed that was a fighter interception. for 15 to 20 minutes after that, only small aircraft flew around the downtown core & along the lake shore. after that, the heavy aircraft began landing again.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

smoke resting , i just got home 2 hours ago from work. \r\n\r\ni first noticed the object when i saw a yellow bright orange type orb in the sky. it was very odd to me because i study planes and jets since i am trying to join the canadian forces. \r\n\r\n\r\ni really had no idea what it was, i tried to think of different planes night lights, signal lights and realized most flash on planes for other planes to see it easier and have red and green lights usually on commercial planes and are at the wings , front or back i noticed.After some though,  i then really thought it was a alien ufo from what i witnessed \r\n\r\n\r\ni noticed that it was just hoovering there like nothing i have seeing ever before. after about 3 minutes from what i timed, it started to very slowly mover north west from it position. it moved quite slower then i have seeing in my life. i live very close to the yvr airport also so i regularly observe the air plane speed , trails they leave ect. after only 30 seconds of moving very slow it just stopped dead in its tracks and hoovered some more, after another 5 minutes it started to speed up, not really fast or the speed of a plane but fast enough to travel a block in at least 5 seconds easy, and i mean a good length distance. i then looked at more of the shape and look. i noticed that it was orb circle like, but as if was flat in the seance, imagine drawing a circle on paper and looking at it from the top,but with a circle threw the middle opposite way. it had that type of ring bass, but had a bright glowing orb to it all around. i noticed that the inner part of the orb seemed to be a more thick , dense, orange with a brighter yellowish orange on the outside of it. i quickly ran inside about 2 meters away from where i was. i live on a single level co op in a small place, it took me no more then 5 seconds to reach my computer to look at the time and date. i then ran rite back out side, a total of 10 seconds the most and it just disappeared , not a single trace was left at all.\r\n\r\ni was quite amazed really, i always believed it was ignorant to think god is not from space if religious or that we are the only ones in the universe.During the sighting i was quite like ok, i have to figure this out , what the beep (can put some imagine nation to which swear word i used) is this, this cant be a plane or helicopter, and if it was a helicopter would i not here it?? it left me wondering what was this. i know i am not delusional as  i got my self tested for mentle health and disorders 3 years back just to learn more about my self and do to the fact my mom got psychosis from taking to much medication so it made me do that. i know i was not seeing things so i am left really wanting to figure this out is all i could think.\r\n\r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object by running in to check the date and time. i was to amazed so i forgot to write or type it out. i have memory that is amazing though and can remember things from childhood, at a age most cant.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

sky was clear, no clouds. i was sitting in a window seat of the plane. i like looking out the window, even at night, when i fly. i am not sure which state we were over at the time. the flight was a non eventful flight. no turbulence, no issues. almost boring. most passengers were sleeping or reading. all of a sudden, the pilot made an abrupt upward turn to the left..As if to avoid something. the action brought my attention to the window. after the plane leveled out, i observed a bright red orb/light slowly flying along the side of the plane, going the opposite direction..Going east as we were going west. when it got even with the plane, it matched our speed, as if observing us. i watched this for about 3 to 5 minutes. i looked at the other passengers. no one was phased or even concerned about the pilots abrupt action, nor looked out the window. no one was sitting near me, so no one to ask to look. i also didn't ask anyone because, now i am doubting it is another plane. my first thought was that it was a fighter jet. but, that opinion changed when the object suddenly shot away, to the east still, at an amazing speed. nothing i have ever seen. when we landed, i was going to ask a flight attendant what happened. oddly, no flight attendant was in sight...No one. the cockpit door was closed. there was absolutely no one to ask what happened. i have only told a few people of this event. there was no social media in 2000, like there is today; so there was no way to try to ask anyone else if they had seen this. i am sorry i have no photos. i did not have a camera, and i doubt a camera would have picked up the object. i can only guess at it's size,maybe the size of a car; and the distance, since it was dark, is only a guess also...Maybe 100 yards. i am submitting this in the event that this might be related to anyone else reporting a sighting related to this event. it was a sunday evening in october, i believe one of the last two sundays of the month. i have tried to do some research of any records i may have to pin point the exact sunday and time of this event. i believe we were about half way between minneapolis and great falls. if this is any help, i hope it is. fyi, i really doubt that this was a jet i saw. why would the pilot make an abrupt change in his flight...To the point that every passenger was jostled to a very high degree. everyone looked at each other, but night pout the window. i was on the right side of the plane, meaning the object was on the north side of the plane.","distance":"101-500

about 2 miles distant.  one later was identified as a tower light about 7 miles away.  as i drove ahead, i noticed that one light flared away.  lights were white and about 350 feet apart.  the highway curves here so there was relative motion.  as i neared where i thought the lights might be located, i saw a small fire in the median to my left.  i looked up and saw a very unusual rectangle with bright, horizontal white lighted slats that remained motionless about 50 feet above a pine tree that was easy to remember.  object appeared to be the size of a refrigerator.  i think the sides were covered with 15 to 20 slats on at least three sides.  i do not remember the top and bottom.  all the slats were brightly aglow with a white light.  houses and a few buildings are nearby but none was near the object.\r\n  many cars were headed in the opposite direction.  i drove on as i had a passenger.  passenger was too low to see the object.  the next day, i stopped and examined the fire with a bit of hesitation because of the possible dangers of what could have started the fire.  the fire was about as big as two king sized beds.  there were some two foot pieces of logs in the fire area that had come off the numerous log trucks but, otherwise the fire location was normal for burnt grass.\r\n  i am 100% certain that the object was not again at the first location as nothing was located there on numerous other trips day or night.\r\n  someone could have had an object in the sky but, i doubt that to be the case.  i would have to call it unidentified by me.  i was not able to generate much interest in the few people i told of the light and so, i just let the event go for at least three months until i found the web site for reports here.  if the object was a drone, the size was very large.  i do not think the object was tethered either. i saw no means of motion.  i did not see it move up close.  i heard nothing because i was in a closed car on a cold night.","distance":"101-500

about a kilometer from the lake,i had to pass my other friends camp where i was going ice fishing,i was about 100-150 meters off shore,where i decided to drill the holes in the ice,with my gas powered ice auger,i drilled 2 holes and was baiting the lines when i heard this low whistling sound it wasn't a steady whistle but on and off,ithought it might have been the wind whistling through the eye on the fishing rod,so i put my ear closeto the eye on the rod but didn't appear to be coning from that,so i looked at my buddys camp on shore to see if there was anything there that would make the whistling noise,just a weather vane and a venmar on the roof,but i been there hundreds of times and never heard that noise before,the whistle stopped and another weird noise started,sounded like something you would hear in an old spooky movie,i started laughing and went on to drill a couple more holes in the ice,this time the noise sounded like the one on crocidile dundee,where he twirles that thing over his head,i started laughing again wondering whwere all this weird noise was coming from,than the whistling started again,so again i put my ear down by the eye on the fishing rod to see if it was coming from it,than there was this high pitched sound,i instantly put my hands over my ears to block the noise but it didn;t seem to do much good just like the noise was coming right through my head,i fell on my knees and sarted to black out,and was falling face first onto the ice,than the noise quit,seemed like it only lasted a few seconds,but that was enough,i got up looked around,checked mt watch for lost time,than headed to my friends camp a kilometer awaywhen i got there he was inside i asked if he had heard anything ,he started laughing,he said he heard the weird noise also but said he didn't hear the high pitched sound;said he must have been inside the camp,i said if the army had anything like that ,they could drop their enemies in their tracks,i tryed to get
