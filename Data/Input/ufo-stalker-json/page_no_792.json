hour or 25 mints we noticed a star like light much brighter and bigger getting closer to us slowly. we thought its a plane or something and didnt paid attention to it. the light keep coming closer and it got that closed that we can see its shape. it was diamond like object and it was not a human made craft. we were shocked to see it. it was glowing white and arround it different light were blinking like red blue orange yellow. we were so excited as my friend said hey let me make a video of this and he took out his phone. as he took out his phone it went dead like battery was sucked dry. the light come closer and closer and right after few seconds it was only 20 to 30 feet above us. my friends were in panik and shacking due to fear i was also very shocked.As we are thinking how to get rid

yesterday late afternoon while bank fishing along the monongahela river in charleroi, pa. it was sunny, with a few clouds. i had my line in the water and was looking in the sky, watching out for a possible pop up thunderstorm. i had my sunglasses on and spotted a dark sphere coasting along in the sky in front of us. it moved closer to our position and appeared to slow down. i got my boyfriend josh’s attention on it. at first he couldn’t see it because it was way up there and the bright sun made it hard to focus on it. he did see it and we watched it. i got a better look with my sunglasses on. it was an acorn shaped dark black object, however one area seemed to be flashing a red light on the left middle part of it. there was nothing reflective on this object. it definitely was not a mylar balloon. this object was much larger than a small balloon. if i had to guess, i’d say it was approx. half the size of a volkswagon bug car. this object did not move with the wind, it moved against it and hovered for 2-3 minutes. while watching this, i was stunned to see an identical object fly into sight right a few feet above the one we were already watching. it was the exact same dark black acorn shaped object that did not reflect the sun. this object had a blue flashing light in the same spot on it, as the other one. both objects hovered for 4-5 minutes, then slowly moved away from us. i kept questioning what it was that we saw. i was perplexed that these objects did not reflect the sunlight. \r\n\twe went about our day and arrived home later that evening. that night, my boyfriend had a hard time sleeping. he had a stomach ache, probably from something he ate earlier. he did seem anxious last night. i remember he woke me up in the middle of the night asking me if i had heard “that knocking”. i did not hear the knocking he heard. after he woke me up, he went upstairs to check on it. he heard nothing while checking throughout the house. he came back and described the repetitious strange knocking sound he heard. i just chalked it up to maybe he was mistakenly hearing someone knocking on a neighbors door. we both went back to sleep. about an hour later he woke me up again to tell me our 11 year old daughter was at the top of the stairs calling me. i got up and walked to the bottom of the stairs and asked her what was wrong. she said she was scared, that she saw a face in her room. she wasn’t overly scared, so it didn’t alarm me. i assumed she just had a bad dream and i told her to go back to bed. she hesitated but did. she also slept with her light on in her room the rest of the night. then around sunrise i was awakened by a loud noise of dishes sliding around in the kitchen sink upstairs. i didn’t really feel alerted ,as that kind of thing has happened before.\r\nduring breakfast, my daughter told me what happened during the night that scared her. she said something woke her up and she opened her eyes to a startling sight of face right up in her face. maybe 1-2 inches away. she said it had white skin and was a slight human shape to it. she drew a picture of it and it to me, it looked like a hybrid. she made the eye pupils dark and bigger than the average humans. she said it was just staring at her. she said she couldn’t tell if it was male or female and didn’t see any hair. just the face. she said she closed her eyes and opened them up a few seconds later and it was still there. she said then the face slowly faded away.\r\n\r\nit didn’t occur to me that this all could be connected until late this morning. i felt it was important to report this and document it. i plan on setting up my camcorder tonight to see if i can catch anything in the house. i have to try.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

fireworks so i waited for the fizzle or pop that would surely follow, but it was completely silent, which immediately struck me as odd. the only thing i could compare what i saw was similar to a shooting star, but it did not just fizzle out the way meteorites and, and this was much too close to be a meteorite. if it was a shooting star, than it was huge, which is why i just assumed it was close....Like a firework. it came from the east and travelled west and it crossed the skyline in about five seconds. since it was gone, i didn't think anything else of it. approximately five minutes later, the street lights started going off one by one, sequentially, from east to west, following the same path of the orb that just wizzed by. the lights remained off for about thirty seconds and

shining in a very clear sky with no clouds at all. i have had dozens of ufo sightings in my life so i make it a habit to scan the sky whenever i am outside in the hope that i will add another sighting to my already miraculous mental library of technologically advanced craft, whether human in origin or other-worldly in nature. i was looking straight up and i noticed a 'flash' of light moving from the north to the south in the sky. the light appeared to be emanating from the top of the craft and did not flash in any sequence whatsoever, just a random flash every now and again. i did not observe any 'normal' green or red flashing lights or strobes as is required in normal aviation rules nor did i see any white strobe light(s) on this craft either, just the random flash of the dome light on top of the circular craft. there was an almost invisible violet haze surrounding the craft which solidified my suspicion that this was not any normal craft that i am aware of - but i also know that humans have reverse-engineered ufo's for decades now and i have no doubt that someone on this planet probably has a fleet of human-piloted anti-gravitic craft flying around that we are not privy to. as i stated earlier, the craft was heading south and flashing randomly when it stopped mid-flight and hovered for a brief moment and then reversed it's heading to a northern heading and traversed about a mile (estimated) and suddenly disappeared altogether in a flash of bright light ! i did not hear any sound coming from the craft either despite it being so quiet outside at 3 am. i continued scanning the sky for other craft that don't fit the normal mode of known aircraft but finally gave up after about 10 minutes and went back inside to bed. whenever i have a sighting of any kind, i always reach out to the craft with my mind and thank whoever is flying the craft for allowing me to see them so clearly and i always wish them well with the hope and promise that so many of us on this planet are ready for a face-to-face encounter with them, but that we are being held back in ignorance by our own lying government officials that refuse to enlighten us with their knowledge of ufo's and hidden meetings between humans and our space-faring brethren. perhaps one day soon *crossing fingers* our visiting space friends will just show themselves to the planet in a way that can no longer be denied and help us to regain control of this devastated living planet and reverse the horrible damage we have done by sharing openly with us the technology and spirituality needed to move forward as a whole species and start to learn about all of the other amazing life that is teeming all around us in this universe. i continue to look to the sky and perhaps one day i will be lucky enough to meet them, but until then i will keep studying the unknown and try my best to be a better steward to this planet and my fellow humans. thank you mufon for being available to us folks and allowing us to share our information with each other - this is such an important subject of investigation and adds to the proof that this is all very real !

was walking through the kitchen as i checked the doors and windows before bed. as i checking the patio door, i looked up and saw a bright orange glow. it was 11:55pm, on sunday may the 17th, 2015. i yelled to the wife to come and take a look, and went back to the kitchen to look from a different window. it was too big to be a plane, and too slow. it reminded me of an orange led christmas bulb glowing at night. i watched as the orange glow slowly, very slowly, moved from my left side slowly across the sky. i didnt want to take my eyes off it but i needed to get it on video so i ran at got my cell phone. i ran outside into the backyard, the wife joined me, and we watched as it continued across the sky in an arc, it reminded me of a time lapsed moom setting. as it started to slip from view, it dimmed and the orange colour disappeared. the entire thing lasted 5 minutes tops. it disappeared from view behind my neighbours trees.\r\n\r\nso here i am, 30 mins later in bed, unable to
