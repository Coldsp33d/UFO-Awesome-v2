looking up at the sky for a moment.  it is may 17, 2015.  i was going to look away but for some reason a cloud formation caught my eye, just looked a little odd somehow.  it wasn't shaped in any form recognizable like a face or anything but still held my interest.  i then realized that the front of the longer thicker line of clouds was a more solid cloud and that at first thought maybe it was the stream from an airplane but the stream behind it looked way too thick for that.\r\n\r\ni watched the front of the 'cloud' with my binoculars and that confirmed that the front in fact was much denser and solid looking and in fact looked a bit like an oval but still most of it was covered in misty cloud so can't be fure of the shape.\r\n\r\ni watched the front of it as it passed from nw to almost due west when all of a sudden a jet came screaming in the same path where the 'cloud' had been and in the same direction towards it.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was just a coincidence but when i picked up the binoculars again to look at the 'cloud' front i saw that the plane's residue line in fact was parallel with that of the 'cloud' and not far from it either.  that looked too strange to be a coincidence.  the positioning screamed that it was in fact chasing the 'cloud'.\r\n\r\nthen after the plane disappeared from site to the west i realized that the 'cloud' had formed the letter z in the sky which means it went in those directions to form that letter and not only that but i was stunned when the z plainly stayed in the same position in the sky in the west for over 3/4 of an hour.  i have never seen a formation of clouds lasting more than a couple of minutes if that but this pattern was sticking.  very strange indeed.\r\n\r\nthe sky is mostly blue today and the weather is still and warm.  there are wispy clouds here and there but many are lower to the horizon whereas this 'cloud' formation was much much higher up which also made it stand out.\r\n\r\nusually i don't pay much attention to clouds but have seen pictures by people who say there are ufos in the pictures of clouds but i find most of them a stretch however this sighting was very unusual, moved unlike any flying vehicle i know of and the vapour as i said lasts much longer than the usual clouds we all have seen.\r\n\r\nat first i thought the object was the trail of a jet but the trail was way too thick for that as the front was moving in a slow but deliberate path and the front was more solid as i said.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the object i was still thinking it might be a plane trail or just an odd cloud but couldn't take my eyes off it.  it was then i realized it was moving and not like a cloud but like the tail was being led by the oval solid object at th front of it - attached it seemed.  there was no color i could see just cloud like.  i wasn't afraid or anything but definitely amazed because as i said i have never really bought into cloud like ufos but will pay more attention from now on.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object when it went around the backside of my home and i wasn't able to get out to follow it further.  actually i think it still hung in the letter z near the bottom

of the setting sun approximately at dusk looking across an open flat field.  my wife and i both caught the silhouette of an opaque rectangular object against the sun.  the object's ratio was approximately twice as long as it was tall or high.  at first, we thought it was an airplane or blimp. we live close to the air force base that commonly has c-5 gallaxy cargo planes traveling to the west.  we have never seen a blimp in this area, but from the size of the object, a blimp at the right distance could have been large enough, although not the right shape.  this was far more angular than a classic blimp shape.  the fact that it completely blocked out the sun and while observing it, did not appear to be moving at all with respect to the sun.  we expected to see its position change with respect to the sun, but for the twenty minutes, or so, that we observed it, that never happened.  its appearent size did not increase or decrease with time either as you would expect with an object such as an airplane that is either directly receeding from or heading streight at you.  the object's appearent size was approximately the size of a tic-tac held 12-18\" in front of your face, buit more rectangular than rounded and as stated previously, was completely black against the sun without any indication of lights, wings, fins, langing gear, engines, or any other common aerospace vehicle features.  the object's position with respect to the sun was centrally located with a slight position to the east north-east quadrant of the sun.  during observation, its position against the sun did not change even as the sun was setting.  \r\nmy wife suggested that we travel to a different road to get a better view.  we got back in the car and moved about five miles and got out and observed it again as having the same relative size, shape and orientaiton with respect to the sun.  the sun was approximately 5 degrees over the horizon and i was now convinced that this was not a normal sight.  i tried to get a picture fo the object with the phone's camera, but couldn't get the camera to focus on the object against the sun.  i'm nit sure if the camera lens was smudged or wasn't able to resolve the image against the direct sun.  within thirty seconds, the sun had fully dropped below the horizon and the object was not longer visible.  i now regret not having taken a video or a picture.  \r\nin my opinion, i do not think the object was in the earth's atmosphere.  if it was, its motion would to have been such that its appearent size did not change for twenty minutes and was moving in such a way to stay perfectly synchronized with the position of the sun from our vantage point.  i believe that it was an extremely large object closer to the sun than the earth.  i do not believe that this could have possibly been an airplane.  i would be very interested to know if anyone else had observed the object and thier estimation of the size, shape, motion, and position.  a secondary viewpoint would help to identify the size and distance via triangulation and verify what we observed.  this was a very unusual object.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

firing upon one another. over the last few years i have observed that the unfriendly or those who want something that the local objects have are usually appear dark or dimly lit. it makes it easier to tell the good guys from the bad. the local objects that i have been in reqular contact with are usually brightly lit and easy to see. they make no bones about their presence in our area. there is a large deposit of u-238 or uranium underground here in barry county. it is well known that the ufo's seem to crave this element and the local friendly bunch seems to have gotten here first and they have staked their claim on it before other apposing groups could somewhere around the beginning of the civil war. they reach this uranium by means of a series of caves and tunnels, one of which thanks to an exaction for a new water main, i found runs near my house, they accidently broke through it digging up the ground for the new water main or i would be a doubter myself if i had not seen it for myself. the tunnels were used during the civil war for a field hospital and an ammo dump by the south. this is why i have the date set for some time around the civil war. this is in the local historical records. how long before that is unknown as the length of time of the tunnels exisitance. there appears to a ongoing battle for the uranium but here lately they have exculpated their battle for control for some reasons. mu dog pointed toward the ne sky last night but there was no visable objects in that part of the sky, but the sky was completely overcast with clouds and we did have some minor damage from what i assume to be a f-0 or f-l tornado or funnel cloud, uprooted small trees and some small trees split in half which fits that type of tornado it happened around 1 am. mot sure if the ufo's were in vovoled the damage or not/ mo proof. i am not sure what this maybe leading up to if it keeps on going they way it is now going and exculationg.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

i heard coyotes howling abnormally loud over the sound of the tv.  i walked outside to investigate and noticed 6 bright white lights flashing simultaneously about 2 miles to the southeast.  they were in a straight line and appeared to be about 1000 feet above the ground.  i first assumed that they were just a group of c-130 aircraft, from a nearby air force base, on night maneuvers, which is not uncommon.  after observing them for several seconds, i realized that i could not hear their familiar sound and then i noticed that the white strobe lights were flashing simultaneously instead of individually.  after several minutes of watching these lights to see if they would get out of flash sequence, they never did, and i also noticed that they never changed position the entire time, as if just hovering.  after several minutes, of observing these 6 strobe lights, a very bright spot light shined on me from directly over head.  i was unable to ascertain the elevation of this light due to its intensity, but i estimated its elevation at 100 to 200 feet.  there was absolutely no sound at all.  i did not have a clue as to what this object was and still don't.  the light was bright enough to see the ground around me on a very dark night.  this spot light shined on me for about one full minute and i was so mesmerized that i could not look away.  after a minute the spot light turned off and as the light was dimming, the object started moving very slowly to the south.  i really never saw a structured object due to the intensity of the spot light.  the event was suddenly over and i

the night in the walhalla hotel with my father in the little hamlet of walhalla in a deep forested valley in eastern victoria.  walhalla is an old mining town, and 'slag' heaps could still be seen on parts of the valley sides then. at that time - and until only recently in fact - the town had  no main grid power supply and all buildings including the hotel had their own generators (the hotel's generator was switched off at about 10.30pm and back on again early in the morning).  this meant that if you were close to the hotel, you could hear the generator hum in the background.\r\n\r\nbeing summer, when we came out of the hotel at about 10.30 - 11 am, it was a very bright day with no clouds, so there was nothing to obscure the view of the sky.  we noticed a fellow a short way down the street looking straight up into the sky, and we walked up to him to see what he was looking at. somehow, he'd noticed a small black triangular object at a height of perhaps 2000 feet sitting dead still in the sky.  i can recall when i looked up at it that it was a perfect black isoceles triangle with no apparent wings or any other extensions.  after a few minutes, more people walked up and joined our group - someone had some binoculars and i was able to borrow them to look at it.  strangely, it didn't seem to be any closer when i looked at it through the binoculars and this was also something my father had mentioned.\r\n\r\nafter about perhaps ten or fifteen minutes, i experienced a strong wave of fatigue, and i closed my eyes for a few minutes.  this was not entirely unusual, as i've been sensitive to very bright light, but when i opened my eyes, two things had occurred.  firstly, the object - which was still sitting dead still in the sky - had seemingly moved a bit higher, and secondly the light seemed to be slightly different. my father walked away for a few minutes and when he came back, he told me that his watch was wrong - that the time was now about 1pm.  he said it had never done that before and couldn't understand why. \r\n\r\ni didn't realise the significance of this until i spoke to someone who had seen a really large ufo over bentleigh - another melbourne suburb - in about 1973.  he told me that even though he was only watching it for about twenty minutes, about an hour and a half had passed. my recollection regarding the light was that it was different because it was slightly later in the day and the sun had moved across the sky.  perhaps my father's watch was right after all...  were we missing about two hours?  was this because we were in the intensified gravity field of an advanced spacecraft and that the time in our immediate position had slowed down relative to normal time? \r\n\r\ncould the black object have been a kite?  if it was, the only reason it could have remained still for so long was if someone had stretched lines across from one ridge to the next - hardly likely.  there is one other possibility.  not far to the east is sale raaf air base.  could they have been involved in testing some sort of highly classfiied aircraft?\r\n\r\n might add that as far as i know, my father's watch was an enicar - he bought a couple on ships on his travels.  from what i've read, they tend to be quite reliable.  as he bought it in the early 1960's, i'd say the likelyhood of it being a fake was not that likely, but as said in the story, it had never done that before.\r\n\r\nas far as i can recall, we watched the object until we decided to leave - i think it was still there.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was around midnight when i was taking my dogs outside with a friend. i was staring at the stars. i could see a couple of planes in the horizon flying low, either descending or ascending with lights over the wings and in the front. i noticed two air crafts flying side by side with some space between them over my head. they were high above the commercial planes. they were silent. i saw them dangerously weaving in and out towards each other as though they were having fun in the air or space flying. i never saw them touch each other. they flew in the same direction moving straight. my friend couldn't see them without glasses. i kept my eyes on the two aircraft wondering why are they flying without lights on. they were out of my view within two minutes. they moved very quickly. i did not see wings on the air craft. i only saw the body of the air craft which was cylinder like two slim bullets in the sky. 110% they were air craft. they moved swiftly a part and then very close to each other still without touching. i either saw two ufo air crafts or two government jets flying much much higher than the commercial planes. i saw a plane after the two air crafts were gone. the plane was much lower, slower, and it had lights blinking on visible wings. these aircrafts were not commercial planes. i'm not sure if anyone else saw these two air crafts in june/july 2011 at night.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

triangular formation hovering through low hanging clouds.  they were huge, in perfect geometric formation, and were very bright.  i lived in rural missouri so the road was just a smooth surface along a stretch of homes.  i slowed down and rolled down my window but heard nothing.  perplexed, i pulled over to the small patch of road that passed for a shoulder and turned off my car.  i got out and stared at the three large lights that held position in the clouds.  i looked around, saw the lights of the school football field in the distance, and also noticed two other people had pulled over to examine the lights.  we gave each other half shrugs, and that’s when i realized i was looking at something i couldn’t identify.  i’d never seen these hovering lights before and the lack of noise, like an engine, scared the hell out of me.  so i got back in my car and drove home as fast as i could.","distance":"101-500
