spring a/c maintenance. i was taking a break & laying on my back on the roof looking up at the sky. as i was looking up i noticed movement coming from the east. i thought it was a. plane flying  over head. except this craft was moving across the sky way to fast to be anything man made. when i saw how fast it was moving i stood up. as i was observing the craft i was looking at it at a 45-55 degree angle. the craft was moving east to west across the sky. it appeared to be 30,000-40,000 ft in the air. about cruise altitude where a airplane would fly.  normally when you see a plane fly at cruise altitude across the sky the plane appears to barely move across the sky. this craft was moving 5 times faster than a military jet or anything i've ever seen in the sky.  it was a metallic grey disc shaped craft.  i followed the craft moving from the east to the west until i lost it in the sun.  it made no sound at all.  i plane watch at my house all the time & most planes at cruise altitude can still be heard from the ground.  this thing was so quiet it was eery.  i am a christian, so i immediately started to pray for protection from these demonic beings.  i read your website stating you are trying to figure out these ufo's & who is piloting them.  i know what they are & they are not aliens.  that is what they want everyone to think.  so, they can continue abducting people & continue their ancient hybridization program creating the nephilim.  half human, half fallen angels.  they use these crafts to travel in & out of the deminsions, because they lost their heavenly bodies when they sinned against god.  the bible speaks about them in many books.  they have you all fooled, & when they reveal their true identities it will be to late.  they can appear & disappear.  they can defy the laws of physics.  because, they are fallen angels & they have powers that are \"alien\" to us.  but, they are not aliens from another planet.  mystery solved!  i know i'm some bible thumping nut.  well this nut could probably take your intel from your investigations & connect it to these fallen angels.  i have studied these beings for along time, & they are highly intelligent.  smarter than you or i.  they can read our thoughts, communicate telepathically, move through solid objects, defy gravity, disappear in a blink of an eye, & can appear as an angel of light. a light so intense it burns your eyes.  the bible speaks about that.  but, you all will never come out & admit to the truth.  because, y'all would be ridiculed by satan's media.  it's easier to believe a lie.  the truth has consequences.  one day you will have to make a choice to side with the liar or to accept the truth in christ.  for me it was pretty easy.  good luck chasing after satan's angels.  they will always be one step ahead unless you all accept the truth & even the playing field.  they have a weakness it's jesus christ.  the name above all names & even the fallen angels have abide by his name. that's my sighting & the truth about these demonic beings you all call ufo's & aliens.  it's hilarious to listen to so called experts call them aliens.  expert in what?  spreading more lies for satan.  be careful chasing after satan's angels.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line

entered the left turning lane leading to greenfield heights. clear night, sparse traffic. waiting for green left turn light. it was here while waiting that we made an unusual observation. coming up from the distant east tree line (about 1/2 mile away) at approx 45 degree slope a light leading a large lumbering black shape appeared and headed in our general direction (slightly north westerly). it moved gentle, blimpish, quietly  slowly leveling out as it headed west, at one point it was almost directly above us (slightly north) and we were mesmerized by the length, which was primarily evidenced by the long dark gap between a front large almost led type light on a slightly cone shaped tip to the back with a couple of pattern pulsating red lights (no green, blue or other lights) i rolled down my window and we stared as it continued west toward the north/west forest tree line, in an oddly (low low altitude for such a size) until out of sight. most unusual was its floating type of movement, it's size and very dark exterior, and a very conspicuous lack of sound.\r\n\r\nwe have lived next to mcas cherry point nearly 20 years. my spouse (now retired) was involved in land air defense on the air station. we can identify numerous aircraft by sight, shadow, sound and movement patterns. we frequently hear flights in and out of cherry point air station including vertical lift helos and of course the harrier jets that can \"hover.\" \r\n\r\nthis object was not identifiable to anything previously experienced. it was much larger than known typical military craft, including the c-130. it moved almost like a blimp but was not the large football/blimp shape, more like a long very dark (almost matching the night sky) cigar. the lights initially lead us to believe it was a known craft coming past at an odd angle, but as it leveled out and continued west, it was apparent this was not a known craft, at least not known to me. the lack of sound was particularly fascinating.\r\n\r\ni know that sound travels slower than light. whenever we happen to view a helo or other craft at a similar range it takes a moment for the sound to catch up to the viewed object but ultimately it does and we always hear the typical aircraft roars and rumbles. \r\n\r\nas this strange object passed overhead, we listened specifically for any sound patterns. there were none. the object just passed by at quick and steady pace until it was no longer visible. \r\n\r\nwe (son and i) both agreed we could not identify this craft so we considered it a ufo.\r\n\r\ni was reluctant to share this on mufon, however, i would have appreciated it if i found someone describing something similar that they also experienced and so, in the interest of sharing, here it is. if anyone ask, i'll try drawing it out and post the sketch.\r\n\r\naside from missing our left turn and feeling a bit paranoid, we have experienced no negative side effects.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

(2) did the pilot in fact see what i saw, but didn't make a report ? (3) did the pilot make a report, but the faa would not confirm my sighting with his ? \r\n\r\n if you investigate this sighting and uncover some information that corroborates my report i hope you will be so kind as to let me know, and if you would be interested in learning about my first sighting in 79 please feel free to contact me. the main difference in that one being even though i was the only one to actually see the object three other people saw the light from it that filled the interior of my car \" because they were sitting in it \" and heard the noise \" three distinct and different sounds \" it made as it passed overhead at a very high rate of speed. i watched as it went from horizon to horizon following the curvature of the earth.\r\n\r\nsincerely\r\n\r\nname removed/cak\r\n\r\n    ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":65573,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.9393925,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05162015-0087","longitude":-85.8460454,"occurred":1320119100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1431841681000,"summary":"I watched as it approached from the west, slow to hover, change direction to s.S.E., then disappear @ 45* to the s. !!!","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1293,"locationName":"Fortville, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:35523"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed, Treetop","city":"Lisbon","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting on my patio and noticed the orange orb in the north. i then saw another orange orb right next to it, and then more and more appeared.  i alerted my husband and we moved outside into the street to have an unobstructed view of the sky north of town.  we watched for 8 minutes, and saw multiple formations of orange orbs moving from west to east.  several turned white and dropped down as if they were landing, but that is just conjecture, as they were out of sight.\r\n   the objects just blinked out of sight after traveling east.   we were quite intrigued.  this was an unusual event.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":65571,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.76608562818081,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05162015-0085","longitude":-80.79209252304125,"occurred":1431836400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1431839167000,"summary":"Saw between 20 and 30 orange orbs flying in formation north of lisbon ohio.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"Ohio","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Lisbon, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:35524"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Roseburg","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving from seattle to ashland oregon along i-5 with my brother's family about 10 years ago we were in oregon going through one of the first mountain passes somewhere south of cottage grove, but not quite to roseburg.  after hours of keeping my eyes on the road, i suddenly looked up and to my left, for no apparent reason, to see a tiny imperceptibly small black dot coming right for my nose.  i said \"what is that?\" and pointed my left index finger into the top left corner of the windshield against the glass.  at that precise instant the windshield shattered slightly precisely where i was touching the glass.  my brother and his wife said that was weird, and we continued on with our drive. meteor?

watching the jets (looking northwest at the horizon) take off from the airport in the distance.The airport is about 12-14 miles away (as the crow flies) from where i was standing. the triangular shaped object caught my eye above and to the left of the direction i was looking. i thought it was an aircraft at first, but it had no flashing lights like the jets i was watching did. it came from the north (my right) moving slow, and with no sound moved to the south.I estimate it was about 500 feet above me on an angle. it was thick, big, dark, and had 5 to 7 pulsating amber color lights (in a row) on the back of the triangle. it also had smaller, dimmer lights of some kind on the bottom/sides that were not flashing, but i was focused more on the back end of it. i noticed these lights as it passed me, just to the west/southwest. at this point, i estimate that it traveled 20 miles to the south in about 8 to 10 seconds, almost like it was speeding up as it got farther away from me. just as it was fading away in the distance i saw it do a 90 degree turn, and like it was in warp speed it disappeared to the east over the mountains. at this point i was in an awe state of mind and something told me not to say anything about what i saw. like it sent me a message to just forget about it. i went back down the steps off the roof and into my parents apartment with no urge to tell my parents or my sisters that were there. the next day i did end up telling my parents. they laughed at me first, but then proceeded to tell me that mexicans in the area have seen other ufo type objects. your program convinced me to report this sighting and i did see an episode that had a very similar type craft in it. thank you and i hope this helps with your investigations.
