was sitting on the porch.  it was a block/band of light that came out of the sky.  the light reached up into the sky into perpetuity. i could not see anything creating the beam but it was coming from a great distance.  the light was a rectangle like band.  it had edges to it and it lit up what it was landing on but it did not have any \"overflow\".  meaning it did not put off any additional light in the area, the light was \"solid\".  it only lit up exactly what it was on and it was completely dark outside of the edges of the light. the beam suddenly appeared across the street on top of a house and went straight up into what seemed like to space.  it moved across the top of house onto the driveway, then onto the street. it moved at quick right angles as if it were a spot light but like i said it was rectangular, solid and it had distinct edges. it moved across the street, into the neighbors trees.  it moved onto my deck about 6 -8 feet away. it was there for about 2 seconds and then moved onto the top of my roof.  once it moved onto my roof, i stood up and moved to the other side of the porch so i could see it on the roof.  it stayed illuminated for a few seconds and then just turned off.  i sat back down wondering what i had just seen.  all of the sudden i realized that it was brighter on my deck than it should be.  i looked down and i could see lite and shadows moving around on my porch around and under the chair next to me.  i looked under the chair and there was a lite that was spinning. it was about 1 1/2 feet tall and 6 -7 inches wide and it was like a cylindrical tin candle lantern but it was not solid, it was just a soft lite that was emanating a pattern like what a tin candle lantern would cast. it rotated slowly.  i looked at it for a few - 10 second not really believing my eyes. suddenly i realized that i was actually seeing what i was seeing and it was really there.  i suddenly began to feel a very intense feeling of fear.  i went into the house, locked the door and went in and wrote down in my journal exactly what i had seen so i would not forget it.  my first reasonable thought was that i was seeing a reflection off of satellite, but the light was not a normal type of light beam.  and then there was the spinning light on my porch.  has anyone ever reported something like this?","distance":"20 Feet or

this event i had thought to myself how it would be cool to have another ufo sighting as i had seen a sighting in years.I got my phone out was taking pictures of the dogs and the rivers to post on my facebook i took a picture of the sun to see what my camera would do.After looking at the pictures to post on facebook i noticed that there was another object besides the sun picture.It was easy to see as the first picture turned out kind of dark.And the next picture you can see that the object at about 10 o'clock from the sun had moved a little bit higher in the sky into the cloud.These first two photos were taken last week maybe midweek.I've been waiting since then for a nice clear day to take more photos of the sun to see if there would be anything there.On my way home from work on the 15th.I stop by the grocery to get some stuff for dinner.The sun was directly in front of me with a clear sky as i exited the car i pointed the camera at the sun and took 3 photos seconds apart.Examining the photos on the 16th the first photo there was nothing there.The second photo you can see the object just next to the pointy cloud on the right at about 2 o'clock from the sun.In the third photo the object is left of the sun at about the 10 o'clock position.It still has an aura.Just before leaving the car to take the pictures and going to the grocery store i said to myself and to the object that may be there that i wish it was there so i could get more pictures of it and share with the public.It almost seems like it heard me asking requesting it to be there as it moved in after my second photo and third photo. which i thought was pretty cool. this object could not be seen with the naked eye as the sun light will blind you looking towards the sun it was only visible to the camera in the photos.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

to 7 round glowing lights in the very dark sky above us on one side of the highway. the lights were traveling in a se direction and continued to do that for the duration of the sighting. since our car continued in a se direction, i concluded that the lights must be as well, since we would have passed them if they had not also been moving.\r\n\r\nthe lights were round, with irregular edges and glowing a bright white. we observed them for about 15 minutes before they all disappeared at the same time. they didn't fly off, they just disappeared instantly at the same time. we did not know if they were one large object or a configuration of smaller objects. i describe it as a boomerang shape, but if it was one large object then it could have been banking or switching lights off and on to create the illusion of a boomerang shape.\r\n\r\nthe configuration changed about 3 times by having a light disappear from the longer arm of the boomerang and instantly appear on the shorter arm. in the blink of an eye, the longer arm became shorter while simultaneously the shorter arm became one light longer than before.\r\n\r\nwe heard no sound, smelled nothing, or saw or heard any plane or helicopter etc. during or after the sighting. it did not land, change direction or have any discernible characteristics other than the white glowing light shapes in a boomerang configuration.\r\n\r\nupon first sighting the lights, i checked my rearview mirror, had my companion roll down her window closest to the lights and made all efforts to rule out reflections from highway lights or anything common that would account for the lights appearing to be in the sky above us. there were no variables to account for this sighting.\r\n\r\ni wanted to stop but my companion was extremely afraid and trembling so i kept driving at a slower speed while observing the lights. my companion readily acknowledged seeing the lights but did not want to talk about it at the time or later. years later, when i asked her if she remembered what we saw, she said yes and described the lights with no prompting, but still did not want to discuss it. \r\n\r\nmy reaction was not fear but amazement, as i'd never seen or even heard of anything to account for what we were seeing. in my excitement, i did jokingly ask my companion if we stopped, would she want to contact whatever it was in the sky. she become very agitated and alarmed and loudly said, no--so i assured her that wouldn't happen and that i was just joking. she said it was not funny and she wanted to get away from the lights. she remained tense and nervous and i remained amazed even after they disappeared.\r\n\r\nto my knowledge, nothing has happened to either of us, in the intervening years since the sighting, that seems connected to it.\r\n\r\nnote: unable to submit report until i clicked on landing material as \"unknown\" and landing soil/vegetation as \"unknown\" when i had previously said that there was

bag to the main trash can in the front of my dad's house. after closing the lid, i turned and noticed 3 glowing lights moving slowly above the neighbors tree line but below the clouds. i listened for noise, but heard nothing. i knew that if they were helicopters or planes that they would have a red and/or green light on them. there were no red or green lights on any of them. they weren't flares either because they remained at the same altitude for the duration of the sightings. about a minute after this, 3 more lights appear from behind the trees. they were pretty much in a line with some of them fairly close to each other. this is when i knew i had to get my brother to get his opinion. i felt sure that i was observing ufos. i never took my eyes off them. i knocked on his bedroom window and returned to where i was standing when i first saw these orbs. when he came outside all i did was point in the direction of the lights. by this time several more lights appeared, all coming out of the southeast and moving to the northeast. there was a slight curve in their forward movement. at one point 4 of these orbs were fairly close together. we discussed that we would have heard something because they were close to each other. absolutely no sound came from any of them. this lasted for approximately 20 minutes. i also took photos with my cell phone. \r\n\r\nafter the last one was no longer in sight, i called the local police department to find out if they had received any calls from anyone else that might have seen them. the dispatcher stated no calls had been received. she asked for my name and address, which i gave to her. i also told her that i had taken photos of the lights. she asked if i wanted an officer to come out and talk to us and see the photos. i said sure. we ended the call. 20 minutes later my cell phone rang. it was a police officer informing me that they did in fact get a couple of phone calls from individuals that saw the lights. he then stated that the lights were helicopters going out to the gulf of mexico for oil rig crew changes. wrong!!! first of all, the orbs were traveling to the northeast. the gulf of mexico is to the south. secondly, petroleum helicopters inc.(phi) does not send 20+ helicopters at a time for crew changes. i know this because my brother worked for phi. if they would have been helicopters they would not have flown in the pattern that we observed. and with that many of them we would have heard them. i didn't want to argue with this policeman. he insulted me and that was wrong of him to say what he said. his ending words to me were 'no policeman will be sent out to talk to us or to see the photos.' my feelings about this are excitement. i never felt frightened. actually, i would have totally loved it if they would have landed near me. i never miss your programs and feel that you have given me the knowledge to know the difference between aircraft from this planet and aircraft from another world.\r\n\r\ni know that the attached photos are not the best. but i have seen in your programs that you can do amazing things to enlarge the objects involved.\r\n\r\nthank you for your programs and having this website to report sightings. i would gladly discuss this further with you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

many brilliant shooting stars the evening we were hungry to go out and gaze to the heavens again and had already made five or six trips outside. as we sat we both observed what appeared to be huge meteor traveling at the highest rate of speed i have ever seen. i estimate 5 to 10 times the speed of sound. i got the feeling the object was spinning like a top i was in the army airborne infantry i estimate the length of the object to be 400m - 700m long and 300 - 450m wide or tall. it was a fat disk in shape dark in color the object left two distinct trails of orange flame as it tore through the atmosphere angular /==== starting from the leading edge of the top edge 150m tall trailing 1700m and dissipating into nothing an equal and opposite trail \\==== that started from the leading edge of the bottom of the meteor in tandem. vividly i recall that their was no trail whatsoever directly behind the object as it hurtled past only blackness which still to me makes no sense. in awe and shock moments maybe 45 seconds we stood is dumbfounded silence finally i swallowed and asked my x, \"did you see that too?\" she closed her mouth and mumbled out a \"yes\" and we spoke at length at what we had witnessed and the horror of the thought of what would have happened if that huge spinning rock had struck our world straight on instead on merely near missing our earth... it would have been catastrophic and to be honest i have never felt so small and insignificant a few hundred feet lower and i would have been atomized with hundreds of thousands of others. the object flew in a solely southern flight path and to the best of my knowledge it flew perfectly horizontal and exited back into space. i would also like to say that though it had a fire-trail the object was not burning up disintegrating or affected by our atmosphere whatsoever. and also it brought to my attention that their are gigantic objects in space moving unfathomably fast moving around us that we as a race have no clue about. i dont go out and look during meteor showers anymore not that im scared or anything i just had my fill of them thank you. as a footnote i wanted to to express that a giant meteor was in my opinion without a doubt killed the dinosaurs and i don't like to say it but i feel as collective life on earth will befalling a similar demise in the upcoming years from the

halfway across it blinked out suddenly same it came on.\r\njason","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was maybe 11-12 with my nephew who was 3 years younger. we were at our camp in cornell, mi (rural area). i had climbed into the top bunk w/him so we could look out the window-the bed was lengthwise against the window and when we lay down we were at eye level with the window. we see a light above the trees way off in the distance. at first we think it's a star, but then it gets brighter, then dimmer. we don't know what to think. we get caught up in being kids and not paying attention for a few minutes, then when we look, it's closer and brighter and looks a little bigger. weird. what is that?? next time we look, it's way closer and it's pretty bright. omg. now we are getting scared. within a minute i swear the light was right outside the window and filled the window and room w/light. you never saw two kids jump off a bed so fast in your life. woke my dad up, and of course, he thought we were nuts. \"get back to bed.\" we were scared and waited until he went in and checked it out and there was nothing there. needless to say, we slept in the bottom bunk. my nephew and i never spoke of it until about 8 years ago. i questioned him about it and asked him if he remembered that or did i just dream it. he said, \"no. you did not dream that. that was crazy.\" i told him i wasn't sure i had ever been that scared in my life and he agreed. unfortunately, my nephew died just 5 years ago. so there is no one to corroborate my story.\r\n\r\nbut, my story doesn't end there. it seems i would be visited more than once. i used to see things all the time in the sky and it fascinated me. in 9th or 10th grade, my very best friend since 3rd grade slept at my house (again, in cornell). we both wake up in the morning with what felt like weird dreams. we were on opposite sides of the bed than we were when we went to bed. she actually remembered more than i did, and yes, i am still friends w/her. \r\n\r\nforward 10 years or so, i am married and have two children. i never spoke to my kids about ufos as i never wanted to frighten them, and i wasn't quite sure what to believe. my 8 year old son begins having what i first believed was nightmares. he would come screaming down the stairs saying, \"mom, mom, there was a light in my window, and it was shining right at me.\"  i told him that it could have just been a car passing by and maybe light reflected into his room. this began to become an almost weekly (sometimes more) event. and it got worse. sometimes he swore he couldn't move and he felt like someone was with him. he would try to wake up his brother and he wouldn't wake up. eventually he started sleeping in his closet that was in between the two bedrooms upstairs. he did that for almost a year. he was terrified. i never told him i didn't believe him, but i would just tell him that we don't know what it is. i didn't believe he would be hurt. he continued to have these \"nightmares\" well into high school. i didn't want to believe it, but i think he may have been abducted. he is almost 30 now and he can hardly talk about it.\r\n\r\nwhen david was around 12 or 13, his dad and i were going to a party about 5 miles from escanaba, mi (where we lived). on our way there i notice a light above this field. we both think maybe it's a star. it's still sort of light out. the light gets a little closer and it's hovering. it's not a saucer, but is like a layer cake. i had never seen anything like it in my life. multi colored lights all around. but it was cylindrical. my husband (now my ex) was excited. the object descended below the near tree line and looked like it was landing in the field. i don't believe it made a sound. he stopped the car!!! omg. i was terrified and told him to drive. he actually wanted to go and check it out. uh-uh. ain't happening. drive the car. of course, we get to the party and are so shook up by what we saw that we tell everyone there and they all think we are nuts. \r\n\r\nhere's another interesting thing. my father (who was born in 1919) tells me he had encounters and has seen many unexplained ufos. he had been in the army, but i'm not sure what or when he saw things because he would never say more than that. so, my question is, have they been following three generations of us??? i told my son about your site here and i think he is still too traumatized to even want to think about it much. something happened to him when he was young. something that was very real to him. he was not a boy to make things up. he has graduated from law school and has a masters in human resources. but he still gets a little nervous talking about aliens. i thought i should get our story out there. we have no pictures or video. only our memories.\r\n\r\nthanks for giving me a chance to get this out.\r\n\r\n~marti (preferred)\r\n\r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or

events. i don't really know what to say here. i am still a little afraid of what may happen since i seem to have seen the same  3-4 people everywhere i have lived. they do not seem to age either but i know for sure i have seen them before other places. it is actually pretty scary. i have also had events where i see a flash and it feels like time had stopped and pit me back into where i was, i just know it did but time always seems to be right. i even have dreams where i see et's and they talk in a language i have never heard mostly sounds i have never heard yet i know what is being said.\r\n i also see groups of numbers and dots in these dreams and i also know how to read them and they are always what the et is saying. sometimes the dreams are the same one and once i swear i even say one after i woke up. i am a grown man and after that one i slept with my lights on for over a week. one event has been documented in tucson and phoenix in 1997 i think. i really do not remember what time of year but i think it was late summer. as with most of all i have seen i tried not to think about it too much but now i kinda want to know why i am seeing these things and especially am having these dreams. i have never told anyone about this other than my mother, wife and brother. well, my oldest daughter as well. i am 100% serious about every thing i have seen and am telling you and even willing to submit ant kind of testing to prove so. i am not crazy or have any medical issues, i have always just been a little afraid due to things i have heard happens if you report this stuff. now though i would really like to find out why...Why did i see these? why do i have these dreams? why does it seem like people who never age have followed me? why does time flash and seem to stand still yet time is as it always was? i would love some answers. \r\nthank you for your time. oh ya ...In my dreams...The et's tell \"earth time people\" as they say as to what our future holds in time with them.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown, N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,
