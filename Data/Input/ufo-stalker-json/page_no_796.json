in the sky out of my back door. i saw a light in the sky and it caught my attention because the sky was full of heavy clouds, and here the light appeared to be hanging under the clouds. i was seeing it just over the electrical wire that comes from our pole to the house on our west side. that wire was how i was gauging movement of this light, it hung in one place for about 10 minutes, and then began to drop down very slowly. with the movement of the light down, it began to occasionally get brighter, then fade, then get bright again. it got closer to the horizon, i am unable to determine whether it was actually dropping or travelling away from me. one time, it seemed to have a small, dim light separate and fly away rapidly, quickly fading away. within about 90 minutes i watched the light drop from above the wire in the beginning, gauging by the wire, to about the top of our fence, which is 5 foot tall, and fading in the brightness. it finally disappeared by getting lower and fading more and more. we have seen this same type of light moving from west to east several times. since it is opposite the movement of the stars, we know it has to be something other than our natural sky with very few clouds. i have reported this to our police department, and received nothing but a reaction as if i was either drunk, doped up, or just plain stupid. the first reaction would be that we were seeing an ordinary star, but this is much larger than a star. i would say that it appeared more like an airplanes lights when you see them approach for landing, but planes always blink, and this didn't blink. it was mostly solid, with only an occasional blink.","distance":"Over One

was very visible only about 3 or 4 hundred feet height and as i was passing it, it was turning with me as if it was also watching me. i kept driving until i couldnt see it, after i couldnt see it i turned around to go see it again but it was gone. another time that i have seen ufos was in 2013, i had just come home it was around 3am and i looked up, it was a somewhat cloudy night but what i saw was amazing, i saw multiple ufos, i stopped counting after i got to 13. there was atleast 20. i thought i was crazy or seeing stars but i stopped and stared for over 5 minutes as i watched them go past the moon! there are a few more times where i have seen ufos but these 3 cases were the most absolute, they were definitely our of this world, i was even a skeptic before i saw my first ufo, i

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Mid summer of 2013, my husband noticed very faint verticle beams of light on a nightly basis. every night, we would go outside and observe them. \r\n\r\none night between 9 and 11 pm, we took a blanket outside and watched the beams together, as they were particularly more active this night. sitting on a blanket, watching these beams of light, we found ourselves confused as to their starting point. were they coming from earth and beaming to the sky, or were they coming from the sky to earth? we couldn't distinguish. \r\n\r\nas we were sitting there, we called our son (10 years old) outside to see if he could see them. we told him nothing of our observations. we simply asked that he look around and tell us what he saw. initially, he saw nothing. we asked him to continue. finally, after about 3 minutes or so, emphatically, he exclaimed that he could see several beams of light. he, too, however, could not distinguish their starting point. \r\n\r\nas we were all sitting there on the blanket discussing possibilities, the three of us looked up toward the tree line because we noticed that, there too, were beams of light. as we looked up, we all saw a bright, gold disc. \r\n\r\nin that moment, not one of us can readily recall or identify our feelings and thoughts about what we were witnessing. it was as if we were, literally, in a state of complete shock or, perhaps, inexplicably victims of deliberate and well-designed mental captivity. only afterwards, have we been able to consider the occurrence. with that said, in that moment, we all, without doubt or question, knew that we were witnessing a genuine ufo visit. we knew that the craft was not of human construction.  \r\n\r\nin our recollection, we remember that the gold seemed to be a very bright light. very bright. the light, for some reason, though, didn't light up its surroundings. the light was confined. it didn't spread like a normal light.   \r\n\r\nthe object seemed to have two main sections. a center and a revolving outer disc. i could observe that the sections were separated by a relative small space. each section seemed to have an extremely fast rotating movement. each section, however, moved in the opposite direction of the other, yet equally fast. \r\n\r\nthe disc was hard to scale. our perspective was distorted due to the black, starless sky this night. however, within the view of our vantage point were trees. \r\n\r\nthe disc was slightly above the tree line, but our perspective, or lack thereof, made it difficult to gauge if the size was as we saw it to be (size of a normal, above-ground swimming pool), or if its size was considerably larger, yet further away. with lack of backdrop or other known and measurable objects around it, it has been impossible to properly approximate the size. \r\n\r\nwithin the course of a minute, the disc propelled itself to the southeast leaving no trace of it ever having been there.\r\n\r\na few things that my family and i noticed and discussed following the sighting:\r\n\r\nthe object seemed to provide its own source of energy from the two moving discs. \r\n\r\nthe gold color didn't seem to be the color of the object, but rather the color of the energy it produced.\r\n\r\nwhen the object propelled itself, there was no sound. there was no light path. there was no observable propeller. the movement could almost seem like that of a swiftly changing mind-quick and mindful.\r\n\r\nthe object was hovering in one place. in an instant, the object seemed to slingshot across the sky. \r\n\r\nthough we could see it move away, we could only see a small fraction of a second of its movement before it was no longer observable. \r\n\r\nonce the moment was over, my family and i, in amazement, sat in utter silence while still in the same place outside. while trying to conceptualize what we witnessed, we each observed the faint beams of light become more frequent and closer in distance to another. \r\n\r\nfinally, while grasping for clarity in our state of utter bewilderment, our confusion turned to suspicion of our government; for within the following five minutes of the object's appearance, a small plane began to fly in a triangular pattern, repeatedly, around the area of the sighting. from where the small plane initiated its flight and the location it ultimately retired, was charleston's air force base. for the next hour, several planes, of comparable size, flew in various, yet repetitive, flight patterns.\r\n\r\nto this day, we still look back at this perplexing experience in hopes to understand what happened. still, we are left bewildered. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

elevator lights went out, but we reached 5th floor. we pulled open elevator door and hall lights were out..Went into apartment and went to slider window. we drew open the curtains and behind our building is a good size baseball field. the entire field was covered with a huge spaceship with dim lights .  all of a sudden we heard a huge noise enough to shake a building  and moments later the sound of sirens. within seconds the spaceships lights became brighter and the lights were blue and white now and moving faster in a circle and the craft  lifted 20 feet off the ground and was suspended in mid air with lights moving around very fast and within seconds went up another 30 feet stayed for about 5 seconds and shot up into the sky in a left angle. we immediately went outside the building down the stairs due to the noise of the sirens and we learned that the generator across the street had exploded and that was why the fire department was there..Although we had our suspicions that it was the spacecraft that may have caused the explosion or maybe drew energy from the generator. there were three of us who witnessed this, only two of us talk about it.. the other person denies

thought they were birds or bats. i then started to think,its so dark out and they were kinda high up to see them so clearly and just how white they were. there was no sounds. the objects were flying in a v formation and two of the objects started moving out of the formation, kinda falling behind and irratically moving in the sky for about 30 seconds before rejoining the formation. i lost sight of

every away game thing me and my head coach did after everyone leaves field house.  i left going to my parents house out at the lake, takes 20 min. to get there. about a mile down the road, i noticed what looked like a new star or planet on the horizon, looked mainly white at first with a slight shimmer of colors.  i am a science teacher and was very intrigued with this object. as i left the outer part of town going east towards the lake, i kept looking at this strange \"star-like\" object. as i passed the turn in of our local country club, i started noticing that the object was not only bigger but also could start to make out distinctive fluorescent orange and green light emitting from the object.  at this point i was ten or so miles from it and started to believe maybe a was seeing another unexplained object.  this is the first time i have reported anything like this. as i got closer, within 5 miles, the object no longer looked white at all, only the orange and green lights were visible on top of a faint baby blue light.  the object did not looked like it had even moved, just kept getting bigger the closer i got.  when i was at my closest point to the object, best estimate a mile, the object had a distinctive shape of a perfect pyramid with three edges showing, middle edge was fluorescent orange with the other edges fluorescent green.  the base of pyramid looked to be sitting on a perfectly round baby blue disk with a yellow ribbon-like wave circling around its edge.  the two sides of the pyramid were a dull black barely reflecting any of the lights on the edges.  the best i can describe the pyramids lights would be like that of the light sabers on star wars.  the pyramid appeared to be huge, yet at arms length was about at big as a penny to quarter size and still had not moved hovering high in the sky, maybe a mile up.  it was at this moment that i lost sight of object and turned on road leading to lake house.  after about a half mile, i once again saw pyramid, but now looked about 3 miles away.  this was the last chance for me to see because of all the trees close to the road. it seemed to be now back towards town slightly. i now sped up and got to the lake house hoping to see it again, keeping track of where in the sky it should be. but once there, had clear view of the ne to se sky and saw nothing. i tried twice, going down highway, to take picture but got nothing except flash on windshield and one with my finger over phone camera with window rolled down.  i know my other two sightings were strange in years past, but at least could have been possibly explained.  this was different, i have no reasonable explanation whatsoever of this.  it was truly a mind-blowing experience for me.

mine from college and my cousin in [removed location].  we were all talking about something in much depth when i noticed my cousin staring over the ocean.  she seemed absolutely fixed on something in the sky.  when i asked her what she was doing all she could do was point speechless over the ocean. when i looked at what she was pointing to all i saw was maybe seven perfectly round illuminated small clouds in a circle.  i told my cousin who was still in a trans like state that it was probably the moon behind some clouds illuminating them.  \r\nshe then speechlessly pointed towards the moon which was much to my concern, on the other end of the horizon.  i was now absolutely captivated by this and soon was my other friend.  there we sat gazing at this thing in absolute paralyzing attention.  what ever it was, it seemed to be watching us even though it was hundreds of yards away.  it knew all of our fears and as soon as it knew we were watching it, it started to spin around a fixed axis becoming smaller until it disappeared into thin air.  we stood there looking to see if it might return, hoping that it did not, and it didn't.  i so much wanted to talk about what we had just witnessed but everyone acted differently about it.  my cousin stayed in a trans for the rest of the night and my friend was so frightened that he did not want to talk about it fearing that it might return.  i would like to know if i am alone in this witness!  i don't have any one to talk to and would appreciate feed back if at all possible.  thank you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

at [location removed].  we were just outside doing some work around the yard and the rv and just enjoying the view and the day.  the mountains always draw my attention and there is what i have been told is a border patrol blimp that they have up for observation many times.  \r\n\r\ni first noticed the object because it just sort of appeared.  there was no sound like with a regular aircraft.  it just sort of hovered in the area by the mountain.  it seemed to glint in the sunlight.  i am not sure if it was white or silver.  the shape was really strange like no aircraft i had ever seen.  it reminded me of a wishbone, or boomerang.  well, actually it reminded me of those balancing birds you could buy that had their wings stretched to the front.  \r\n\r\nas far as the motion, it just sort of appeared in the sky, hovered for a bit and then flew in a straight line to the west, and then just disappeared again.  there was absolutely no sound that i could hear, no engine whine or roar or anything.  the thing i thought was weird too is that unlike many of the flying wing type aircraft of today, it actually flew with the wings forward, not with the nose part forward.\r\n\r\nas far as my feelings and reactions - i definitely believe in ufos and i did not fear it but was enthralled with the sight of it.  i was excited.  i ran into the rv to get the camera and got a couple of shots before it went away. i believe that i went right in and downloaded the pictures off my camera, but i am not sure if i did it later or the next day.  i cannot remember now.  my husband was outside with me and he witnessed it as well.  he is more skeptical when it comes to strange things like ghosts and ufos but even he thought it was a little strange.  i don't really know how long it all took place but it stayed in place long enough for me to run in and get my camera and snap off a few pictures.  it was like a surreal moment, like time stood still.  the duration time i put is simply an estimate as i was not watching my watch.\r\n\r\ni used a regular digital camera and zoomed it as far as it would go and i only had one good picture and i had to crop it to get it to be seen as it is.  i am not a professional photographer nor has it been altered through photo shop or anything.  the second picture i am submitting gives a view of our site and the mountains and the electric wire which can be seen in the ufo shot to give a perception of where the object was.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering
