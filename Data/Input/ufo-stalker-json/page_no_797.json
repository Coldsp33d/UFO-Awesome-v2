Unknown","city":"Bristol","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of may 9th, 2015, around 9:40 pm eastern time (gmt -5) i saw a light in the sky outside my window. the light was bright enough that i saw it through 4 layers of dusty glass and just by glancing up from my computer monitor. the light was in the sky just above where i look to see my computer monitor. at first i thought the light was a low flying commercial air-liner. that should give some idea of the apparent size and luminosity of the object. \r\ni regularly observe conventional aircraft flying past my window as that area is an approach and departure lane for flights to and from the tri cities regional airport not far from here. the object i saw seemed out of place because it appeared to be coming at me nearly straight on, which is a flight pattern i have never seen from this position before. the light was white in the middle and very bright and about 15 or 20 times the size of a common star. all around the white light were smaller lights of different colors which included red, green, blue, yellow, purple, and orange.\r\n\r\n at first i was only able to see the red and white lights and this is why i thought the object was an out of place airliner. something didn't seem right, even aside from the fact that i've never seen an airliner flying this way before, so i decided to keep watching. after only a few minutes my eyes had adjusted somewhat and i was able to see the other colors of light and, by this time, the object hadn't moved so i knew that it wasn't a conventional fixed wing aircraft. the next thing i did was kill all the sources of sound and light in the room and open the window to listen for rotor noise. i could not hear any. i knew that even if the object were a helicopter or a uav i might not be able to hear it due to distance, wind speed and direction, noise pollution, or possibly because of rotor silencing technology. i kept watching. soon after i started listening for rotor noise, i closed my window and headed towards the back porch. as i was walking down the hallway i saw my father, [redacted], who had just returned home with my mother, [redacted]. i told him i was watching a ufo and he went to the back porch with me to see it. he saw the object and promptly went inside to get some binoculars. it was his opinion that the object was “something” meaning it wasn't explainable or conventional. the 3 of us continued to watch the object from the back porch for a while before i went to get my binoculars. i was not able to get a perfect focus with my cheap binoculars but i could see the object and its multi-colored lights in a little bit more detail. after struggling with the binoculars for a while i decided to go inside to get my camera and tripod. after figuring out how to set my camera for long-exposure i set it up on the tripod and put the lens on the object and took 3 or 4 pictures. i also took 2 videos. i continued to watch the object for a total of about 3 hours before i finally had to go to sleep. the object slowly became smaller and smaller until it was only about twice the apparent size of an average star. the object never moved in a way that was noticeable over a period of less than 30 minutes. the colored lights continued the entire time i watched the object. some time towards the end of my period of watching the lights/object i posted some pictures on facebook where it received a lot of attention from my facebook friends. at least 4 other people (7 people total, including myself) saw the object and, strangely, one of the people (person 2) told me he was looking in a different direction than i was looking to see the object. this seems to suggest to me that the object was not celestial/astronomical but was actually inside of earths atmosphere or that the object moved a very long distance before i spotted it. the people who said they saw the object are [redacted](person 1), (person 2), and (person 3). (person 1) said that another person that he was with also saw the object. (person 2) and (person 3) gave the direction of the object as “due west” and “north east”, respectively. (person 2) was about 7 or 8 miles from me when he saw the object. i do not know where (person 3) was when he saw the object.\r\n\r\nthe next night (may 10th/11th) i saw the object either near to or in the same place it was at the same time the night of the 9th. the object was a smaller size than it was when i spotted it at the same time of night on the 9th. other than its size, the object was the same on both nights. i watched the object for about 2 hours on the night of the 10th/morning of the 11th (until about 12:30am). on the night of the 11th i went to my sisters house to borrow her nikon dslr camera so that i could get some better pictures but it was cloudy that night and, if the object was still there/had come back, i could not see it. it was also very cloudy on the night of the 12th. tonight, which is the 13th, i took my sisters camera and my tripod outside to get some pictures, but i have not been able to locate the object even though it is only slightly cloudy. there are lots of trees surrounding the yard so the object could be out there somewhere where i can not see it. i will keep watching the skies as i always do and take more and better pictures if it comes back.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"03:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

sitting on his patio visiting on a summer evening around 7pm i was heading back to my apartment when something in the distance caught my eye at frist i thought a ballon came loose from some advertisement or something as it came closer i was unbelievably large i ran to my sons apt for him to come see it by then it was over our apartment complex it was then we all noticed 4  more following behind it one neighbor came out to ask us what we were looking at she and several other neighbors also came out we were all shocked and woundering what we were all seeing all of us seemed frozen althou we all had cell phone camras we seemed unable to focouse on any thing but looking at the 5 black objects as the slowly disappeared they made a slight turn as if heading toward the columbia river then turned headed east and disappeared this observation as i rember lasted 7 to 10 miniutes i cant find any one else that reported this but many had to have seen it i think it was a sundy

north anddoes this, gets nosey and goes almost over our heads n to s then se, pausing first, and also before the end. dont remember heat or not. at closest, it appeared like 50m or so away, but looking up isnt great for distance. if there were other features to it, they didnt much register. noise... certainly no chopper.  i don't  know if it was silent, but may well have been. also, have memory of like looking down on the folks and myself while looking up at the light. no odour i recall. and then just gone. before mom passed i asked her, but she nor dad recall. i think thats

enjoying an early cup of coffee before she had to leave for work. on this particular morning, she had to be there early.\r\n \r\nour house is located almost directly underneath the approach path for our local airport. over time, we have seen most every plane imaginable, short of the larger, full-sized airliners, as they come into auburn/opelika municipal/university airport. \r\n \r\nat this time of morning, there was no traffic on the road in front of our home and the sky was completely clear.\r\n \r\ni noticed what i first assumed to be a plane that would make a right-bank turn to line up with the runway. this would not be unusual. however, the lighting was odd in that it would have had to be a plane facing us to offer anything close to what we were seeing in width and display. moreover, there was not a sound. \r\n \r\nthe object crossed the sky from left to right at a very leisurely speed. our field of vision was limited due to trees but overall, it was visible for roughly one full minute.\r\n \r\nwhen it passed behind the trees, i could still see it by bit and piece through the leaves for another few seconds.\r\n \r\nattached to this email are two graphics. one is a picture of our field of view and the other, a map showing the standard approach to the airport, what would have been expected on such an approach and what we eventually, actually witnessed. \r\n \r\nalso, on the map graphic, i have included a reproduction of what we saw using some old graphics programs i have had for about a decade. it is not identical but it is fairly close to offer an idea of what was up there.\r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

unbelievable real ufo sighting. i was driving back from tuscon arizona on the i-10 interstate hwy heading back to riverside ca. it was app. 10 o'clock at night and i was in the middle of nowhere on this deserted hwy  i just happen to look up out of the drivers side window and i noticed this large completely round  30 to 40 ft basketball object. it was a dark brownish color ball.  i became very curious because it had no wings engines tail no lights it just cruised app. 500 mph towards ca. the weather was very good with no clouds. it moved in a very direct straight path at about 5 to 8 thousand feet  i was amazed very amazed how it just moved westward with no lights no noise ! as i was driving my car then the object passed me and about 3 more minutes it suddenly shot off at tremendous speed ! over the horizon ! i,d guess 50,000 mph unbelievable!  never seen anything like it  i was lucky to have witnessed this highly advanced machine in the sky  the g forces alone would crush a human.  this was not a meteor, comet, satellite or any man made object. it was a very very advanced intelligent ufo !  i would of loved to see its propulsion system  completely silent very powerful !  ufos do exist !  because i witnessed it   i had been employed as an engineer at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena california. and i know the difference between satellites and advanced off this world ufo,s this statement is given in complete honesty   i,m sorry i did not have a camera at this time.  thank you  dd.","distance":"Over One

was like a big triangle and it had three lights, one on each point, then i called my brother outside and he agreed that it wasn't an airplane, so we watched it for almost an hour. it sort of looked like when police use helicopters to search for people and they try to stay in one area but it wasn't searching for anyone, i don't think. it would fly around for a few minutes and go in all different directions then it'd just stop then start flying again. at one point, we'd thought that it left because we didn't see it anymore so my brother went back in the house but i waited for it to show up again, it came back a few minutes later but it just flew around for a couple of minutes and flew away. when it first showed up, it was still pretty light out so i got a pretty good look at the shape of it, but it ended up getting dark and we were only able to see the lights the rest of the time. i tried getting a picture of it but it kept coming out blurry on my phone's camera.","distance":"501
