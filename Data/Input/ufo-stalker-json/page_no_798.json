was still in the car with my brother while all the adults got out i would estimate around 70 adults got out. at this time what happened was the light got brighter and these beings started approaching

was visited again but before that i can say that i woke up in the car after i had watched the shuttle take off at incredible rate of speed i know i seen that but then i woke up in the car with

i witnessed a beautiful orange light far off on the horizon. it intrigued me because the orange color was so unusually beautiful i wanted to see the aircraft fly over and see what it was.  thought it may be a new model helicopter. it was stationary which generally means its an aircraft flying towards me.  over several minutes of enjoying the view and stars i noticed that this beautiful orange light hasnt moved position. i could tell because of the cell towers blinking lights. this grabbed my curiousity and i turned around opened slider door and shut it and looked out to see the light as i was about to run to grab binoculars and it was gone.  i ran back outside to the cliff to look for running lights or any light to justify what just happened.  there wasnt any aircraft lights in the sky. i must admit i felt a scared feeling i never felt before.   i ran to my neighbors house and told them what i had just witnessed so if someone did report a ufo sighting i would have credibility. couple of days later i googled ufo reports in ohio and there it was.  a ufo was reported in ravenna, ohio around 8 pm and vanished on march 2.  i would like to know more and if i can be of any help

some land near amarillo, texas, and my parents followed her parents out to visit the property and hang out. though i do not know the exact location, i know it was within 10 miles of the city.\r\n\r\nit was about midnight when we arrived and my girlfriend and i were drawn out into the field for some unknown reason. it was not typical for either of us to just wonder off into a dark field without our parents. her brother, my brother, and our parents were busy getting stuff out of their vehicles and apparently didn't notice we were walking off.\r\n\r\nwhen we got about 350 feet from the vehicles an object appeared in the sky on the right side of us and hovered there. it appeared without any noise 20 feet from us and about 30 feet above the ground. we both saw it appear and froze as we looked at it. i felt paralyzed, but not afraid, and time seemed to have stood still. i first noticed the lights, which were emitting from large circular windows. \r\n\r\nas i looked into the windows it seemed as thought there was some sort of thick colorful gas or liquid inside which pulsated in a way i had never seen. to this day, the closest thing i can use to describe it is bio-luminescence similar to a comb jellyfish, except that the colors swirled in the windows. i also recall that it seemed like colors were included that i have never seen before, colors outside of our normal visual spectrum. \r\n\r\nthe pulsating light coming from the windows mesmerized me, and i had a sense like something within the object was observing us. i remained calm, but in awe of what i was seeing. i could see the top and bottom half of the object rotating in different directions because the windows were moving in opposite directions. the light from the windows did not shine on the ground, nor did they seem to illuminate the outside structure of the object. but i know it was not orbs, because the object's structure blocked out the sky and stars behind it. which allowed me to see the general outline of the object. though i saw the windows moving around the object in a circular motion, i saw no moving parts or dividing sections. the surface of the object did not seem reflective, and was blacker than the night sky behind the object.\r\n\r\ni had the sense that something was being communicated, but had no way of articulating what it was. then suddenly the object zipped off in a straight line up into the sky and out of view. it was so fast that at one moment it was right there in front of us, and the next it was a tiny dot, then gone. i have never seen anything move that fast in my life. it did not cause displacement of air, and made no sound as it ascended.\r\n\r\nonce the object had ascended, my girlfriend and i looked at each other with our jaws dropped in amazement. we then ran back to the vehicles. though the event seemed to take about 5 minutes, our parents and siblings were still getting the same stuff out of the vehicles they were when we had walked off. we both adamantly tried to tell them of what we had seen, but were ignored as they were preoccupied with getting stuff out of the vehicles. \r\n\r\nafter this event, many things occurred which are hard to explain, but i suspect may be related. my girlfriend and i never talked about it, and years later she passed away in her sleep, leaving me to be the sole living witness to the event. until now, i have only told a handful of friends and family about my experience that night.\r\n\r\ni have searched various ufo photos for this particular object and the only one i have found which looks remotely similar in general shape is the famous gulf breeze ufo. i have included basic drawings i have made of to illustrate the experience of the object i saw.\r\n","distance":"20

seem to pop out of the air from nowhere.  there are other signs too..Their humour, for one.   they healed my cold sore that i couldn't get rid of.  they do other things too...Hard to describe...Like being removed from reality somewhat.  i spent quite a bit of time searching the internet to see if anyone else had ever seen them...Because they are so strange to the point i didn't know whether its a craft, an entity on its own or a spirit.  i found a report by a police officer in florida...I knew it was the same beings because he described them as so joyful, with a sense of humour and they healed his alligator bite....They were also  orange orbs. (they aren't orange all the time)  he didn't realize till the next morning his wound was healed. anyway, i am not the only one who saw them in august, 2005 because when i checked ufo bc ...The next day, august 22nd, a person in chilliwack saw what looked like an orange harvest moon in the sky that later disappeared.   that's the direction they were heading when they left burnaby on august 22nd.\r\n\r\nso what actually happened....I sat down on my porch looking south east  and my attention was caught by very strange movement in the sky.  two objects poured, as if from a jug, into my line of sight, criss crossed each other in a spiral and then slowed down and started circling around as if searching or sight seeing.  when they came they gave me the strong impression they were having fun. at that point they looked like two silver grains of rice.  i am no good at measuring distance.  my sight of one was blocked by a tree but the other moved northwest across capitol hill slowly.   i thought to myself, i'll know its a ufo if it stops dead in the sky.   the moment i had that thought, it stopped dead.  then it was like somebody lit a fire under it and it expanded into a glowing orange orb.   then it went back to normal size...Moved south east to its original location.  then it went across the hill again, just as before. then it stopped dead and expanded again as before.  then moved back as before and went behind the tree and didn't appear again.  i went into the house thinking i'm not going to tell anyone this.  then i started phoning friends.  one of my friends said go out tomorrow night same time because sometimes they come back.   so next night i went out, same time and i started to feel taking this sighting personally because just as i sat down that one came out from behind the tree.  again it went across capitol hill, stopped in the same location and then expanded as before...But this time it make a typical flying saucer shape in light....I thought these guys are joking with me.   i started looking around to see if anyone else was around, in the park or on the street....There was a neighbour in the park, she was bending down...I have the impression i called out to her...But things seemed different at that moment...When i think of it...Well the fact is when i think of it it seems strange...Like the world outside was slow and i was fast...Also the world seemed very bright...Hard to explain.   anyway it went back behind the tree and i didn't see it again.    the next day i realized my cold sore which i'd been having a hard time to get rid of was completely gone.   i emailed a writer in england i know and he told me the english call it geoplasma and people typically have a sense of communication with them.   geoplasma really means nothing...Just they don't know what it is....Except its light.\r\n\r\nthat's about all i can say for the orb.  i do have a lot of other strange experiences which is why i liked what bledsoe had to say...Kind of puts everything together.    sometime later i did see a triangle in sky when i was driving sought up gilmore avenue.  but that experience was a bit extreme...I stopped the car to get a better look and it started to move northwest...It changed shape twice...Once to an airplane and finally to a black helicopter with a blue light that followed my car.   i hardly ever talk about that experience because frankly people would think i was hallucinating.  i wasn't...Although i have to say when you see a triangle change to a plane then a helicopter you do get a strange feeling.\r\n\r\nin any event, my purpose in writing this is to say...It wasn't 1952 to 2008 or whenever mr. bledsoe saw them....They were here in burnaby at least since 2005 and i think in florida as well sometime before that.  they are probably always around.\r\n\r\ni have no picture of this.   on seeing something like this the last thing anyone would do is run into the house to get a camera.  it was an elevating experience to say the least.\r\n\r\njust another note:  i think you probably wouldn't get the humour in the bledsoe story but when i heard about one of the hunters being terrified by an alien animal chasing him, i thought i knew for sure its my friends from 2005.

 observed 3 to 5 orbs in a \"v\" formation on 3 separate occasions (no pattern to intervals), all located in the general vicinity of the captain mountains northeast of ruidoso, nm -- between carrizozo and roswell, nm -- above or near the ruidoso airport -- over approximately a 90-day period. \r\n\r\n1st sighting was clear night sky in late february;  2nd was high-altitude thinly overcast night sky late march or early april. i dismissed the first two events -- but remained baffled at the cause for the sighting -- but wrote them off to \"military training\" and some sort of new weapons systems.\r\n\r\nboth times the orbs were stationary and were east-southeast of my location near alto, nm; they were not falling night-flares, or lights descending or ascending, but had the capability of moving laterally at high speed, then stopping \"on a dime\".  appeared 1, then 2, then 4, then 3, then 2 then 3, then vanished one after another;  with the 1st orb pausing, then vanishing after the others. \r\n\r\nboth times the 1st set of two fighter jets appeared shortly after the orbs appeared.  the jets were moving at high speed (sub-sonic) toward the orbs, about 1 minute apart, from west to east directly overhead at my location.  as the jets appeared to arrive near the orbs they vanished one at a time.  the jets made a wide turn from eastbound and headed to the south and left the area.  those two sightings were nearly identical except the 1st event, there were up to 5 orbs in the same location, and the 2nd event there were only 3 orbs (...Possibly 4 because one appeared to vanish and move laterally, slightly out of the \"v\" shape, with slight separation to the east of the other two orbs).\r\n\r\nthe third sighting on 11 may 2015 at approximately 7:40 to 7:50 pm (mst) was unique. high thin clouds, night sky. same orange-yellow orbs -- same size, distance, and location in the sky east of my location in alto, nm.  again, two jets were heard heading west to east overhead (possibly from holloman afb) at high speed (sub-sonic)t toward the orbs, roughly 1 minute separation.  \r\n\r\nas the 2 jets approached, the stationary orbs once again vanished in sequence, with 1 orb pausing, then it vanished last, after the others.  they did not move. they simply appeared, one or two vanished for a short period, reappeared, then they all vanished for good -- in no particular sequence.  those orbs did not move from stationary position while they were visible and there was no sound -- nothing in my experience could maneuver like that -- except a helicopter or harrier-type jet -- but there was no sound except for the 2 approaching military jets.\r\n\r\nstill during the ongoing third sighting, as the jets sped east towards roswell and soon were out of sight (and sound range), two of the original orbs re-appeared in the same location as before -- stationary and silent.  it appeared as though the two jets moving eastward must have made a wide, right-hand turn and re-approached the orbs from the south moving northward at same high speed (sub-sonic).  \r\n\r\ntwo additional jets then appeared in the far northern sky estimated over vaughn, nm area moving south towards ruidoso, nm (again, not in formation) at a high rate of speed (sub-sonic) and with about a 1 minute separation (estimated 2 to 4 miles apart like the first pair). it dawned on me that they all may have been approaching in that manner for \"safety\" reasons, rather than flying in tighter formations.  the 1st pair of jets had done the same throughout the event.  a 3rd orbs became visible in the same stationary position as the other two to the east-southeast of my location.  \r\n\r\nthen, all of a sudden, two more orange-yellow orbs of the same size and brilliance, and due northwest of the the other orbs, appeared 90 to 100 degrees west of my location -- now there were a total of 5 orbs at two different locations in the sky. they too, appeared suddenly (one first, then the second - not simultaneously - but about 5 seconds apart) due north of my location -- and those 2 orbs sat stationary at approximately the same altitude as the other orbs but at a 45-degree angle from my location. \r\n\r\nthe second pair of jets that were arriving southbound from the north veered west, as the first pair of jets veered off eastward over the captain mountains, once again toward roswell. each pair of jets were moving in opposite direction. then the two stationary orbs directly north of my location moved horizontally at exactly the same moment about a mile westward -- then stopped -- as though \"teasing\" the jets that came from the north.  as those 2 jets moved west then made wide, left-turns headed south, the two orbs \"danced\" briefly, and then rotated impossibly -- at tremendous speed in a perfect - vertical circle, equal-distance from each other, and each with a very faint tail -- moving counter-clockwise like you were watching the tips of the hands on a clock move backwards (from my vantage point looking due north). it was a tight vertical circle estimated at 2-miles in diameter.  the speed they were moving was impossible (in my experience) -- it was an amazing display!  there is no drone or vehicle known in my experience that could do what those two orbs did.  they did two revolutions counter-clockwise, then stopped their vertical motion in a stationary, horizontal position about a mile or so apart, then one vanished and the second vanished within about 4 or 5 seconds, later, as the westbound jets turned left again and headed north toward the area of the two \"dancing\" orbs.  \r\n\r\nthe four jets remained in the area a few minutes after the orbs vanished.  two of them returned northward from the direction they first came;  the first two jets to appear on scene, moved southwest as though headed toward holloman afb.  the entire event from first sighting the orbs until all the jets were gone and drifted off in the distance (detected by sound) lasted about 15-minutes or less.  there was no \"hot pursuit\" -- in fact, the military jets appeared to be keeping their distance from the orbs -- intentionally.  once again the sky went silent.  i live in a very remote area, and when i say \"silent\" that is exactly what i mean.\r\n\r\ni noted that on the first pass by all 4 jets they were sub-sonic and displayed no lights.  as they came near to the orbs (say 3 to 5 miles away) they displayed safety blinking lights for the remainder of the event.  there was absolutely no sound from the orbs.  they appeared, moved, stopped in stationary position, then rotated, and vanished with no sound whatsoever.  \r\n\r\nmy wife witnessed the first sighting -- in fact, she called my attention to it.  she was not present to witness the 2nd and 3rd events.  i should say, that during all three sightings i did not feel \"fear\" - however, the orbs moving in the vertical circle was a pretty astonishing sight to see for an old air force veteran! \r\n\r\nnext time, i will try to film the event if it happens again.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":65429,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.5453572,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05142015-0005","longitude":-105.5722043,"occurred":1431414000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1431594547000,"summary":"Orange-yellow orbs appeared, were stationary, vanished, reappeared different location, then vanished.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/65429_submitter_file1__RuidosoCoconinoHseViewEast.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Capitan, New Mexico","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:37026"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Hatch","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were traveling north on hwy 89 near hatch utah.  my son who is autistic and rarely speaks unless he has a question or gets excited was sitting in the rear passenger side of our vehicle.  he says \"dad look, dad look\"  i thought he was just excited by the cloud formation as he is enamored with clouds and weather.  i was in the front passenger seat, we had the camera in the center console because we were shooting pictures on the way to red canyon.  i lowered my window and took the pic.  i tried to reframe a second shoot but must have panned the camera and just got a blurred imaged.  when i went to review the shot with him i noticed a blue blurred oval in the picture.   did not\"notice\" the blur when i went to take the picture.
