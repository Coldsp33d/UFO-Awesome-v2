reporting center at the behest of mr. peter davenport. per mr. davenport, there was an independent report of ostensibly the same object filed from maryland the same day. at the behest of mr. tom deuley, i am reporting it here, too.\r\n\r\non 7 may 2015 at about 8 p.M. edt, while sitting on my patio i noticed what appeared to be a particularly bright star practically at zenith. at first i suspected it was venus, but the object didn't act like a star. i had my wife keep eyes on the object while i retrieved two sets of binoculars, and we both observed the object. the object appeared to resolve as a tiny disk vice a point, so i had my wife continue to observe it while i retrieved my camera. when i returned, she reported that a tiny object appeared to swiftly go by the larger object, while the larger object appeared to remain stationary. i photographed it through a 250mm lens, and the image showed a round bright white object connected to a tiny object by a thin line.\r\n\r\nnext, i retrieved my 750mm telescope. my wife reported the object slowly creeping east southeast. its speed made it difficult to keep up with on the telescope's equatorial mount, and its speed seemed to increase toward the ese. when i finally got it in view, i observed it through a 7.5mm eyepiece, and it resolved into what appeared to be a white sphere connected to a small object via a dangling cable. the sphere was about 2 times the size of jupiter through the same eyepiece. the slow speed of the oscillation (>1 second) of the dangling object implied a relatively long line, and the oscillation would occasionally tip the sphere and expose an orange object at the interface between the line and the sphere. my wife, eldest son and i observed for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nat this point, i recalled the successful bombing of the mainland u.S. by the japanese in world war ii via hydrogen balloons, so i looked online for where to report this ostensible balloon. i quickly came across the national ufo reporting center, so i called them at 8:17 p.M. it was about when i called when the object faded out of view. the center operator requested i write this report, and suggested i call local law enforcement if i was truly concerned. i contacted fairfax county police, and they said they couldn't take action if the object were as high as it appeared (whereas they could respond for an aerial object threatening people on the ground, e.G., a rogue quad-copter).\r\n\r\nas i was compiling my data for the report, my wife came across a local news channel interview online with the national weather service about their radiosonde balloons. the balloons in the video looked much like the object we observed, so i called the ufo reporting center back. the operator suggested i do a winds aloft check to verify the direction of the object. the local airport at dulles didn't have an available report online, but the richmond, va, and westminster, md, airports did. the winds aloft report from westminster indicated that the balloon probably originated there: for the object to be stationary and then drift east meant that it passed between 18000 and 30000 feet. moreover, the winds from the surface to 18000 feet would have taken the balloon south and then west, which is where it was relative to westminster.\r\n\r\nattached are a 3x zoom of a crop of one of my photos at two contrast levels, a sketch of the view of the object through my 750mm telescope with a 7.5mm eyepiece, a screen grab of the winds aloft report from westminster, md for 7 may, and a picture i found online that seemed consistent with what i observed through the telescope.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

southwest.As it moved off i noticed what looked to be a very weak bluish light emitting from what previously was the top and bottom of the saucer when it was hovering horizontally.I can only guess that the color of the craft was gunmetal gray or black, since it was dark and the lights on it were bright but they were not illuminating it like i would have expected them to.After it had moved over

1998 i was living in wangaratta victoria when i noticed two orange coloured lights out of my window, i thought they may have been helicopters because it was still daylight, but as they got closer i noticed that there was no structure just two spheres . at this stage me and my brother both ran out side to get a closer look, once we had got outside they were hovering above the house the size of earth balls and the colour of the sun, well it was more like dancing similar to how jelly fish look  like underwater, these things appeared to be observing me and my brother, they started to get lower as they did i felt anxious, the only way i can describe it is that i felt like these things were beings of pure energy.\r\n so i decided i did not want to be that close as i started to move to go under carport , they also decided they had seen enough they started to spiral and got faster both of them started to take of following the path of the road , i was still under carport, but my brother chased the spheres down the road.\r\ni did scream at him to come back and then the most strange thing is they didn't simply take to the skies, but vanished into thin air, as if they were never there. i felt like we had just been given a glimpse of something that is always there but usually unseen, i know that sounds stupid but they were not random, they were aware of me and my brother and its weird having something watching you that doesn't have eyes.\r\nit has affected me in a very profound way, because seeing something like this first hand changes your whole ideology on life as we know it.\r\nthe attached artwork is a painting i did not long after the event, however the tails were added for effect.","distance":"20 Feet or

i said i feel awake now so i think i will get on my ipad. just then i noticed a bright flash of light in the bedroom that was white. i looked out the window and saw 7 red blinking orb lights in a row horizontally and they blinked randomly. they were positioned under a neighbors tree in the yard. there where no cars going up and down the road. if a car comes around normally i know what that looks like from living here for 18 years. the lights where visible for only 5 seconds and they didn't move like headlights. they looked suspended in the yard about 4 feet off the ground. they where about the size of a quarter from the distance of 40 feet.  my husband saw the flash of white light also but he didn't see the red orbs blinking. my first reaction was that was weird. i even said it to my husband. when i first noticed it i thought am i seeing police lights? but i looked where i saw the lights and they where too low to be where lights on a car would be on a police car. no cars where driving around. just the porch light was on on the next street from a house across the way. the lights did not actually move they where stationary after blinking randomly they just dissapeared.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":65396,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.7643569781825,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05122015-0023","longitude":-90.69298576197076,"occurred":1431336600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1431495954000,"summary":"Saw blinking red lights in yard across from us under a tree all in a row about 7 of them.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"63368","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"O'Fallon, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:37340"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Spring Lake","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It looked like two small red lights that had nothing flashing whatsoever, no other light colors: just two red dots that steadily moved s sw.. followed by a third red light that had a more commercial looking flashing red light attached to it.  i did hear a single motor sound about 30 seconds after appearance, sounding like a helicopter with a jet engine (the kind the police use, aka \"foxtrot\" in baltimore city). \r\nthe lights became obstructed by my house roof, and as i walked to the other side of the house to observe the lights in continuity, only one red light remained- the flashing one, which now had added a flashing white light. the two original red lights were not to be seen (i do have trees in the area so they could of been obscured)\r\n\r\nwhat made this interesting is that that first two lights were red with no landing/commercial lights. i live near a small airport, and national guard base, and am used to aircraft… but not aircraft with no blinking lights nor noise being trailed by a third aircraft with noise!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":65395,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.163058974681874,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05122015-0022","longitude":-74.04387025268738,"occurred":1431491400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1431494454000,"summary":"3 red lights total: 2 unwavering, no flashing lights, followed by 3rd flashing light","tags":["lights","flash"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0762","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Spring Lake, New Jersey","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:37341"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This sighting took place in may of 1975 in the desert of utah, at night, right off a highway while traveling towards colorado. to this day it was been a scary and unexplained event in my life. \r\n\r\ni saw a full side view of a very huge bright lit multi-colored (mostly variations of blues, as i remember) circular in shape tunnel looking (vortex) like thing, swirling over the flat desert floor.  it appeared to be several miles long (tube shape), extremely tall in height and just a couple miles off the highway i was traveling on.  i'd just like to know if anyone else has ever seen something similar, and if so, what could it be?
