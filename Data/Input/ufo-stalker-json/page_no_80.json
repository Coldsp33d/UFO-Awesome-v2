thirteen. i fell in love with the stars, you can see the milky way right out the back door. there was a time when i wandered beneath the blackened sky with a safe feeling amongst the constellations...... now i'm terrified to take the dog out. the main even i'm reporting on, happened tonight. i've never seen so many unusual lights. but let me give you back story. \r\na few summers before i moved here, there were reports in this very small, rural community about about three horses and a dog coming up mutilated. the owners found them with slit throats, methodically done. a friend of mine who lived on the property next door, found a jar sealed with wax, filled with dead honeybees. \r\n\r\nthe activity started up very badly this past year. i have approximately 50 acres of land, we don't use the back part at all. there is a large hill that blocks view of the rest of it, and onward. the past year or so, i've seen these shimmering lights on that back hill. it may be further than my own property, but they are not constantly there. some nights you can't see them at all. they're ghostly, blueish white, some are coppery. they kind of... roam around back there. a week ago, i observed three lights rise from back there. they looked so close, like they were right on the back hill. one was a slim, rectangular panel of lights, that tilted from side to side very slowly ascending from the hillside. above it several hundred feet in the sky, was another silvery light that kind of blinked. it rose at the same exact pace, but looked almost like a star, flitting in little circles as if trying to stay in place. once the paneled lights were a couple hundred feet above where they had arisen, both lights began to head from the eastern sky to the southern, at an unhurried, casual pace. i became aware of another light in front of the big one, a small gold orb. all three objects kept in some strange, equally balanced flight path. never accelerating nor falling back more than the space they'd risen to sky in, yet moving along the sky. it's hard to explain. this occurred around nine pm. \r\na couple weeks ago, my whole family was home, it was late afternoon. a very loud roar that shook the house rang through an approximate 10 mile radius. it was out of nowhere, there were no clouds, no jet streams. there is a base(s) in the city, but we are nowhere near it. we don't hear war games. and we've never heard anything like it before or since. my father was outside, he said it sounded very metallic and loud. i asked around in the community and a few others living around the roads here also heard it and found it strange. some explain it away as something to do with the wind turbine farms in the neighboring town, but again.... we don't hear anything to do with them, and they've been built around for years. we've never heard a peep. \r\nand only one sound? \r\n\r\ntonight i saw two of the long paneled lights instead, rising from that eastern hill. this happened around 8:30. around 9 ish, i became aware of a very bright white orange light. it didn't hover, it was absolutely stationary. and it was there for some time, looking to either be mere feet above my garage, and small looking, or much higher and much larger. the light was so bright it cast a long shape \"twinkle\" shape that didn't move. i watched it for a good ten minutes. before it silently, casually turned and bumbled off in a smooth flight path to the southeast, southern sky. \r\n\r\ni've seen strange shapes walking around out there in the middle of the night. complete soundlessness..... \r\n\r\ni'm honestly baffled and terrified. i really would like to speak with someone.... i think it needs to be staked out, which i could assist with, and host. i need to know i'm not crazy. i need to know if i can believe the lights in the sky. i can't bring myself to walk back to that hill alone, something drives me inside. i used to feel safe beneath the sky, now all i see is some slinking menace. i don't believe i have a camera powerful enough to capture anything. please help. thank you p\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

was driving home along a remote highway in february, well below freezing, when i noticed a white light off in the distance behind me.  i thought it was another vehicle along the highway, as it seemed to follow the topography, but the speed at which it caught up to me was at least twice the highway speed i was driving.  thinking it was another passenger vehicle wanting to pass, i slowed down slightly and veered off to the edge of the lane to allow easier passing but the single bright light did not pass me.  in fact, the light did not move at all.  it was at eye level with me in my vehicle, and it followed me at a distance of less than 10ft behind my bumper.  because it did not pass me, i sped up and the light kept up with me going faster than highway speed as well.  it was then that i began to think that something was \"off\" about this light behind me, as it didn't move side to side like a normal vehicle or motorcycle, and it didn't seem urgent to pass me.  i didn't want to pull over as the area i was in can be home to some rough first nations groups, so i kept driving but turned my radio off.  \r\nthere are no street lights on this road, or homes close by, so i couldn't make out the shape of the object shining the light behind me.  after these tense 5 minutes, the light shining behind me went out all of a sudden, and i began to feel scared.  i looked in all my mirrors and directly behind me to see if the object had turned off on a side road but i couldn't see anything going in those directions.  i kept looking around and after 10 seconds a set of car lights coming the opposite way down the highway appeared over the small hill coming towards me.  i waited another 25 seconds for the car to pass me and see if there was anything still behind me, but when the car passed i couldn't see anything behind me.  i still made it to my destination on time, but i cannot figure out what it was that i saw that night.","distance":"20 Feet or

same bridge around the same time, 6:00 pm, and witnessed much the same as he did. the family friend also showed up and witnessed the event. this time, the lights began as three and gradually grew in number to five. the way they did this is indiscernible, it seemed as though one light would merge with another and form into one, or break off into two. they looked like large stars, flashing all colors of the rainbow randomly. some lights maintained cooler colors, some warmer, and one remained glowing white throughout. around the area, same as the previous day, there were between 5 and 10 aircraft circling the area. we watched for almost 45 minutes, before i took to the general perimeter of the event. due to the low elevation of most of our part of the state, i caught only a few glimpses on the round trip, but when i returned to the bridge about an hour later, one light was still visible. i filmed for a few minutes before being stopped by a police officer, who let me go without even asking for my license after seeing the light as well. he did tell me not to linger long, but in the few minutes i stayed after he had left, two more lights had reappeared. i left the bridge at about 8:10 with three lights in the sky.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"02:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

girlfriend in the yosemite california area.  my girlfriend and i left yosemite valley heading for tuolumne meadows on a 4-day backpacking trip.  we departed from the east end of the valley near mirror lake and headed toward hidden lake.  \r\nit was our second day out i think, and we made camp next to a stream.  there was a meadow about 60 yards in diameter to the west, so we decided to sleep in the middle of it.  we took our sleeping bags out there and put our ground cloths down and saw the sky framed by the tops of the trees.  we were at an elevation of approximately 8,000 feet.  it was summer time late july or early august.  we had not seen any other people on the trail for over a day and as far as we knew there were no people within miles of us.\r\nas we were watching the sky, suddenly, a large object came over the top of the trees from the west.  it glowed from within but not like a balloon. it made no noise as it moved into our field of vision and eventually was directly overhead, we were standing looking at it and talking to each other in disbelief. on the bottom of the craft it had 3 lights and each one rotated in a small circle.   they were positioned close to the outside edge and in an equilateral triangle configuration. i can only guess at the size of the object, but my guess would be 300 feet in diameter and 1500 feet high. i remembered the color of lights at one time but only know the lights were red, blue and yellow now as a guess.  \r\ni remember talking with my girlfriend to confirm she was seeing the same thing and she was. i clearly remember the feeling that this was a very unique experience and was excited.  at the time i had no awareness of flying saucers or ufo’s.  i was 19 years old at the time. the craft then zoomed at a very high rate of speed, several miles away to the east and stopped and hovered for a couple of seconds and then a beam of light came out of it toward the ground.  a flash of light came up from the ground and then it took off out of our range of vision.\r\ni remember talking to her about the experience and we were at a loss for what it could have been.  the following day we encountered some other hikers and we asked them if they had seen anything unusual the night before.  they hadn’t and then we recounted our experience and they were interested in our experience and one person said they had seen a blue ball of energy travelling up yosemite valley one time from vernal toward nevada falls.  this had occurred at another time and long before our encounter.\r\nwe completed our trip without any further sightings.  i eventually lost touch with this person, but we did speak of it several times in the few months following.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

myself to see if i could see anything.  i live out in the country with no so close neighbors.  when i first went outside i didn't see anything.  i went out my back door so i decided i go to my front yard to see if there was anything still nothing. but my dog started barking and went running, i then turned around to go back to my backyard and then that's when i seen an object hovering over my barn, the barn from me was about 100 yards so the light the object was giving off was super bright.  it hoovered enough for me to go run inside to get my nikon coolpix camera. when i went back outside it was still hovering over my barn.  the time was around 11pm. i was able to start recording the object as soon as it started to take off slowly.  i live pretty close to the missouri river so the direction it was heading was towards the river.  where i live i see all kinds of weird stuff.

the grey circle outline and the white small light that very strongly resembles a star. as soon as i realise that what i'm starting it is not a plane, i slight freeze. not in fear, just in pure awe

a ufo, but it only continued to move straightforward. i lost sight of it as the house next to me blocked my view of where it went. i didn't think to take a picture because i know my phone can't capture the stars so how could it capture this that is as small and dim as a star. i was upset once i couldn't see it. i went inside and called my mom outside. i told her about it and i tried to look

(argentine coast), which came up to virgins cape in the magallanes strait in that year.\r\nthat mega construction with towers of 210 feets hight and thousands of post (eucalyptus) and wires was

there a week, but the place awaiting us with a surprise.\r\nin the early morning we go to the sea (4 miles away), we chosed go by foot to make natural phot and video.\r\nin the trip we cu off by a \"ravine\" (a little canyon) of 150 feets tall or less, in a curve of this we can see at the top five white range rover evoque, some people dressed in rare almost traslucid clothes, three 30 feets

and then from there something answered from the sea, again and again.\r\nthis people see us and we waved our hands to say hello and they did the same.\r\nwhen we arrive to the coast, we find two men more, they talk with us and said \"hello, are you here to see the post office?\" (???)\r\nwe said \"yes\" and they said \"you are needed to see a last telegraph reference, a bronze tribute plate\",

may be an aircraft (as there is an airport in sacramento area (and i live 40 miles north of sac), but it was moving up and down and zig-zagging..... which a plane cannot!  so, i ran in the house and

that is e from where i live (about 38 miles).  okay, then i had my cellphone and filmed some of the item fading into the clouds and coming out and moving around in an unusual manner.  it was impossible to get a distance feeling of it or a static feeling of where it was going with no stars out or reference points.  i did not feel it was real close, but i could see it fairly well.  some of my pictures, especially when i froze the frame of the video, it had a saw blade looking edge to it but on others, it looked like a ghostly orb.  strange but not something i had ever seen before
