vegas nv.,i witnessed and filmed with my cell phone (iphone) two light anomalies. the lights were extremely bright and stationary. the altitude of the aircraft was approximately between 25,000 and 30,000 feet above the ground at the time of the sighting and was about 20 minutes outside of mccarran airport in las vegas where we were preparing to land. i first noticed the lights as i was looking out of the window and a glint of the objects caught my eye, for a moment i thought it was another aircraft approaching us, which startled me terribly because they appeared so very close to us. but after looking closer it seemed to be two stationary lights that seemed to emit a burst of light from each horizontal end almost like a pulse of light. \r\n\r\non film it almost looks like a wave of heat or shimmer coming off the right anomaly. it reminds me of the heat wave pattern you see coming off of your car engine on a hot summer day. each light appeared to be a thin slanted line with a small horizontal line at the top outside edge of each light, the two shapes almost formed a v shape with the bottom portion of the v missing, almost like two modern day slanted car headlights. the video of them shows them more as round orb like objects, but they were definitely more thin and sharp in shape. they did not appear to be coming from the ground, because of their brightness, the altitude of the aircraft and size of the lights. i observed the lights for about 10-15 seconds before i grabbed my phone and managed to capture 20 or seconds of film. i lost sight of the object after the pilot began to turn right which made filming harder to do since we were already preparing to land and i had my seat belt on, but after filming i witnessed the lights for another 10 seconds or so before i could no longer see them. i am unaware if any other passengers witnessed or filmed these anomalies. shortly after filming the lights, we hit a pocket of extremely bad turbulence unlike i have witnessed in a very long time which most likely is just a coincidence, but i am including here for details about the event.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":65390,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.804619699999996,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05122015-0018","longitude":-116.40979899999999,"occurred":1430940000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1431480157000,"summary":"I

(8-8:30) and observed the object for 10-15 mins. it was very bright and i had never seen anything that large and bright. first thought it was a b-52 from nearby march afb but it wasn't moving. this was odd so i stood there trying to figure out what it was. left to go eat and tried as often as possible to watch it. when i arrived at the restaurant (10 mins.) \r\n\r\ni had to practically drag my sister in law outside to see it. she was impressed but had to get back to work. i ate quickly and drove back home and had been about an hour from first observing it. still was in the same location and as close as i could tell, the exact location. i stood there watching and saw what looked like small aircraft flying around it 4-6 i would say and thy all flew off at about the same time slowly like a small airplane or helicopter. i decided to go next door to get witnesses as no one was at my home and two brothers whom i had never met, said come outside and check this out. they did and we walked across the street and observed it passing around a binocular silently. the object started moving away slowly and continued until out of sight maybe 20 mins. \r\n\r\nfinally one brother said to the other \"what did you see?\". the other brother found a stick and drew what looked like 2 pie pans connected. his brother said \"that's what i saw\" and i chimmed in \"me too\".While looking through the binoculars the object appeared to be moving up and down fast, not far just enough to look out of focus is the best i can describe it. well... we stood there for some time saying what was that? all the time it was moving away and was about the size of a star, i heard a jet which actually was two fighter jets flying higher and faster than i had ever seen and commented \"i can't believe there was no sonic boom\" don't know if it was they were so high? i could clearly see 2 jets flying directly towards the object and said i don't think they are going to catch that thing. we all laughed and went home. that was 44 years ago and have told many people this story and have been interested in the topic ever since. \r\n\r\ntwo days ago saw for the first time gordon cooper's testimony and then ed mitchell's and led to discover the sirius disclosure project. i find it interesting that being an follower of news and programs concerning ufo's that i had to stumble across this info when it has existed for decades! i will do my part to try to spread the word for people to watch some of these testimonies. this info should be cataloged on youtube to make it easier for people that don't think they have 35 hours to watch it all. i am retired now and may be interested in helping in some way. the truth must come out!!! not sure what would happen afterwards when the whole world learns that not only ours but other gov'ts have been keeping what could be the salvation of this planet to weaponize it???? that is another subject. please let me know if there were others that reported the same one i saw. it was a clear late spring or summer day and other people must have been out and seen the same thing. i did wait 44 years to report it maybe others did the same.

\"star\" in the sky. as i looked closer i knew this was too bright to be a star. as i called my mom's attention to it.. it moved. i sped up to a clearing in the trees and parked in a parking lot for a better look. we witnessed 3 of these pulsating white/orange/red orb like structures \"dancing\" in the sky. they began to move east. i followed them. 1 broke pattern and circled behind us swooping low in sky with no sound. it hovered overhead then headed back west. i turned car around to follow it. as we turned south toward our home the orb i had been watching stopped abruptly and darted south parallel with car. my mom and i switched places so that i could keep eye on object. \r\n\r\nwe drove 3 miles south to our residence. as we pulled into driveway it darted again straight up over tree line. i called my brother and had him meet me outside. we proceeded to photograph and video object over next hour. as we concentrated on the 1 orb. several more started to appear. it was hard to distinguish them from stars until they flew in closer and began to take on orangeish hue. one came directly over our heads and just hovered silently. they all pulsated/flickered. it seemed as if when they were about to move they'd get dimmer almost go out completely then get real bright and move much closer at high speeds.\r\n\r\n my family returned inside after watching for over 1 hour. i remained outside and was determined to stay until they left. i watched planes fly in very close proximity to objects. after planes passed the orbs would trail them for a while and stop. after watching the orbs for 2 1/2 hours i came in because i believe i saw a much larger dark triangular shaped craft silhouetted against clouds. it had no lights and a very faint noise to it. at that time i believed that i was witnessing a legitimate ufo sighting and came inside to report immediately while details are still fresh. my brother also has video. his phone took much more detailed video than mine. but here are some stills of orbs. faint light pictured is when they were distant and appeared to be stars. the amber colored one was when it moved closer.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

dad and my sister were going to mcdonald's to get something to eat around 9 or 10 pm its not the exact time it happened so long ago and i try to ask my sister if she remembers she doesn't like to talk about it. anyway we where heading north on hwy 494 about 4 miles before the city limits i saw a falling star it got my interest so i leaned forward to look straight up out windshield at the sky and there what looked like shooting stars continuously flying from left to right north to west back and forth both ways they were not falling just shooting back and forth for as long as i watched them it only took about 4 mins to get to town i couldn't see them anymore or didn't see them then i don't remember but there's lights in town and its dark and country like where we saw this so anyway we got our food and headed home on the same route in the same part of our trip we saw the flying stars a super big object caught my eye following the river in between the trees i don't know if it was moving but it seemed to be hovering following the river we didn't stop we were moving so i don't know if it was moving or not i told my dad and sister to look my dad didn't seem to take it serious or something i don't remember but we didn't stop the object seemed to be grey or lead color or something the only way i could see its shape was because it had very large round glowing lights along the center of it the lights didn't shine or cast shadows they just glowed the object looked like what id call a super-dome the stadium in new orleans so we kept going until i couldn't see it anymore if it was moving it was slow because we passed it up we got home ate or whatever my sister was so young she might not have cared and my dad acted uninterested all he would day as he saw it too but didn't seem to want to talk about it i still ask my sister to this day if she remembers it she say yes but don't go into talking about it. ok time for bed  i don't know who was up i went in my room and shut the door and went to bed.\r\n\r\n soon as i laid down i started feeling a presence outside my window like someone was there and looking at me it got stronger and stronger i got so scared i started praying very hard asking god to please help me i have never prayed so hard or been so scared in my life i put my head under the covers on my bed and prayed begging god to help me i took my head from under the covers and something like glitters or sparkles fell from the ceiling in my room all the sudden all the fear was gone it seemed like i was just overwhelmed with peace i went into a deep sleep all this only took like 5 mins but it seemed like forever when i was scared  i have never in my life felt that kind of fear. \r\n\r\nanyway in my dream i walked outside to the end of our pool all that was normal but when i got the the end where it slopes to go down to the river instead of the river the darkness of the night seemed to turn red it was like i was at the end of the world i could see planets and it was not black like in space it was like all a reddish haze like the atmospere or space or whereever i was was not black the planets i saw didnt look like earth does from space and it was not black there it was all this reddish haze.  that is all i remember about the dream the next day i would ask my dad did he remember again he would say yea but wouldnt talk about it nobody wants to talk about it i have told a couple friends they dont take it serious but i want to know if something happend to me its very serious to me i have to drink just to sleep mostly now through the years i have dreamed that a saucer shipped beamed my dads friend up the very next day they said he died this has happened to 2 of my dads good friends same dream of them getting beamed up over their houses next day my dad tells me they died i saw one of his friends wife a few months ago i got very emotional for some reason i told her about my dream she said she had the exact same dream we all lived on the river i saw the dome on its called cane river dads friends were named [name moved to fi section/cms/tg] and [name moved to fi section/cms/tg]  i have so many more stories over the years i hope someone in my area can talk to me serious about this about the last weird think is i woke up after a hard sleep i sat on the edge of my tub to put my socks on and i noticed i had 3 perfect circles in a triangle formation on the bottem of my foot they were light purplish red i touched them i didnt feel anything at all like if it was bruises it didnt feel nothing i went on with my day i told my friend about it i was going to show him but they were completly gone no trace of them like fading when a bruise heels. i have seen maps ive never seen before i have been places  cant explain in one dream i im driving in a location im familiar with all the sudden everything changes i start seeing people i have never seen and im lost i take my phone out to try to gps where i was it could not locate me i was completely lost as a kid i would have deja vu alot i had already expierienced things that that i had akready been to or happened every monday my head would hurt so bad i would bump my head on the wall or something just to make the headache move for just that instance . ive had a glowing in the road in front of me on the road not long ago it didnt have a shape it looked to be about 2 miles away i didnt know what it was but i got very scared and wanted to stop and not go to it but it vanished i have so many more stories i need someone to talk to that takes me serious and can maybe help me figure out if something is going with me or not o and the headaches just went away one day after a few years of having them","distance":"501 Feet - 1

celebrating her marriage. the group of us kids went for a walk down the road to where there was a trail leading up a small mountain to a cleared out area on top used by a local church for picnics. we all went up to the top and were kicking around a soccer ball. at one point the ball went off the back side of the clearing and into the spindly pine trees that were roughly 30 to 40 feet tall. i went down to retrieve the ball and once having it, i happened to look up into the tree tops.  this is when i observed a circular bowl-like depression roughly 40 to 50 feet in diameter in the tree tops. the depression was maybe 15 to 20 feet deep at it's center point. i ran up to the clearing again and told my brothers and cousins about it and we all went back down to look at it. everyone was speculating as to what had caused the depression. some said it was a tornado type wind. we discussed this and it was unanimous that this was not the cause of the depression because all the tree tops were laid out in the shape of a \"bowl\" with the tree tops laid out evenly all around and not twisted in a circle as if caused by a circular wind like a tornado. we discussed this situation for some time and could not determine what may have caused the depression in the trees.  the only thing we could think of that could cause such a depression was a ufo.  we all laughed about this but could not determine any other explanation that would explain the cause of the depression. this explanation sort of spooked us so we decided to go on back down to my aunts house. eventually, being young kids with no experience investigating ufos or knowledge of organization that investigated such, we just let the experience fade away into our past. i have discussed this sighting with both my brothers and they remember it vividly. i, as well as my two brothers have experienced other sightings of suspicious lights in the night skies that were obviously not from known air craft due to their movements in speed and angle of flight.","distance":"21-100

up\" facing the baseball field across the street. there was an orange glowing ufo across the street sitting on the entire dirt part of the baseball field. my whole family 2 brothers, 3 sisters mom went out to it. we went across the street walking in a dreamlike state. all of my neighborhood friends were there too, and their families (at least 3 coming from all directions). everyone was calm. i remember walking up the ramp that was facing nnw 2 by 2. (i'm around in the middle) i\"m thinking i don't like this, but could not stop myself from going in. inside was still the orange glow. the next thing i remember is there are many different small rooms. (being older now i'll say 6x10). there's medical equipment in my room and 3-4 beings, things, \"doctors\" all with their backs to me. they had aprons on, medical masks. (i remember this because their cloths reminded me of the hospital). i don't remember how i got up on to the exam table, but when they turned around i started screaming. i don't remember hearing my screams, or how they muffled it. they had big dark almond shape eyes. one or two started \"working\" on my left knee, and another one or two were up by my shoulders and this long large machine started coming down from the ceiling towards my left eye. i remember telling myself \"their doing something to my knee\", i could feel something going under my kneecap right where they were just touching poking for a spot. the machine is now so close to my eye its going to go in...I don't know if i fainted, but the next morning i woke up and told my sister and brother about this weird \"dream\" i had about the ufo and what they did to me. i looked at my knee and there was a healed scar that wasn't there when i went to bed. as i'm telling them they said they had the exact same dream about the orange glow ufo being across the street walking to it... they had healed scars in different places than i that weren't there when they went to bed too. so did our friends. i have always remembered this. recently i asked two of my sisters if they remember that day, and they do. the oldest sister said the scars are triangle on her, and low and behold, so are mine. interestingly at the baseball field, they have never had to mow the grass again because it never grew back! it always remained dirt. it never grew grass again. i certify this is 100% truth to the best of my ability and memory. i believe if we go there and test the ground it still may have evidence of radiation like they leave. my sisters are willing to talk with you also if need be. i can draw what i saw if need be, but currently there are no known photos at least from my family. i'm not sure about the other families if they took pictures or not.
