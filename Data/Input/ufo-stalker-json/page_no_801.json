binoculars are 15x70, 4.4fov. clear day, few contrails, couple small clouds, maybe only 3 percent in sky. caught star sized blinking light (slight white-orange). probably around 5:40pm. would watch it, neck get tried, stop, then anywhere from 2 minutes to 5 minutes would look back and find it. \r\nat 6:10pm, looked up and it (or maybe a different one?) was blue! bright metallic blue, medium tone, not a dark blue. watched that as long as i could (3 to 5 minutes?)was moving west towards south slow. came into the house. several minutes later went back outside to spot it again and it had a pink-ish slight red, but mostly white. in the meantime it was (if the same one) always throbbing from real dim to very bright un-rhythmically. \r\n\r\nas i was lowering and raising the binoculars (neck strain), i then saw another dim light appear near the one i was watching (in the fov- field of view) then was brighter then started blinking. then another. then i was moving my binoculars around slightly to see another, 4 total. they were all moving west and west south except the original one which stopped blinking, was steady-ish light (one of the new ones, somewhat slowly, flew \"through\" the original one. i first thought they were going to merge, did not). lost track of the other three.\r\nthe original one eventually started to blink again. moved slowly to the west almost directly overhead. flew past venus (which in the day looked like a round small disk), then was heading back the opposite way towards the east. then i lost sight.\r\nnote: at one time i saw a balloon with the string drifting faster and high (it was a lot bigger that the lights moving south), i could easily see the shape of the balloon. another time near the end of my viewing, something came moving past my fov that was close, moving east. had no string, was bright orange, shape seemed to have lots of triangles and was \"rolling\" took up about 1/2 my view. thought it was maybe a balloon, but didn't want to take my sight off the multiple blinking lights at that time.\r\nthe winds usually move west towards the north here in santa ana next to the south coast plaza (border costa mesa), orange county, california.\r\n\r\nabout two years ago, saw one with naked eye that was reddish white on a late friday sun still up. saturday i forgot to look again to see if they were there but sunday went out to the backyard late in the day about the same time and wallah! about ten minutes later we saw three more appear and hover, some slightly drifting,(didn't have my binoculars then) they were pulsing red/orange. after about twenty minutes, they started to move in different directions. one south, one west (almost over our heads) and the other two went north. after they started to move, they started to twinkle very brightly as they were moving faster and vanish (i only saw two vanish but they others also were gone).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

dinner on sunday may 10, 2015. at approximately 6:40pm pst my family i had just finished eating dinner while sitting outside on the patio. we were noticing some small birds gathering near my parent’s birdfeeder when we then saw 4-5 large egrets fly over the house. this in and of itself is rather odd, as that is not a bird we typical see in the area of the coachella valley.\r\n\r\ni turned towards where the egrets were coming from and noticed a silver sphere/orb rise above the roof line of the neighboring house. i would estimate this object to be within a mile of our location and no more than 1,000 off the ground. it appeared to be a perfect metallic sphere, with no visible wings, engine, windows, landing gear, etc. the object was also completely silent and no other visible planes were in the area at that time. my mother and i saw the object for about 10-15 seconds before it disappeared behind a small gathering of clouds. \r\n\r\nwe were about 10 miles away from palm springs international airport and regularly see planes flying above and near the house. i am also a member of the palm springs air museum and consider myself an amateur airplane photographer and have the

we noticed a pulsating orange and yellow sphere traveling what we believe to be se to ne. at first we thought it was a plane with its collision lights on but as it got closer i knew that the light was not white but orange. there were no blinking red and green lights and the light did not diminish in intensity until after it had traveled several miles past our location. there were no apparent sounds from a jet engine or props, just quiet, even though it appeared to be less than a mile away.\r\n\r\nwe thought it may have been a military chopper but it would have had to been flying extremely quiet. then we noticed a second light on the se horizon heading our direction. we were discussing whether the object had circled when we noticed several more appearing from the same direction. i then went in to the house to grab my cell phone to take some photos and get my wife to come out to look at what we were seeing. within the next 20 minutes we observed approximately 36 of these lights all the about the same size, with the same color characteristics, flying the same direction from the same area as the others appeared, with no noise and eventually going dark at about 3 to 5 miles from our location.\r\n\r\ntheir speed was slow almost to the point of what i would call floating but definitely moving faster than a balloon but slower than a helicopter. at several times we had 6 to 8 objects in clear view and several times it appeared as though they were flying in v shaped formations. there was one instance when it looked as though 2 objects were going to collide and at the last second they both changed direction to avoid collision. the objects did not have any distinct markings or defined edges. as they pulsated they appeared as almost opaque.\r\n\r\nat first we thought possibly the military was doing maneuvers since it was friday night but then we became more skeptical as to what these lights were. i talked with a neighbor about ten minutes later and he felt it may have been the military flying drones. none of us who witnessed this event quite know what we saw and were in total dismay because we could not come up with a definitive answer as to what the objects were or why they were in the area.\r\n\r\ni have photos on my cell phone but to the naked eye they appear as small dots in the dark sky and i was unable to see as much as i did with the naked eye so they were no help. however if you want to see them i will supply them upon request. i have been looking to see if anyone else had the occurrence for the same area and time.

my eyes on the spot i saw it.  about 5-10 sec later the object blinked bright then off, but in a different spot.\r\n\r\namazed, i called to my friends to look up at it, wait and watch.  they too

place to get another picture when it took off what appeared to be straight up. and i never remembered a thing about it until this march when i was going through my camera photos looking for a spacific photo and  bam there they were. both pictures side by side and bits and pieces of that evening started to come back. i dont remember seeing much more than what my camera took. but there seemed to be a bluish haze with the object i figured it to be about 40 to 50 ft in with rather oval shaped with another half oval, about half as wide as the craft on the top. but like i said, i lost track of the whole experience until i seen these pictures nearly  a year later. here are the two pictures i was able to get.  and i have had  two other sitings since then, and i wander if they may be conected.
