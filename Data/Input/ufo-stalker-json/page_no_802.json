time): 00:14 on 25th (india time)\r\n\r\nduration of sighting:\r\n1st view: about 4 seconds\r\n2nd view: about less than 2 seconds\r\nit's approximate flight path was:\r\n-- from: inbetween west & west-by-south\r\n-- to\" inbetween east & east-by-north\r\n\r\ni entered an approx. 15 feet wide bylane and habitually kept looking up every now and then (that's how i walk all the time). a few moments later, at 19:32 hours, and at about 65º elevation, i saw a star-like white light moving very slowly in the sky - from left to right. unlike my 3rd extraterrestrial craft sighting (65067), this time i could also see its gray colored, rectangular, horizontal-platform type body, with no apparent external features. it looked like a 2d object with the star-like light at the center of its bottom. since its color was a uniform gray, something inbetween white & black, i could not comprehend the height of the craft.\r\n\r\nas usual, there was no noise/sound, no wings like an air plane, no blades like a helicopter, no smoke and it left no trail. it was high up in the sky and quite big - proportions were like 6 cm - x - 3.5 cm - and reminded me of a battle tank (without its barrel). it's size could have been similar to or bigger than a basketball court. if i remember correctly, due to too many thoughts in a very short span of time, its front left side appeared chopped off (curved inside).\r\n\r\nit's altitude might have been 500 feet or more, but it wasn't very high up in the sky.\r\n\r\nit was moving very slowly and it took about 4 seconds to move across the viewable sky from the 15 feet wide bylane, with three to four storied (floors) buildings on either side and went out of sight. i thought of running down the lane to take another look after turning right but decided not to. i continued walking briskly (my normal speed) and reached the spot (about 25 feet wide street - see image) where i thought i might see it again. i saw it again for or one two seconds and then it went out of sight as a tree obstructed the view of its flight path.\r\n\r\nthough the sun had set 40 minutes before this sighting, the sky was hazy blue and was still bright at the time of the sighting. the ufo depicted in the image tries to show the bottom view. there was no wind and it wasn't very hot at that time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

through the little pennsylvania town of wampum. we were each on our own bikes. he was traveling in front of me approx. 25-50 yards. it was a sunny clear sky day. it was in the afternoon, approx. 1500. we were starting to descend a small grade and a silver/grey, round, disc shaped object caught my attention and glided at tree top level over the road from east to west, as if slowing to land. i could not believe what i was actually seeing! it was not a quick movement or flight. the duration was long enough for me to get a good enough look at it to know that it was not an airplane or any other craft that i am familiar with. the flight path was between me and my friend in front of me. after the craft was out of sight, i sped up and pulled my buddy over. i asked him if he just saw what i did, and he said no. i stated that i was disappointed because nobody would ever believe me. he did believe me but didn't see it. i did not notice any windows. there was no sound or any lights to be seen. the craft appeared to be approximately 20-30 feet in diameter (it was almost as wide as the two lane road that it was crossing). it had a tapered dome on top approximately 4-5 feet tall. the whole craft appeared to be smooth but not reflective like chrome. there is an old limestone mushroom mine to the west of rt 18 in wampum, pa. this is the same location where i had my sighting. the mine is currently used for public storage. it also houses a  government/military facility. supposedly to store documents. there is a sign stating there is no trespassing at one of the portals and that you can be arrested for being there. it is currently called wampum underground commerce center. http://wampumunderground.Com/. i do not know if that is where the craft was going, but have always believed that it was even to this day. there have been stories over the years of a policeman in the 50's or 60's chasing a ufo on rt 18 in the same area and reporting on it. the mine was built in the late 1800's

night, not a cloud in the sky.  i was looking up at the stars, just gazing when i noticed an object moving from the south.  it'd didn't have a sound, so i knew it wasn't a helicopter, nor did it have blinking lights like a plane.  also, from the height it was, it appeared to be adjusting speeds to much to be any plane i know of.  it was a round object, and from the distance, appeared small in overall size.  it didn't have a tail, no wings, no cloud like stream like you would see from a jet. nothing i had ever seen before. i continued to just sit there, on the stairs, just watching it; wondering what it was. after a couple seconds or so, it just stopped in mid air, and hovered.  the object then suddenly came west for about 3 seconds or so, moving slowly, the just stopped again.  i was amazed bye what i was seeing.  here i am, a skeptic at the time, and seeing this; i was left speechless.   i hate to use this analogy, but it was like a car crash, i just couldn't look away.  the object then moves north for a few seconds, and then just hovers again.  after a few more seconds of hovering, it (well bye this time, i'm assuming they [referring to the pilot\\s]) moves east very quickly this time.  then after a few more seconds of havering, it starts rising slowly, and abruptly shoots off into the sky.  i have never seen anything like it in my life.  the ext day, there were military helicopters flying over our property.  this of course is nothing new to me, because i had seen them fly over our area my entire life.  however, it would be 1 or 2 times every once in a while.  a formation every now and then.  but what struck me as odd was that they flew the majority of the day, and not one flight was a single air craft.  looked like smaller helicopters, plus a couple chinooks, and an attack helicopter.

engineer who works on the development of general aviation aircraft so i typically will look at aircraft when seen). my sister is with me as well after we came home from a late dinner and we both have good vision. i saw two dim lights then appear near the aircraft, not implying they originated from the aircraft but in the same area which caused them to also catch my eye. the two lights about half the intensity of jupiter were moving rapidly from the north and became seperated but flying in parallel. the distance they were apart and the speed at which they were approachig first made me believe they were a low flying aircraft seperate from the original i saw. however, there was no sound associated with them. they were also slightly yellow and not red and green like aircraft nav lights and there were no strobes or red beacon lights. the light intensity of them was constant. only a second or so after seeing them i said to my sister what is that? look? she looked where i was pointing and they caught her eye as well as she verbally affirmed. as they approached quickly they went from flying in perfect parallel as it seemed and started to move closer eachother, dancing and overlapping but continuing in a quick north to south direction. it was difficult to tell their altitude at this point and would estimate between 3000' and 10000'. any altitude theirin would make them too quick to make a sonic boom based on being at various airshows and my professional judgement. when they started dancing together weaving in and out crossing eachothers path seemingly we both expressed our confusion at what they could be. my sisters husband who was also with us did not see them which is disappoiting but understandable due to their speed moving from where we were pointing and the distraction of other stars and that aircraft in the original vacinity. the lightings continued to dance together intellegently yet their speed and the rate at which they changed direction does not resemble any technology i have seen (especially that which wouldnt make noise such as missiles). it is possible their altitude was so high that sound did not reach us. however their paths do not make any sense for high altitude missiles nor their speed. the higher their possible altitude the more unnatural their speed would be. my sisters first thought was some sort of organism like a firefly but they were not flashing and she has never seen fireflies in her area. we looked around for others but did not find any. the fact they initially were flying parallel to eachother rules out fireflies as well. we lost view of the objects as they passed over the roof of a house maybe 20-25 degrees above the horizon. as they moved south their paths appeared closer to eachother (but still 'dancing') indicating to me their distance from us significantly increased during the 10 or less seconds from the time that we saw them to the north. the sighting made me confused. ive never not been able to explain something i've seen, especially in the sky. there were no reported rocket launches and i have seen many living in florida from cape canavaral both day and night. this was unlike any predictable trajectory a lunch to space would take. i am utterly confused at the moment which has caused me to make this post.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

my head and right on cue guess what?..A ufo!  a while back i started to become more intrigued by the universe as you do etc etc so my plan was to get a telescope and do a bit more research. i was in my garden looking at the sky imagining what im going to see with my telescope and pretty much said too myself in my head if i could see a ufo just now that it would be so unbelievable and if it was actaully real then show me!..Then almost immediately an orange ball i would assume was quite a distance away shot from my left hand view (e) to my central view (s). it hovered for maybe a few seconds there and travelled out my sight in front off me until i couldnt see it(s). thats my story!! just to add this may or may not be relevant but i gave up smoking probably not that long after the sighting(not because off it lol) and had a very very strange dream. i link the smoking too this as it seemingly is a cause of weird dreams when giving up. it pretty much consisted of me again standing in my garden looking to the sky but seeing all the stages off the universe happening. i already knew this was the case in my dream for whatever reason to clarify. it went on until the big bang where i definetely got a fright and woke up. all i can remember before the big bang and i woke was one of the stages was a square almost glass transparent universe consisting of stars. there was also an equation appeared in one of the stages and i wish for the life of me i could remember but i think there was an h and 2 in it!! anyway thats it so make of it as you will. cheers [name

south shore to the bridge at the tip of the north shore. as we were driving i was pointing out the old landfill to my girlfriend when i spotted a very bright red orb in the distance. i immediatly knew

see a pill if you were to hold it out at arms length.  i decided to get it on film.  i focused on the road for a second while grabbing my phone and when i looked back up it was

return when i went to bed i heard a strange roaring sound \"trrrrrrr\" like someone poked in a plastic strip into a pedestal fan. i ignored it and tried to sleep. in my dream i saw a strange levitating object just outside my window. it was black and it was somewhat between conical and triangular, it had lights at its edge in a sequence of white, golden and then a strange color(something between orange, blue and green i guess). i was alone in the room but i felt as if someone held my body, i couldn't move my body except my eyes. i saw something white come out, i felt it was alive, it was white and uneven shaped like an amoeba, it passed through the iron net of the window and came to me, it projected its body toward my head. meanwhile the sound of the object outside my window was already deafening loud. as soon as i felt its warm body part touch my forehead i woke up. this was strange. i still heard the sound but it was faint. i felt i could move, i rushed to the window and saw that object. it was somewhat 8-9 feet far from me (with the wall in between), it slowly went up and got out of my sight. it took it about a minute to totally go high enough so that i could not see it due to the upper end of the window pane. till then i reached for my phone to take a picture of that thing but the screen seemed to be glitched when i turned it on, it flickered and went off. i realized that the fan and the ac was also off. after it went away i looked at the clock, it was stuck on 3:34. after a few minutes, all my appliances started working altogether. next day upon asking in my locality, no one was found to have witnessed anything, but to confirm, i found the corner branches of a tree near my house burnt from the tip while still intact with the tree.","distance":"20
