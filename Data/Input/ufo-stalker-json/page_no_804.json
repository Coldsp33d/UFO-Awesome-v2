night sky. i was happy to witness a \"shooting star\" or a burning piece of rock entering the atmosphere. about 3:30am i noticed a reallybright light. what caught my undivided attention was when i noticed the light grow even brighter. not too far south was a cruise ship and its normally bright lights in the dark of night seemed dim in comparison to this surging glow of super bright, bluish white light. then the brightness settled into a smaller light, circular as a beam of light. the object just hovered until it slowly climbed diagonally upward. at this time a kind of fear swept over me, realizing that this was in fact a ufo, and alien life force. the ship, or bright light, lowered back to its original height above the ocean, then drifted slowly to the left (north). for a moment i thought i lost it, then i noticed a dim green light, in a horizontal, block pattern of green/black/green/black. the light appeared to be moving horizontal while the ship slowly drifted left (north), which also gave it the appearance of slowly spinning. this green/black spinning ship continued slowly drifting to the north, also seemingly outward into deeper space until it was out of sight. the event lasted about 15min. ending about 3:45 a.M. i was left in pure shock with an eerie chill being there alone, wishing someone would've shared that experience with me. as i viewed the buildings along collins ave., i saw several lights on and wondered how many others witnessed this event from their apartment. there were other airplanes around, hovering as usual waiting for entrance into miami international airport, and one cruise ship in the distance, yet this glowing, super bright, position changing, color changing object was obviously different. rising then lowering twice, once each while bluish white and when green/black moving pattern, this was no doubt an alien airship seeking out its hidden places in the ocean. after it left, i continued as planned fishing until sunrise. no fish were biting at all, and i wondered if the event had anything to do with that. i have not been able to think of anything other than those 15 minutes of time, witnessing such an event. i am both excited and eager to know how many others reported the same thing, and to gain the attention of nasa and other related agencies. please let me know if in fact there were other similar reports. i am confident there are,as this super bright continuous glow attracted the attention of others staring off into the dark horizon east of miami beach fla. i am also calm because i know it's only a matter of time before the world becomes more familiar with our visitors. i only hope the \"secret files\" kept by our government will be shared and matched with the many eyewitness accounts, enhancing our knowledge in preparation for future visits. i know the fear is chaos in fear from the masses, but with educated knowledge and truth we should all be able to reach a better, calmed sense of understanding. i will never forget this event.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

to film the sun rise. it was dark when i got there but on a near by hill i saw what i thought was a really big round turn signal. i did not give it much thought, as it became lighter i saw there was a huge plume of smoke going out wards and up. i watched it for a while (camera still recording it) i noticed two of what i thought to be a random couple watching the fire and the sun rise. one moving very quick back and forth like it was nervous one of them was much taller than the other. they where on a hill top to the right of me on the back side. i did not realize what was going on until i was about to leave. the sun was up and i could see very clearly what ever was in the middle of the smoke and fire took off shot of the hill at a 30 degree angle hooked a right at almost 80 degrees then traveled upwards path that just so happen to go right above me ( all on camera). it then started to dawn on me of what was going on. i looked down to where i saw the strange couple. i was wondering if the had seen it. that's when i knew i needed to get on my bike and get [item moved/cms/nd] outta there they had come around the trail and i saw what they where they had long what look like legs or more like long arms that bent out wards when they walked, they where wobbly when they took steps. they had short upper body as compared to the wobbly  legs or arms. i know what a human looks like from that distance they where much bigger. let me be clear about the legs because that all they had no arms. however the tracks they left on the ground where like huge hand prints very elongated palms 4 fingers one thumb on each leg almost two feet long. there is proof about the craft taking off there was a fire reported in the paper that put it self out before the fire department got there. on mt hamilton rd. that's like  packing a fire place full of wadded news paper and only half burning. i inspected the area and what i saw was very strange it looked like everything was flash burned bottles of beer (empty) where still in one piece, a pair of sunglasses where good except the lense was bubbled the aluminum frame was ok and there was what appeared to be a white residue on some of the area like an ash but different it was not from plant life. the area where the fire happen when i was riding back from mt hamilton at night cleared the fog from my visor and stung my neck a bit and still smelled like fire about a month after it happen. oh and its probably nothing but when i was walking around the side of the rd right before sun set i think they where coyotes above me but they had really long ears i saw the ears before i saw the heads. first i saw one then i saw about 8 more stick their heads up checking to see what i was doing. they where very strange looking coyotes if that's what they where. also when i felt the heat from the burnt out area there was a low resonance that seem to follow me and drown out the sound of my bike which is very loud. it seemed to follow me almost all the way off the hill. it felt like something hovering above me plus very strange gusts of hot wind pushing my bike around. i am not crazy, i don't make stuff up  i know others have seen what i am speaking of i talked to a few of the people that live in the areas around there and they can back up what i say, i have video proof and pictures. i know the area very active. i have also heard cow's screaming up there, seen lights  where there should be none been run off public land and roads by three different agency's. i do mean run off. please get back to me a.S.A.P.","distance":"21-100 Feet,

fl. just dropped wife off at [location removed/dr/cms], where she works. entered community through gate, and was proceeding south towards home on [location removed/dr/cms]. about 2 blocks from home, i observed at some distance an easily visible reflection off a silver metallic surface. at first i dismissed it as an airplane - i'd estimate it to be about 500 ft. in altitude and about 1/4 mile away, off to the south. when i was about one block from home i saw it again, only much more close and clearly this time. the object was nearly directly above me, only some distance from a 90 degree vertical from my location.  again the most distinct characteristic was the silver metallic reflection of sun light off the surface. the reflective surface looked rectangular. another portion of the object was dark in color and was either black or was not in a position for the sun light to reflect off it's surface.  i was sure now it was not an airplane, but it was similar in size to a small airplane but it made no noise.  stopped car and got out to observe object better. thought it might have been a large kite, that was quite high; perhaps it had gotten away from the flyer or perhaps the flyer was nearby.  i looked for a \"dangling line\" from the object but saw none.  i glanced around to a nearby open field but did not observe anyone in the field. looked back at the object - it was moving away from me in an easterly direction at an estimated 50 ft per second and appeared to be gaining altitude.  i got back into car, turned around in my driveway, and drove about 1/2 mile on road that was in the direction the object was moving (east).  parked car, got out and still could see the object in the sky off in the distance above the tree line. i got out my kindle notebook but by the time i got the guard off the notebook to take a photo the object was barely visible.  i managed to take four photos but by then the object was quite far away, however i could still make out the faint silver metallic reflection.  when i last saw the object it appeared much higher and was moving in an easterly direction.  in an attempt to catch up to it and obtain a closer photo i drove from the community and turned east onto state highway 44.  i drove east for about 2 miles, pulled off onto a side road, parked the car, got out and looked in the sky for about 5 minutes in all directions but could not see the object.  returned to my home. i was a bit anxious from the unknown i just witnessed, but knew i should report the sighting.

proceeding to skip across the sky to the east this time (lost sight due to trees). my cell phone video was not visible as you could imagine, but i did have the recorder on and i saved the 13 vid clips

around 3 am. the event began with me asleep in my bedroom, and we were awoken by the sound of three distinct bell-like tones. there were no cell phones in the room, and nothing we own made a sound like that. it was loud enough to wake us from a sound sleep. when we woke up, right after the bell sounds, a brilliant white light shone in the 4 small windows high up on the wall in our 3rd floor bedroom, and at the same time a massive white light shone through the 4 patio doors that make up the bedroom wall- they open out on a deck and the deck looks out on a canal behind our house. the light seemed to be as large as the house was wide- i estimate 60 feet. as i ran to the doors to look, the light seemed to move over the roof of the house, and as it did, a deep black shadow followed in its wake. as i watched, i saw what appeared to be a police car moving up the street- what was odd is that, this being a summer community, the homes are mostly empty until the season starts in june. you never see a police car just cruising- only when summer parties get out of hand and someone calls them. this police car was silent, and the lights on top were unlike any i have seen. police cars always have a light bar on top, with red and blue lights on the ends and white in the middle. this car had a circular flat disc of white lights on top, that rotated in a circular motion, and i thought how unusual it was- i have never seen flat circular white lights on top of a police car. the other unusual thing was that the \"street\" the police car was driving along....Was water. the canal. \r\nthis is the most recent in a series of various sightings over the past year, beginning with the sighting of a large. black wedge=shaped craft with 5 huge round white lights-moving silently and slowly over the ocean's edge about 20 feet over the waves. i made a report on that not long ago. i really wanted to get out of the car and flag it down, but i was unable to walk easily over the dunes. i seemed to be uncharacteristically uninterested in getting out of the car, however, and after we got home i was very disappointed that i just simply...Left- without staying to watch what it did- whether it went under the water etc. since then, there have been several events where brilliant white lights shine in our bedroom windows, usually between 3 and 5 am. these range from just the brilliant light to orbs which \"thin out\" into bluish discs before simple disappearing. they do not ascend. they do not \"leave\" - they simply disappear. \r\nthe event at the beginning of the report is the most recent, having occurred just 2 weeks ago and the only one where the craft/light seemed to actually move over the house and leave.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100
