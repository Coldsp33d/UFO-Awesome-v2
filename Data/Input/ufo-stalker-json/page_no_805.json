us. when i first saw it i immediately knew that it was a flying saucer. it had the appearance of polished chrome, bright silver. there were no windows or dome on top. it never made a sound. the craft was motionless as it hovered. it was not spinning or wobbley as some video footage of flying saucers show. my brother jumped off his bike and ran to my aunt's house to get my mom who was visiting there. i remember being frightened and amazed at the same time. i got off my bike but did not run.\r\ni stood there watching it for about a minute. then it took off in a northerly direction so fast that it appeared to vanish. by the time i could turn my head to track it, it was just a pinpoint in the distance, at which time i saw it turn and go straight up and out of sight. my mother did not make it outside in time to see it. but she remembers the incident and us telling her about it. i have never forgotten it and never will. since then i have had an insatiable curiosity of the ufo

gone to pick up a wood stove,  when we noticed strange lights in the sky. we stopped once to look at them then drove on. as we approached lac qui parle dam my phone lit up with a disturbing facial image scaring both of us. then my phone shut off. i felt strange. he suggested we stop on the dam and shake it off. it was a cool morning 40 degrees or so but either of us remembers feeling cold. the water at the dam seemed to be glowing or shimmering. we stood there watching it.We continued on still seeing the lights in the sky. decided to hurry to his house and get telescope out to have a closer look. after leaving the dam two deer stood in the road and wouldn't move. we thought it strange. then 5 miles from his home we were no longer on the same road. he was scared and used the gps on his phone to find where we were. took us about 20 min to realize we were near watson mn north of lac qui parle dam again. almost in the same place we stopped to look at the lights earlier.  i drove fast we were both shaken. as we drove near the dam my phone lit up with the face again. we drove faster joking if we should stop on dam or not. then the deer were in the road again. he was getting scared by the minute so i drove fast not stooping till we were at his home. we looked at the lights thru telescope and binoculars till we got cold. in the house i tried to calm him down by asking him what he remembered happening. then his dog began barking non stop out window where we could still see lights. few moments later the dog began having seizures. the lights disappeared. dog had about 5 seizures. i stayed till sunrise because my friend was so scared. we agreed to meet later that day and go back to see if there was anything that would have caused my phone to act strangely . he wanted to retrace our where we had driven and do it again to try and rationalize what we experienced. we found nothing and on a map there no way to explain how we had gotten way north of the dam.\r\nwe also brought the dog to the vet. they found nothing wrong.\r\ni have lingering memories of being taken with my friend and waking up on a metal table being held down by a metal brace. also something by my head which made my body feel like i couldn't move. there was someone by my head and 2-3beings by my lower body. they put a very long metal object into me and i must have lost consciousness. i remember seeing my friend restrained a few feet away from me with beings around him. i'm almost sure my friend was unconscious. i didn't have my menstrual cycle that month.\r\nthis wasn't my first experience but is one

vertically up, i saw a moving star (not a shooting star). it was almost overhead, slightly to my right and was the same size and brightness as any other star visible in the night sky. it looked like and moved at the normal speed at which manmade satellites move across the sky and took about 15 to 30 seconds to traverse the sky from above the center of the park until i could see it no

willoughby ohio when i noticed a strange very bright flashing light directly ahead coming toward us .I say strange because it was a sunny unclouded day.My wife noticed it also as she was driving. the object came toward us heading due west and intersected with us directly overhead heading straight down i 90 in the opposite direction .We could tell it was moving with great speed as at the same time a small  airplane was traveling beyond it heading north and it seemed to crawl by comparison.As the object grew nearer we could tell it was fluttering and what we perceived as a flshing light was actually sunlight reflecting off the underneath of the craft.It fluttered wildly enough to give us this reflection every couple of seconds. as it passed direcly over us. i would estimate the object to be 3 to 500 ft above us much bigger than a car . again i would estimate 25 to 35 ft in circumference. the object was a silver color ,a circular disk and we are quite sure that it had no wings or any apertures of any kind. it was a solid metallic fluttering disk that reflected sunlight as it passed over us. once i reached our destination i called lost nation airport which is located very close in lake county and asked if there had been any thing unusual on its radar but they said no.I also asked if anyone had reported anything unusual and again they said no.Both my wife and i know what we saw

noticed a very large light that appeared to be heading in our direction.  at first we speculated that it was a low-flying plane's headlight facing directly at us, for it was so bright and there were no green or red flashing lights.  however, as it got closer and eventually crossed the sky, we noticed that it had three large circular lights on the bottom of the aircraft.  we could not see the outline of the aircraft clearly, so we are not sure if it was round or triangular.  however, the three round lights formed a triangle, with the front one pointing in the direction it was going; it looked very sleek, as if could have been round.  come to think of it, it must have been some sort of matte black, because it was heading in the direction of the moon, but it hardly reflected any light, allowing it to blend in with the dark sky.  if i were to take a stance, i would take the stand that it appeared more to be in the shape of a saucer than a triangle.  this is because as the three lights passed by us in the sky, for a moment only two of the lights were visible, as if it had a belly at the bottom of it that briefly blocked out the far light.  it was really hard to see its shape, however, so it could have been in the shape of a triangle.  i am not sure how low it was, but from where we were standing, it was right at/above the tree line as it passed us from the north sky heading in the southeast direction.  there were multiple clearings that allowed for a completely unobstructed view as it passed us, and we are 100% sure about there being three lights at the bottom of it.  also, it should most definitely be noted that the aircraft made absolutely no noise, whatsoever.  n****** was with me the entire time, and can confirm what we saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

our direction then we saw the lights in a triangle formation and what looked like a black mass between them. i pulled over to the curb and rolled down my window...My daughter and i were shocked with disbelief because there was no sound from such a low flying object. my daughter kept saying \"i don't think that's a plane\", and i definitely knew it was not a plane or stealth bomber. i started to
