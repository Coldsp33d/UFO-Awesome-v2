never saw any colors,or navigation lights.  it traveled in a straight line from where i was, in a direct line towards the city of new orleans.  it was above the trees but lower than 100 ft. and never changed altitude nor direction. roughly the size of two limos side by side, i quickly stepped down to the front yard to continue watching this until it left my sight after 15 or so seconds. in the

disabled airplane (with a big, open area with several fields and ridges) - a place i frequent for its excellent observation of aircraft patterns from commercial jets flying out of nyc area, i was watching the air traffic with my binoculars and trying some ce5 meditation. \r\n(note: i have tried this a lot over the past year, and this day, like 2 previous times when i observed a ufo, was most

up!!!)\r\n\r\nanyway, i see what at first looked like any high altitude aircraft - a nondescript whitish, blurry shape, moving in a straight line. however, it seems to be moving slower than any of the commercial jets & private planes in the area i typically witness;  it is making no engine noise (nor noise of any kind); it seems to slow and descend, getting bigger, to where it looks to be the size of a quarter.  it is a white circle (perhaps a sphere/ spheroid), with two antennae-like rays projecting from the front. they reminded me of the v-shaped antennae from 'my favorite martian'! anyway, the circle moved slowly and steadily against the wind in a north bound  direction, so it was no balloon, and could not have been a helicopter nor any jet or aircraft because of the slow speed, shape and lack of sound.  also, the craft seemed to glow bright white while descended, but this might have been due to the setting sun.  it was a perfectly clear blue sky as well.  \r\n\r\nafter observing the vehicle move slowly across the sky, it seemed to ascend, getting smaller, then    continuing in a straight line north, gradually speeded up, and within seconds, was out of sight. the entire event was about 4 1/2 minutes.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:04:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

was approximately 7 pm and we were driving down read street heading towards attleboro, ma.\r\n read street is a rural street and there was no traffic at the time.. my mom noticed what looked like two headlights  in the sky coming down as if to land.  she immediately assumed it was a small plane  or helicopter trying to land in the empty field.  she stoped on the side of the road assuming assistance might be needed.\r\n as the craft got closer to the ground we were able to see that it was a disc shaped object.  the two headlights seemingly disappeared and there was one glowing light on the bottom in a small dome and little red lights all around where the top and bottom of the disc met.\r\n the craft flew over the field and towards our car it hovered about 75 feet off the ground 50 feet in front of our car so we could see it through the front windshield. my mom was a smoker so her window was cracked despite the cold weather and we noticed that it made no sound at all.   my mom was in awe but the 3 girls were voicing fear & concern.\r\n the craft edged over to our left above a stand of trees. the stand of trees was glowing from the light in the dome.  my mom put the car in drive and edged up a few feet, the craft mimicked her movement and also moved a few feet forward. about 5 seconds later it shot off over a nearby trailer park at an unbelievable speed and was out of sight within a second or two.\r\n at the time, my friend and i were 15 my sister 14. when we got home we were very upset, crying, etc. my mom called the police to file a report.  at the time attleboro, wasn't a big town.   to my mother surprise the police actually answered the phone \"ufo hot line\"  this was in the days before 911 when you dial the standard 222–1212 for police.   my mom went on to tell them about what we saw.  they said they were aware, have had several phone calls and we're looking into it. \r\n\r\n we saw this ufo on read street adjacent to the powerlines. my mom searched the newspaper the next day for any kind of information on what happened. the only thing she found was a blurb about a power outage on reed street due to a squirrel eating through a power

upwards at 45 degrees it was a hand width or two bigger (i'm 197cm). i heard no sounds other than normal street noise. i felt that it saw me see it.\r\n\r\ni stared at the now empty sky for a moment

several miles northeast of auburn looking for a route from highway 49 to highway 20 (or another dirt road) that would go all the way around the east perimeter of the very large beale air force base east of marysville. driving slowly through the low foothills on what i believe is the only road around that side of the base, we topped a little rise and before us and a little to the east of us, at an unknown distance, but seemingly less than 500 yards we saw two horizontal cylinders of unknown size, hovering broadside to us, just above the trees, close to each other, pointed slightly away from us toward i would say ene.  my impression was that the one in front and slightly above the other was moving when we sighted them, slowly, like a boat drifting in the water. for the duration of the less than one minute sighting the objects appeared stationary. we stopped for just a few seconds. as we rolled down this little rise, the trees before us blocked our view. we didn't see them take off, disappear or do anything at all. we just saw these two cylinders that didn't make any sense. they looked like very large shiny silvery metal fuselages with blunt ends, no wings, no insignia, no sound, nothing. \r\n\r\nmy immediate mental response on this and the other time i saw cylinders from my home some thirty miles east of this sighting was that this was some secret military stuff and it frightened me because beale was right there. we were driving along a perimeter fence when we saw them. we discussed it briefly and neither of us really wanted to explore it further. it was creepy. we didn't talk to anybody about it. didn't report it to anybody. i still think they are some kind of military deal. we both want to see any pictures or descriptions of other folks' sightings of cylinders. so far i have found only blurry images or streaks online.  i'm not certain whether we were in yuba county or nevada county at the time of the sighting. i would really like to see some pictures of similar things.\r\n\r\nwe are willing to answer any questions, but we really don't have much to add. that was the whole deal and we just drove on, arriving at highway 20 near the north gate of beale about fifteen minutes later. as i recall, neither of us mentioned it again until i told my wife about the sighting from our yard. i can't even say for certain that they looked like exactly the same thing, but certainly identical in behavior... hovering, silent, etc. actually, hovering doesn't feel like the right word. stationary. that's the right word.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":65184,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1534053,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05042015-0004","longitude":-121.58695469999999,"occurred":1367305200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1430757766000,"summary":"Through

about the same distance from us for about 30 minutes, no blinking, very pronounced in the sky, it stayed back in the same position about the whole time. i lost sight at about 30 minutes and i didn't see it leave, it just became more distant very slowly. it seem to stay at the same distance for most of the time, then it seemed like we were making distance on it before it became too difficult to see. i pointed it out to my husband who agreed it was unusual. it was somewhere in western canada after we passed over alaska.","distance":"Over One
