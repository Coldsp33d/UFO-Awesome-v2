year of when it happened. i am convinced by now that i could have been a baby in diapers and never forgotten this encounter. i thought i was crazy. i knew i wasn't. i searched for years of ufo's in my small town and all of a sudden..The ex chief of police who no longer lives there told his account of that night to our local paper out the clear blue. i have long since moved from this town as he has..But the overwhelming sense of relief to read this article and corroborate a story i've only recently told two other people (my brothers) is even scarier but truth affirming. it's out there and in our faces. trust that. as i'm writing this an earthquake just shook my building..Unsettling..I will proceed with my truth. \r\n\r\n\r\non that early morning this is what i remember...I was awakened in the living room of our home from having fell asleep with my brothers on the couch and  i was facing the wall on the outside edge..I looked back to see an enormous bright light out the picture window and suddenly focused on two to three figures that were grayish..Bulbish..Thinnish..And i think apparently surprised i had roused myself..The next thing i felt was an overwhelming, uncomfortable, vibrating throughout my entire being while they conferred with each other however quickly and then it was morning. i do know after that uncomfortable..And frightening for me situation..My dream sometime later that made me feel less uncomfortable was of a passenger plane that flew almost ground level to our house..I knew it wasn't gonna crash..And then it kept going over the trees and fields..Until last year i never breathed a word or forgot what had happened until i just up and told my brother..And cried with relief and awe for some odd reason..Until tonight..When i watched hanger1 on the history channel about buzz aldrin and the lunar landing..Typed in my town and ufo and the year..And this man finally talked to somebody. i also realized in talking with my brother about it again is that maybe i didn't just wake up. most likely i accidentally woke up when they were placing me back from where they got me. it's a possibility but i can't say for sure. ageing can bring out the truth in any number of people and i'm so glad he's talking now. this town was po dunk small...He is not lying and i am so glad!!!","distance":"20 Feet or

and started taking pictures of the moon to capture the rings around it. the ring around the moon wasn't showing up on my pictures which was disappointing. but, as i was snapping pictures i saw the previously  stationary star start to move slowly towards the moon! so, of course i started snapping pictures of it! (see time frame pics and video).  now, this pulsating star like object was too far up in the sky to be a plane or helicopter in my opinion. (and there was no sound- it was too far up! (note though, in the video, that the sound you hear is running water from a neighbors house. however, there is a whirring sound in the video- i don't know what it is or how it got in my video.) \r\n\r\nthe \"stars\" flight pattern did not at all match that of an airplane or satellite.  it moved towards the moon, then away from the moon at an angle or new trajectory, then moved closer in altitude towards earth (me). in the video, you can see where it comes nearer me and gets out of focus, as the video camera could not auto focus on it quick enough! at this point, i lowered my camera to look at it, as i knew it was closer, yet still way up there, but could not find it!  i suddenly felt a little strange inside, and immediately went back in the house. i cannot explain why i didn't stay outside, as i've seen a day time orb over my house and daytime multiple ufos far up above thousand oaks this year before without any negative feelings attached, - just excitement and awe. \r\n\r\nthe following day, i was not surprised to see a black helicopter and small white plane flying around. i have seen both aircraft following my sitings in the area before. (which is weird because i never reported the other sitings and assumed nobody else had either.)\r\n\r\nlooking  south from my front pateo, i can see the santa monica mountain range (a mile south). and in a straight line further south is the coast of malibu. there is a lot of air traffic here, so i am familiar with what planes look like in the day and night sky. \r\n\r\n i zoomed in on a couple of my photos and applied filters to the images to try to enhance the \"star ufo\".  the zoomed image looks capsule or bell shaped maybe. \r\nincidentally, my dog didn't want to hang outside with me that night and immediately ran inside after doing her business.

house for lunch. as soon as i sat down to eat i heard a loud roar, not unlike the sound of a military jet, but this was distinctively different. as soon as i stood up to go outside to investigate, my two year old border collie bolted through the open front door ( she had been outside) and got right next to me i got the feeling she was frightened. proceeding outside on the front steps i looked up to the sky in the perceived direction of the noise which by now was diminishing. the sun was at it's zenith and about ten degrees or so to the left side and below the sun in relation to the horizon is where i spotted the object. at the moment i first saw this thing it appeared to be moving. returning inside i retrieved my camera and ran back outside. the object was difficult to film as it's close proximity to the sun (from my point of view)destroyed the resolution.The first image i actually had to hold my hand up to shield my lens from the sun. i live in a remote wooded area with plenty of wildlife and it is great place for avian wildlife. the thing i noticed was that all manner of birds where flying about and appeared to be agitated, which i felt was unusual for the time of day. the object was viewable for over two and as the sun tracked further west the object become more viewable. as this happened, more aircraft appeared and where chem-trailing the sky below the object. granted the jets had been chem-trailing prior to the sighting, but in a north to south direction. when the object became more visible though, due to the sun tracking away, the aircraft started to chem-trail in an east to west direction as if to obscure the object. after about 2 hours of viewing, i went back to work in my shop, occasionally going outside to see if it was still there. it was barley visible for awhile, but then became obscured due to the high artificial cloud cover. the next day (monday) i told a co-worker of my experience and a close friend (whom i showed my images) to say the least both people where amazed. thursday, april 23rd,2015, the local weekly paper (the modoc county record) published a story of this sighting, written by a well known local ufologist, jean bilodeaux of cederville california, complete with a photograph of the purported object. i must say, it looks nothing like what i photographed. in fact, unless the image was reversed it was not even from the same angle as i knew where the object was positioned in the sky. the article concludes that it was most likley a product of google's \"project loon\". loon balloon indeed! \r\n\r\nthanks for reading my

united states army. during my time in country i had to be on the night watch on multiple occasions. i was using standard issued night vision goggles, never in real life before have i ever seen the sky full of stars and/or different flying objects such as fighter jets, helicopters, regular big cargo planes and military drones. i've also seen multiple small asteroids burning as they would enter the earths atmosphere. looking at the sky with nvgs was amazing. so over few months i learned a lot about how to tell a difference between objects in the sky. before i saw something unusual in the night sky, a friend of mine told me that he saw something weird in the sky one night, he said he was sure it was not man made or a falling rock from space.  i didn't belive him, i told him it was probably a military aircraft and it just looked weird because of an angle of observation. however, he kept strong opinion and kept explaining how different it was from any man made aircrafts or asteroids. so i ended up thinking that he really saw something unexplainable or a ufo. couple months later i was on another night watch. during the duration of the night i saw about 50 to 60 burning asteroids in the atmosphere, few fighter jets and one big airplane.Moreover, that night i saw something that made me a true believer. it was a bright glowing object, it didn't seem that bright without the nvgs, but with them on it was brighter then anything else in the sky at the time. the object was round, or at least that was the shape of the light it was emittimg. i couldn't see the shape of an actual object. the light would change from white to yellow/reddish to silver like. the object was not moving fast or in a particular direction. it was moving up and down, left and right and that really cut my eye. thw object stayed in the same area for about a minute to minute and a half. than all of a sudden it went straight up in to the sky and disappeared. it looked like a falling star, but instead of falling it was moving straight up very fast, and just like that it was gone. couple months later i have witnessed one more object that looked just like the first one. from  my experience, i can definitely say whatever it was it was nothing like i've ever seen before. those two accounts made me 100% believe in ufo. over a year and a half later, i had a very strange dream that felt very real, im not going to go into details, but in a dream i was taken up to the craft and something was done to me and other people, i kind of saw the part of alien agenda and the part of a future, but thats a whole other story and if you are interested to hear it, let me know and i will gladly tell tou about it. i just dont know if that was just a dream, a message or an actual event, but after i woke up, righr away a was thinking about the strange objects that i witnessed in afghanistan. so thats my strange story.\r\n","distance":"Over One
