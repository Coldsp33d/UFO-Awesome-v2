mobile sky app on my phone and was out on the back deck with my sister, who had also downloaded the same app on her phone. after looking for a few minutes we both stepped back in the house. i had seen a bright star in the northwest sky just at twilight and decided to step back out onto the deck in an attempt to identify it.  as i stepped out onto the deck, something to my right, in the southeast horizon, caught my attention.  at first, i thought it was another star that had just become visible but i realized it was much larger in size than anything i had been looking at and also that the color was much different.  it was a bright distinct yellow/orange orb or oval shaped object, brighter than any star and it was very low on the horizon moving directly in my direction. it seemed as if it was out quite far but as it moved forward, in a slightly northern direction, it was closer.  as if in a blink of an eye, a second object, exactly like the first, appeared slightly to the right of the first object.  as they got closer to my position, the orbs, or objects began to become larger and brighter.  i called for my sister to come and look at what was in the sky.  i called her several times more, and after what seemed to be forever she came out and observed the orbs which were getting closer and brighter but seeming to change color to a more orange/red, with less yellow, yet just as bright.  these objects made absolutely no noise.  as they got closer, their shape began to become more round than oval. although i have never seen one, for some reason, i thought maybe these were chinese lanterns that people describe as seeing.  my sister went back into the house to get her camera and as she did a third and then a fourth light appeared, all in a straight line, exactly the same distance apart all moving very slowly towards us and continuing to angle away in a straight line.  they seemed to be slowly moving and yet hovering at the same time.  my sister came back out and i pointed out the other new objects to her.  she started to take some digital pictures using her phone.  i then turned on the video camera on my phone and began to film.  as the objects moved slowly towards us i noticed they all slowed to almost a complete stop and speed up together.  the distance between them remained a constant.  as the got closer, there was still no noise at all.  then as if by design the straight row of four lights began to somehow turn straight upward with the first object leading the way.  they ascended upward to the north, on an angle and just ever so slowly lift up and away with the first object dimming and fading, getting smaller, with the distance between the first object and the second becoming greater. the second object followed the first in the same manner as well as the third object.  however, the last remaining object stopped moving altogether and just hovered above for what seemed to me to be forever but was actually maybe 30 seconds.  none the less, it did not move in any direction.  then, just like the rest, it just sped straight up into the night sky and it was gone.  this whole episode lasted maybe four minutes.  my sister took several digital pictures.  for some reason, only one photo was in her gallery. the picture that was remaining has no color.  it is as if it is a black and white photo.  strange.  i did manage to get 3 minutes and 20 seconds of video.  the video seems to be bouncing around quite a bit.  i thought i was holding pretty steady but i guess not.  i think the movement of the objects and my inexperience in cinematography might have something to do with it.  i am going to download this video onto this report.  i am not very computer literate so there are no guaranties. if they don't load please contact me and maybe i can submit the file some other way. in any event,  i don't know how i feel about what i encountered this evening. it was so bizarre that if it wasn't for another witness i'd wonder if i had just imagined the whole thing.  somehow, i feel like what i witnessed tonight was not of this world. \r\n

explain. i was in the car with my father and a friend of his going down hwy 268. it started off as a strange bouncing light, i was in the backseat of a vehicle so the driver saw it first. he pulled over into the parking lot of a closed gas station, we all then exited the vehicle and began trying to record with our phones. from what i could tell my phone would not pick up the strange light so i ended it and began snapping pictures. i took 4-5 pictures as close together as possible. it changed colors and shape. the last one ending in a rainbow type shape. fading from an orangish red to a green. to our eyes we saw it almost take on the shape of a person glowing green, orangish red, and white. at one point a smaller, paler orange light seemed to come from it and to run around it in almost the blink of an eye one time. i later discovered my video indeed captured this ufo. that's unidentified flying object, as i really am confused about what i saw. what i know is, to my knowledge, this isn't any craft we're aware of that currently exists in our reality. it jumped, it seemed to change course without stopping, it bounced and it changed altitude. going up and down very quickly. after taking the last rainbow shape picture, my grandmother called me to see if i was safe at home. something she always does. i'm telling her about this strange thing we're seeing and the light gets the brightest it has so far, turning completely green. at this exact moment my grandmother began speaking gibberish, at first i assumed she thought i was joking and was playing along and acting goofy. i quickly figured out when i could hear panic in her tone she wasn't playing. i began yelling \"mamaw! mamaw! what's wrong?!\" she attempted to answer me but it was all mushy and sounded like it started with an em sound. i alerted my father to this and he was like \"let's go to her.\" she lived near by. i actually didn't connect the light and this until after what happened next. my grandmother has cancer, and i actually thought she was have a seizure from this. my dad grabbed the phone and attempted to yell \"we're coming mama!\" instead the mush she was speaking now came out of his mouth. it sounded like it started with a jay sound. i really hate that i can't recall what the \"word\" was. at this point, though, i was in shock and panic. i actually felt this sickening feeling before my grandmother called, and spoke her mush. this thing that was in the sky felt wrong. it was like a knot and nausea in my stomach. i felt sick. when we began driving toward my grandmother's home, located off of hwy 268, it seemed to be following us. almost playing with us. i also got the feeling i was a bug being sucked into a bug zapper. amazed and also full of fear. my grandmother was ok upon making it to her home. she has never had the gibberish happen to her before, and she didn't know what caused it. the light outside was being watched by my father and his friend. they said it just got dimmer and dimmer until it seemed to move far away. they could no longer see it. i was fearful of it, so i wished for no further contact. i thought i wanted to see something like this, until i saw it. i'm afraid. i also would like to mention that as we were heading toward my grandmother's house we saw multiple cats and dogs on the side of the road, not just in one spot. as if something bothered them. it also seemed to make time feel different, slower or faster. i'm not sure. when i say it messed with electricity it was like our body's \"electricity\". that's the best way i can describe it.

smoking a cigarette when she just looked over in the ufo's direction. it was something that just normally wasn't there. when i first saw it, i immediately suspected it to be a ufo because it was too big to be a star, it wasn't a planet because the moon was behind our house, and it was hovering so i knew it wasn't a plane or anything like that. as we, my brother, my mother, and i, stood out there the object didn't move but it was pulsating and hovering above the trees. i came back inside after first seeing it to get the binoculars so that i could possibly see it better, maybe see what all there was to it. but they didn't help, just made the object seem blurry but with just looking at it with my own eyes, it was sort of clear. it didn't move for a good five minutes after we all saw it. but about a couple minutes later, it began to slowly descend behind the trees so it became difficult to see it with the binoculars but i could see it with my own eyes. my brother says that when he looked at it through the binoculars it was like an oval/cigar shape. but when i had looked at it, maybe two minutes before he had, it was like a teardrop shape.\r\nsince i had my phone, i pulled it out and opened my flashlight app and began to make it do the pattern the ufo was doing. it was a steady one, two, three, one, two, three. and as i was doing this, the object began to glow brighter and seemed to turn a bit. so i believe i made some sort of contact with whoever or whatever it was.\r\nthis isn't the first time we've seen something over around in our area. my mother mentioned that she has witnessed something similar off and on for the pass four years. she says that when she has seen it in the south to the southeast, it's been moving slowly until it begins to fade away and then it's moving faster. but every time it's been near our home, north/northwest, it has hovered.\r\nduring this recent sighting, the object didn't move until about ten minutes after the initial sighting. and it slowly descended behind the trees until i just couldn't see it anymore. i'm honestly a little...Scared now that i've actually witnessed a ufo and now that it has been around here for the pass four years...","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

faster.Before the flash/explosion the object was only really noticeable by it's trail and low altidude but after the flash it seemed to be much more bright and reflective, the whole thing was intact after the bright flash, it went over the treeline, going behind the ridge line that lies parallel with the highway and out of my sight. i only observed it for about 10 or 15 seconds, and it was too far away to truly ascertain what it looked like. it could very well have been a military craft or missle, but the bright flash and increased visibility of the trail makes me think otherwise, my country is not at war and we are far from any testing range, the only thing it looked similar too was an air bursting meteor, my experience with such things are limited but it does not seem it would have been that bright. i am also hearing loud noises that sound like far away explosions, have been since i arrived at midnight. instantly i was overcame with excitement at seeing the object, i'd

construction projects. but this was not acting like a stationary construction light. it was just way too bright. so i went outside and had to pull out an 8ft ladder to see it above the treeline.It stayed in that first configuration until helicopters arrived then it seemed to get agitated and changed from a sphered to a raging vortex. the vidcam lenses only portrayed it as a sphere or vortex, yet to the naked eye it appeared elongated and morphing into all kinds of elongated shapes. the moon, later that morning, also exhibited the same vidcam look. and it moved in the sky , bathed in an eerie brown to ochre colored cirrus . it was not the moon and made me feel nauseated,.Confused, panicked and tired. after 5 hrs of filming it, i went to bed.","distance":"Over One

happened in 1993 while taking an evening stroll in october along with a friend. as we walked south ( towards lake erie ) in our subdivision, we noticed something in the sky over the lake. we assumed it was a plane with a burned out red light, but found it odd that it was not flying across the sky. it hovered over the lake for over ten minutes...We stared not knowing what it was. then, all of a sudden, the green light/object, descended down, then up again and out of sight!!! we were terrified. \r\n\r\ni called the rcmp still thinking that it was a small aircraft that crashed into the lake. i gave them my contact information telling them that i was not high, not drunk, not tired....About one hour later, they called me back to inform me that they had no information about any aircraft in the area. i was very scared.  i then told them that i was glad to report this in the event anyone else had witnessed it and they would have a record. \r\n\r\nthis has remained unexplained to me for many years. my family and friends have known about this sighting. i searched over and over again and wondered who could / would hear this story. i knew / and know that i did not invent this/ i know what i saw. this light should not have been just hovering over the lake. that was not normal.\r\n\r\ni am finally relieved to be able to find this venue to post. maybe others have witnessed this too.\r\nwe still live in the same house and i have never witnessed anything like this again.\r\n\r\ni thought at first that it was a flare....But a flare doesn't last that long...And it doesn't hover...And it doesn't have a lime green, shimmering/glowing colour.....And it doesn't descent and then ascend and take off !!\r\n\r\ni am not going crazy. \r\n\r\nthank you for permitting me to post this strange

40 acre parcel in central dane, county, wi. it was the first day of hunting during our time period. we hunt on private land and no other hunters are allowed on the property. there are scattered homes in the area but there are no visible farm lights or yard lights where we hunt. we have hunted this property in the past and are friends of the owners.\r\nwe checked our watches and turned to walk to our hunting hide outs. my step-son noticed a light 400 yards distant traveling across the open and elevated farm field from ne to sw along the neighbor's fence line. the trees along this line are scattered and had no leaves on them at the time of the incident. the relative humidity was very low that day in fact red flag warnings were up for fire danger and there was no dew present on the grass, our cars, boots etc. a crescent moon was low on the se horizon and skies were clear with only thin alto-cirrus horsetails beginning to form in the early morning sky. winds se and light at 5-7 mph.  we were walking due east across the corn field from our cars. the car headlights were not on and the cars had been tuned off for about 12 minutes. looking across the field stubble he commented that it looked like someone else was driving in from the neighbor's side toward us. the light reached a gate opening in the fence line which is 25 feet wide and it turned through the opening toward us. height above the ground was 10-12 feet the entire time. the light was bright white at center and fuzzy blue to blue-green at the outer edges and pulsed as it traveled. it also changed shape from round to oval as we watched it come toward us. the light maintained its altitude but started to zig-zag south then north then south, then north. we thought it might be a very tall jogger? then thought it was a person on horseback? this left then right sequence lasted for a count of 8 seconds. we continued to observe and walk toward it closing the distance between it and us by about 150 feet determined to find out what we were seeing.We were concerned that there might be other hunters on the property that  were un-aware of our presence and thus creating an un-safe situation.  by the count of 9 seconds the light simply vanished-gone. there was no sound. i then took a flashlight out of my pocket and shined it in the direction of last contact expecting to see something out there reflecting back- nothing.\r\nmy step-son and i spoke very little, trying to make sense of what we had just seen? we agreed to continue the hunt but to text each other once we got set-up at our separate hides. we saw nothing else related that morning. at 10:00 a.M. we agreed to meet on the property and hunt together. we made a pact to not discuss what we had witnessed while we were still on the property. we decided to write down our own individual recollections as soon as we got back to our own separate vehicles. our individual recollections, distances, descriptions, were almost identical once we exchanged our written notes.\r\n\r\nafter my step-son left the property i went back out to the field and paced off the distances from where we first observed the light crossing the open gate entrance to where the light vanished in mid field during that 8 second count time frame. i am a trained forester and distance measurement is something i do everyday. the object traveled 135 yards in 8 seconds. that is 400 feet, which is 50 feet per second, which is 34 mph. there were no reflective posts on the property such as snowmobile trail markers. the property is not posted with trespassing signs of any kind. there were no tire tracks in the adjacent field or field we were on. no footprints left by any four-footed animals such as a tall horse. there was no hard evidence on the ground. no burn marks. no fabric, nothing reflective. \r\n\r\nwhatever we saw for that 8 seconds was there and then simply vanished without a sound or a trace. i have been in the outdoors all my life. i have camped, bushwhacked, canoed, slept out in all weather, all seasons from the arctic ocean to the florida everglades and i have never had an experience as this that i cannot explain.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:08","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

around 10-11 pm in north salem, or on the date of april 29th, 2015. i looked up and noticed what i thought was a small faint satellite far in the distance, i've seen many of them and don't think anything of them. it looked extremely high up in the sky, higher than a normal aircraft would fly. i watched it for about 3 second and to my surprise the faint light faded and was replaced with a pulsating bright red light, and it looked bigger now than it was when it was just a white light. at that point i had gotten my brother and friends attention and tried to point it out to them, i saw it stop abruptly in its tracks and change back to the white light after about 5 seconds of the pulsating red light. my brother and friends did not see it in time as i was still attempting to point it out to them and they were trying to find it. what looked like either a plane or a helicopter passed underneath it while it was stationary, and i was able to use that as a marker to point it out to them as it passed underneath. however, by the time they saw it, it was of course back to a faint white star, and it had stopped moving. it literally only looked like a star now. i don't know if they believed me, but i know what i saw. i am intelligent and educated with no history of hallucinations or mental illness. anyway, i watched it intently for about 2 minutes and it did not move. over the next 5-10 minutes i glanced at it every now and then with the same result. no movement. i know it was not a star. and i don't believe it was any aircraft either, it looked much too high in the sky. not just a little too high, very very high. i would have tried to get pictures or video of it, but my cellphone camera is not advanced enough to even photograph the  moon at night.","distance":"Over One

looked like a silvery spherical object that appeared fuzzy as though it had heat ripples around it.  it was far enough away that if it had been a loosed balloon it should have been much smaller and
