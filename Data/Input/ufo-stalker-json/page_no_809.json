work at 2:30am and coming back to the shop. i see in the sky just right to the moon a big white light slowing down fast, i can see at the back like white grey flames. or it was the effect of the slowing down of the object. the object did a u-turne fast and go down in a straight line, like if it hit a wall and fall down. it's not the first time a see these white light go down, it's the third time. usually it's in the air like a star and fall in a straight line.\r\nbut this time it move from left to right stop fast make a u-turne going down in a straight line. i was surprise and try to estimate the distance. i think it was between 2 and 4 miles. the object was 1/6 the size of the moon that day, so maybe between 30 and 100 ft maybe more. it was white grey, not hard to look at. not fuzzy, but round clear cut white grey. \r\ni work at night, and on the road, so i have to look quick and have quick reflex. it was just less than a minute but there is no doubt in my mind, something or somebody make that thing stop and go down. i did not see a light on the ground, police or firemen. it was the night and to far the pin point exactly were it was.  \r\nthis thing, like the others lights, i have to insist so that you can understand. did not fall like a meteorite gradually on a long distance by the gravity and disperse in the atmosphere. \r\nimagine to see it falling down from  5000 feet in a straight line to the ground in 3 secondes.\r\nnot going left and right, but a clear cut white grey light, that fall at the same speed if you drop a ball to the ground. \r\nthe other night, i dont remember the date but it was in march 2015, when a arrived home, it was 3:10am. there was, far in the night sky, maybe 30 000 feet, a similar light, white grey clear cut light pulsating. it was ovale in shape and was going straight over my head . 2 secondes intervals between the pulsating. it was big. i look at it 2 minutes before the clouds hide it. \r\n","distance":"Over One

1dimensional triangular shape with unequal length sides--as if rotated towards \"edge\" surface of triangular shape. observation was from inside house or on porch. objects caught wife's attention when pulsating bursts of colored light seen with naked eye, then with binoculars. ufo similar to description as viewed on hangar 1 programs. amazed to view so many objects simultaneously (appearing at varius altitudes and rotations during \"orbit\" for several evenings and will continue to look for them. sound seems to only be interference picked up by wiring or electronics in and near house and barn (also has electrical wiring)--sound continues after electrical panel main switch has been turned off. sound seems to be similar to that of 1000s of insects in a meadow during summer--also in sync with the way the lights pulsate. we took photo with ipad camera but noted interference (snow-like as on early years of black &white tv viewing) before cable/satellite. lost sightings only due to

they circled me and cackled. they always make me nervous alone, so i put the tripod back in the car and grabbed my bear spray. i picked up a large stick and smacked it against a tree three times, so hard the last one broke the stick and the sound reverberated up and down the mountain valley. the coyotes continued their encroachment so i started making lots of noise and howling at them. around 10 pm with the dogs still bothering me, i looked out in the western sky and a star like light that was orange appeared to be traversing nw and it got bright orange and faded out. excited as always, i waved and said \"hi guys\", like i always do, sometimes the light blinks in response but this time a sound, like and electronic pulsating force invisible force was headed directly at me. it came over my head and i ducked in primal fear, i can't really describe the wicked way it sounded, it sent fear from the bottom of my spine to my brain, adrenal glands dumping fully. i was dumbfounded at the sound that just flew over my head. i ran in a small circle and tried to open my car but fear made my hands weak and dumb feeling, i couldn't open the hatch! feeling watched i spun around in the direction of the moving star and exclaimed \"was that you guys?\" and there was a flash of orange that sent my hairs erect and my heart pounded in my throat! the star like light ten went slowly left then right and i clenched my bear spray, feeling very exposed and very alone. i watched that light in silence, with the dogs cackling again, when the sound had come they fell dead silent. i watched the light move back and forth for a half hour then retired to my car and watched the light from inside for another half hour before i fell asleep. i have never had such a personal experience. i am

squared off at a slight angle, flattened out with a square coupola everything but the bottom was burnt orange. i didn't feel any particular emotion. i have had sightings since the mid 1960's. have been a coast listener since the 1st part of 1988. i saw one other that was the same shape only much larger. it was at dusk and a dull grey and two orbs came out of it and then returned. i called my son out but by the time he saw it it was just starting to rapidly assend. he's not really sure if he believes in them or not. this is the 1st time i have reported a sighting. very few people take it seriously and i gave up on talking about them. i have listened to and enjoy your reports. i am a disabled vietnam vet on a limited income so am not able to make a donation although i certainly would if i could. i lived with the lakota sioux on the pine ridge reservation with the red cloud family for 5 years and learned so much about their beliefs. ufo's and aliens are very much a part of their and every other native culture i've been introduced to. feel free to contact me if you like. keep up the good work.  harry  p.S.  i try to keep a camera with me at all times now.","distance":"Over One

sky was sort of dark blue. there were no stars to be seen, as it was cloudy (rained earlier but not at time). when i first saw it i felt something like a knife stabbing into my heart, i ran outside. i was very excited!! that was when the object was closest. it was sort of saucer shaped with a dome?? on top. i watched it go horizontally and then disappear in a blip. it then reappeared more to the west after about 10 seconds. it was hovering. i ran inside, yelled for my brother and told him to grab his phone. we went outside and it was still hovering there!! we both filmed it as it was stationary. it then slowly disappeared/disintegrated as you can see on the videos. our mobile phone cameras arent really good, it looked way more orange and bright (you know this from taking pictures of the moon!!) we were both in awe. one or two other people were watching from their balconies too. the object was hovering for about 2 minutes but it felt like forever. after that it reappeared once more, way more to the west and went straight up and disintegrated. we didnt see it again, and it looked further away when we saw it last. we are still very excited. my little brother is scared now. the second video was taken with an iphone so it's not as good but if you zoom in you can see it. we were able to film it when it was hovering.","distance":"Over One
