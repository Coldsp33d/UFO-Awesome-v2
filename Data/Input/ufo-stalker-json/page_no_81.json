of blinking lights in the south eastern sky, they then formed into a line and passed over us in a north westerly direction....They blinked and appeared to move in unison, as if they were part of a single craft however we could see stars around and in between, each individual blinking light....This experience was unnerving enough that we called 911, the dispatcher informed me that we were the fifth caller about these lights and they had an officer with a visual as we spoke...The dispatcher also said they were going to make some calls about this and would contact us with any information they learned...We have yet to hear back from them......  it took this line of lights 20 minutes to pass over our location....As they got further away they appeared to resume the cluster like formation which i believe was actually caused by a difference in altitude of the individual objects that couldn't be distinguished while it was overhead.....I observed the distance the line itself covered  and timed a jet the next day to see how long it took the jet to cover the same distance that the line of lights took up in the sky.....It took the jet 1 minute and 45 seconds to cover the same distance that the line of lights took up in the sky.....Based on this, i'm guessing the line itself to be 10+ miles in length.....As they passed over there was no noise at all, we were trying to take pictures and video and were experiencing a lot of trouble with our camera shutting off....We also experienced trouble with our land line telephone when we tried to call 911 the phone went dead and had a constant high pitched mono tone beep that lasted for 4 minutes even after hanging the phone up on the base several times.....The brief footage i was able to capture shows only the part of the line that fit in the cameras view.....From end to end, it stretched over a huge portion of the sky.  i do not believe this to be any sort of man made or operated craft and i believe anyone who seen it would agree with my assumption.  i am willing to undergo a polygraph concerning what i witnessed and would love to hear any further information you may obtain from any other reports on this incident.  i will also send the video footage i was able to get when i'm contacted by an investigator.

o'clock at night and i was meant to be home by 9.\r\ni started to walk home but stopped to look at one silent bright star in the sky, but it wasn't a star. the the light slowly appeared to get bigger and then split in to three stars. \r\nsuddenly i remember looking about and i was raising up above the roof tops! \r\n\r\nthen, i was standing in the exact same position, when i looked at my watch it was 12oclock. 2 hours had passed. my watch was working still, but even though i thought i was floating previously, i assumed i was imagining it and went home.\r\n\r\nluckily my mum was a sleep but i was able to sneak through the back door.\r\n \r\nsince i was a child, i have always been able to see ghosts, hear and sense them, since i had that experience i have had much weirder experiences, including seeing in to the future.\r\nwhich quite a few people have experienced first hand from me.\r\n\r\ndespite my dyslexia and the bipolar, ptsd and anxiety i have developed due to my child hood being disrupted by a violent step dad, i have kept going. \r\n\r\ni have always believed something has been done to me, as i think i have had more children than i have.\r\n\r\ni have two girls, one super smart but not so practical, the other very visually creative and logically practical.\r\n\r\nboth fast learners.\r\n\r\nboth slightly gifted with future sense.\r\n\r\ni'm only 37 and have already started in the direction of menopause. \r\n\r\ni feel like i should have more children. and i love babies, it's like i miss babies. \r\n\r\ni even still lactate which the doctors can't explain as it's been happening since i was 15.\r\n\r\ni believe i had a miscarriage at 16, and a confirmed one, one month before i fell pregnant with my eldest.\r\n\r\ni fell pregnant again 16 months later.\r\n\r\ni've not used the pill contraception or a condom since my eldest was 3 years.\r\n\r\ni haven't been pregnant since, but my periods have been long, short, heavy ect every one is

the second floor of my house and was getting ready to go to bed. \r\ni had just moved towards my curtains which had been open until this point. when i saw an odd light outside, i originally thought it had been because i had my bedroom light on, but i turned the light off and it was still there. my room looked out onto a building site of a nursing home. the light was slightly covered by the corner of the building site which is when the light came round the corner. \r\nat first i thought it was a pixie or mythical character because i didnt recognise it. it looked rather small from the tall window i was looking through.\r\nthe thing was looking around as if it had lost something, and i thought i was dreaming so i knocked on the window, ever so quietly, yet it looked up at me. we stood looking at each other for many moments, with these huge eyes.\r\ni then stepped back from the window, to see if i walked back if it was still there.\r\n\r\ni must have stepped back from the window for about a minute, to refresh my mind set when i looked back outside, it wasn't there anymore. so relieved i shut my curtains and turned back to my room and it was on my bed.\r\n\r\nmy bed was positioned in the middle of the room and my door was shut. i didn't see how it had got into my room but it was standing on my bed. it didn't meet my hips in height but had a very large head and skinny body. \r\n\r\nit was whilst i was starring at it, that it pointed at me and then back to himself/herself. that was when it came over to me but it was walking weirdly as if it had injured itself. \r\n\r\ni was sitting down at this point as i was feeling faint, i dont whether it was the alien's doing or the fact i was seeing something that shouldnt have been real. \r\n\r\nit touched my over my heart, it was so cold i couldnt physically feel the being but i coudl feel the energy, the coldness and then it walked up the wall and through the open window, which had been closed before.\r\ni ran to the window to see two beings walking in the opposite direction than i saw it before, walk through the short hedge and disappear just before crossing the road. completely disappear into thin

yard in the picture.I wanted to film the sunrise.I left the camera there filming away for about an hour.When i played the film back i noticed a beautiful beam of light to the left of the sun..It looked like a multi colored parachute and the beam seemed to be coming from a disc shaped object near the sun.The disc shaped object is visible for around 30 seconds and is then covered by clouds although if you zoom in on a still image you can see it behind the clouds for some time.The beam of light stays visible for around eight or nine minutes before it too is covered completely by cloud.The object does not appear to be moving.At first i only noticed the beam of light and i thought it was coming from the sun and maybe reflecting of the clouds but if you follow the v shape of the beam it narrows to a point that directly leads to the disc shaped object.It seems to be projecting out (narrow to wide) from the disc not the sun.Because of the glare of the sun i did not notice anything odd until i played the video back.I just thought it was a beautiful sunrise and worth filming.My partner and i both sat and viewed the video.It looks amazing.
