(i know it's very weird)..\r\n\r\nthen it moved in a straight line and stopped near/over my friends house, and turned itself off/vanished....Now i have to explain, i was on top of a hill where you could see for many miles across the countryside, so although the house was another 6 miles away i could still see the general area..(if it was daytime i could have seen her roof). also it moved that distance so fast, that i said to myself, if it had moved even a fraction faster my eyes wouldn't have kept up..Out of the whole experience, which only lasted 10-15 seconds, the speed that it traveled was what shocked me, it was so hard for me to accept that something could move that fast...I still cant, its been 8 years and now that i'm writing this my mind is blowing all over again as i'm picturing it move.\r\n\r\n...A few months later, i had regular dreams where i was met by two 6.5-7ft tall blueish people(fairly stereotypical looking guys actually), their eyes where big ovals, except weren't black like tv says, they were just bigger versions of a humans eyes..White with big blue iris's, they where amazing to look at actually.. the first time this happened, they asked me where i was from and i said i don't know to which they both started laughing, a really gentle laugh. one said that they knew i was going to say that.. then i asked where they were from and they said two planets which i wont mention because i probably sound crazy enough already..They lead me somewhere and said i must remember what they where about to show me...It was a plaque on the wall with four 3d shapes sticking out of it, which i knew were letters, even though they where more like sentences(i never said this made sense)..I said ill just go get something to write them down with, and woke myself up trying to get a pen ....\r\n\r\ni managed to write down two of them....Which i can explain, one was like two squares diagonally and the other was a weird ''a'' i spent a while trying to figure out what they meant and i managed to find one online...Its called lambda(lowercase)''&#955;'', its a greek letter... it has a few interesting meanings if you want to wikipedia it..\r\n\r\nthere have been more visits over the years but they stopped when i was about 22 but i can only remember them for a few minutes after they happen..","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":65070,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.8983017,"location":null,"logNumber":"IE-04292015-0019","longitude":-8.483195700000001,"occurred":1186229040000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Cork","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1430347406000,"summary":"White glowing, looked mechanical, looked solid but also had the effect that it wasn't solid...Hard to explain","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"EST","timeZoneName":"EST","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/65070_submitter_file1__ufo.png"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2825,"locationName":"Cork, Cork","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:40049"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Oklahoma City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At 11:45 on 4/29/15 i was smoking a cigarette on my friends deck when i noticed a flash in the west.Then a white hash mark looking object just appeared in the north sky about a mile from my location.It moved slowly from west to east then moved quickly to the  northeast. it didnt fly out of sight it just disappeared from view in the northeast sky.The whole incindent lasted less then 2 minutes.","distance":"501 Feet -

south-west-by-south, and happened to look up (straight ahead) -- as usual :-) .. yes, it was a different bench this time. the entire sky had a cloud cover of 2% to 5% density and the blue sky was easily visible through it.\r\n\r\ni saw a milky-white rectangular object - like a thin horizontal line - in the sky, slightly to my left. the color was similar to what the moon looks like when visible in a clear sky during the day time. it was quite far away and high up in the sky, at 50° to 55° elevation from my location. from the distance it looked like a 1 mm thick and about 1.2 cm horizontally long, milky-white, rectangular line/tube. so tiny - blink and you miss it. it moved from my left to right and the direction was approximately east-south-east to west-north-west.\r\n\r\nit didn't have the distinctive features of an airplane flying far away in the sky. also, airplanes normally don't fly in this direction because if they did, they would have been flying almost perpendicular to the airport runway (approaching from the right side - at 90 degrees to the flight landing path).\r\n\r\ni don't know if it was a drone/uav/ucav/rpa (e.G. predator drone). i am not aware of drones flying over delhi. if it was a drone/uav/ucav/rpa, i don't think it would be so easily visible from a great distance. if it was a drone/uav/ucav/rpa, and if was closer, i don't think it would be flying over the area of the president's estate / central delhi / parliament house. again, i don't think a drone/uav/ucav/rpa would fly directly towards the airport. of course, air force planes are also stationed near the civil airport, but i feel this would not have been the ideal approach.\r\n\r\nmoreover, since it was moving roughly in the direction of the setting sun from my point of observation (sunset was after 48 minutes), it neither glowed due to the sunlight nor it reflected any sunlight and maintained a uniform milky-white color.\r\n\r\ni later learnt that such crafts are known as cigar shaped

that it took on a shift shaping form. i then grabbed the video camera to try and get some footage of the thing. i had trouble finding it at first in the monitor. after 50 seconds in the video, it shows up in my camera display. it then headed south east, and maintained the same altitude of what looked to be at least 1 mile up in elevation. i could not really see much detail of the object at first because i was trying to just keep it in the display view as i recorded. after viewing the video, it was behaving in an organic manner. which is to say that it had legs that contracted and protracted. it had what appeared to be an oblong head, terminating into a type of tapered point at the top. it appeared to have a tail or vestigial tail that would show when the object would take a \"standing\" position. the object looked to be following over a nearby freeway (8 east), and in some screenshots, the object appears to be looking down on the ground as if observing. i have tried to

we all agreed that it was there. \r\n\r\n-when i first noticed it, i thought i was imagining it. how could a star disappear then reappear right in front of me? i watched it through the mounted binoculars changing colors between blue, white, purple, and pink at high speed, it kept pulsing. \r\n\r\n-it seemed to stay motionless, the problem was that the altitude was just high for any of us to make out exactly what it looked like, from our vantage point we could see that it may have been hovering and possibly moving but just can't say for sure. after about 5 minutes of viewing the object as we were all trying to get a look at it, a bright flash filled the sky in the location of the object, it looked like it shot with an incredible speed and was gone. we were traveling north, the object was northeast of our northerly heading. our speed was approximately 15 to 20 knots. \r\n\r\n-the three watch standers at there post reported that two similar objects had come out of the main relatively stationary object and then rejoined the main object.\r\n\r\n-during my time watching the object cic (combat information center) was trying to get a radar lock on the object with the nato sea sparrow missile directors. the directors (which are radar directors, fire control radar) kept trying to lock onto the object then it would drop back down to the horizon, the os's (operation specialists) trying to drive the director back there again. every time they would drive to get a lock the lock would fail and the director would be driven back down again. it seemed to me that the object was overriding the directors drive control or that the radar receiver was being over powered and being forced by internal programming to protect its receiver, (to get away from the source of the electromagnetic radiation) it could have been over-driven by the object being to close but more than likely the object was jamming the radar. i can't say weather it was jamming the object passively or actively, just that the radar was being jammed.\r\n\r\n-after the sighting i checked the spn-43 and sps-49 radar in catcc neither of them had a radar return, although at that altitude the chances of a radar return are very slim. \r\n\r\n-i tried to report it to my chain of command, they laughed at me and said that we didn't see anything. we probably just excited, i didn't expect that reaction especially when cic reacted the way they did.","distance":"Over One

expecting to see it dissipate entirely but to my surprise it shifted it's course, instead of being in a seemingly straight line as it had been since i first saw it, it gently tilted as if changing trajectory slightly more north away from west which it was heading. i took my eyes off it twice to convince someone nearby who was not able to locate it but i was able to locate it two more times after taking my eyes away from it and the sky. it was heading northwest then slightly corrected to north just over about 5 miles west of the strip and had a steady continuous pace at no point did it stop or hover, it was more of a steady slow gliding very steady not erratic like a bird. i don't know depth/height so well enough to describe its height but the motion of movement being so steady was almost reminiscent of a blimp and the best analogy i could give for the height at which i saw it as well. it appeared to me as if something transparent was disturbing or creating cloud/steam/vapor that rolled off the point of an invisible object, the vapor it was either creating from heat/cold mixing or disturbing in the sky was the only thing i actually witnessed. i heard no sound that i perceived to be coming from it and saw no lights","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":65054,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.811019699999996,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04292015-0004","longitude":-116.41565899999999,"occurred":1425784500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1430298722000,"summary":"Large invisible triangular object created vapor mist in shape of a long boomerang in night sky","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":52,"locationName":"Nevada","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:40062"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On my way home from work i noticed a very bright and low to the horizon orange light. when i arrived home i told my husband and we went outside to observe the light, we watched about 25 minutes while it hovered and did some aerial moves. it would get brighter then dim out. go higher then lower,side to side. while i was on this site checking the map for ufo activity, it faded out or flew away, either way it was gone. super awesome while it lasted though","distance":"501 Feet -
