noticed a large bright white light in the sky. at first glance it appeared to be a star but did not have light emitting from all directions, only just below the object. as i began to take more notice the object began to move west bound along with the flow of traffic, to the right of the horizon. it could not have been more than a hundred feet above the trees parallel to the hwy. its large bright light from below began to dim and surge in and out of brightness for the next minute before completely disappearing, then re-appearing not two seconds later to the left of the horizon. im now passing rt29 towards the mall in columbia and the object begins to climb towards passing aircraft. im now seeing the object in and out of the passing trees but it is still to the right of the horizon. the object is almost out of view before another bright white light surfaces above it now and is what appeared to be hovering in place (now passing under rt108 @ roughly 10:35) surging the same as the previous encounter. both objects now began climbing and were in plain view, they began to dim simultaneously before cutting out completely and disappearing. i made sure to take note that neither object had blinking or colored lights, and that a small dome shape was slightly visible at the top of each object. no noted noise from either as they were too far for me to hear. pinned location is where the encounter began, dayton area is where it ended. no lost time. just unexplained phenomenon.

out to them i'm 100% positive it was a star, plane, or anything of that nature and to get a perspective of movement we witnessed a plane flying in same area with the normal white to red lights to assure us it was a plane. then we witnessed a helicopter flying in same direction but herd the helicopter so again confirmed it wasn't a helicopter.  it made us feel uneasy because we are not ones to believe in something that is unexplainable to us. we are not your ufo typical believers so it is completely out of character to try to find out how to report so making this sighting and report is something we felt needed to be explained. we lost sight of object because of a huge direction change from spot position to a climb in altitude.  then regained visual 10-15mins later with it\"( orb) but this time having a second object similar to first but smaller under the original object which confirmed our skeptisism that we previously had with all out panic and that the object not only

the dvr, my sister and i had to go the gas station for cigarettes. this is like 12:50am, im pretty sure of the time and you'll see why. we exited the door, now my house sits up pretty high. there are 16 steps to walk down  b4 u reach the sidewalk so my view of the sky is pretty good on a clear night. so we walk to the car that's across the street. the car is parked so that the passenger side is on the other side walk. ok, my sister's the driver. so we're walking to the car, backs to the house, i go to open the door and see it streaking above my house for just about 3 seconds. i ask to my sister, \"did you see that\" she didn't because her back is towards the house and she's opening the door.    the best way i can describe is that it looked like a upside down trident, but more crescent moon like. it had a small tail to it. i lost site of it because it went behind my house. so we drive to the gas station, and on our way back stop pass a friends house. she goes in, i'm sitting in the car with no music so i can hear and see anyone maybe creeping up to the car tryna carjack us being the neighborhood i live in. i started to hear propellers in the distance coming so i looked at the clock and it was 1:03am. then i turned around in my seat bcuz now i can really hear it now. look out the back window and see the helicopter lights fly by. bout 2 minutes after my sister comes out, get in the car and we go back home. i tell my sister  \"why when u was in the house a helicopter was riding this way\" and i pointed in the direction it was going. we get back to the house, i tell my brother what happened. about 15 minutes total, from us coming back in the door, all of a sudden we all heard like 2 helicopters flying by. i said \" see y'all, i told u i seen a helicopter when we left\", we all jus listened to them fly by. so i asked my brother is there some way i can find out if someone reported seeing anyanything. he gave me this website and here i am.","distance":"Over One

grayer in color than previously white, within a second, each end turned silver or flashed and it vanished. this wasn’t an airplane changing its course or if it did, it turned on a dime and must have went immediately south and out of my eyesight.  nothing fell towards the earth, no smoke, just gone. after a minute or two of looking south, i went to the front yard to tell my wife who was working in the flower bed. as we stood looking at the contrails both merged and at about 3:20 pm they were forming a cloud drifting east/north east direction. i put the kite away. looked on the internet and found this site.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":65013,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.7702557124843,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04272015-0019","longitude":-90.65932998380924,"occurred":1430172600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1430181317000,"summary":"Silent airplane leaving contrail turned into silvel cigar shape then vanished","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"63376","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Saint Peters, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:40132"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Falls Church","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approximately 10pm on 04/26, i stepped out on my patio.  as always, i look up in the sky to check out the weather.  if i didn't look exactly where the object was, i would have missed it.  it was a dark, gunmetal grey boomerang shaped object and flew directly over my condo unit from east to west.  i first noticed it heading directly towards me from the east about 1 mile.  it took all of 10-15 seconds before it flew directly over me and out of sight.  my heart was racing.  \r\ni've always been interested in ufos and i'm certain they exist.  i've always wanted to see one, until i actually saw one.  \r\ni felt this overwhelming dreamlike sensation that i was being noticed as i was watching the craft.  i felt as if i kept looking at it, it would stop and come around. to try to further explain, i've had dreams before where i saw a tornado and i just \"knew\" it was going to come towards me, and it does.  it's almost the exact same feeling i had.  i can't say anymore about this other than i always thought i'd be excited to see one, but in fact, it was terrifying.  if the government is covering it up, i think i know why now.  it's horrific to see something like this.\r\n\r\nmost importantly...If you had any reports of the same object, i'd really like to know so i know i'm not the only one who saw this.\r\nthanks,\r\n{witness name removed/dr/cms]","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":65012,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.84563803566406,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04272015-0018","longitude":-77.23458690754367,"occurred":1430110800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1430179067000,"summary":"Boomerang shaped object seen flying east to west","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"22042","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Falls Church, Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:40133"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":811}
