missouri. every month or so i'd go down for the weekend. its a touristy town with trail riders, rodeos, camping, canoeing, and swimming. if you like horses, woods,outdoors & no people to bother you, it's ideal. it was relaxing & a break from campus life in columbia. on a weekend there in summer of 1983 (approximate), my family & i was watching a movie on saturday night. there were six of us. during commercial break my brother went out onto front porch but never came back in. i went out to see what he was doing and he was looking at what we thought was a car with one headlight parked at the top of our driveway about 50 ft to the left of our house. we thought they were parked because we didn't hear the motor running. we decided the light was too big to be a headlight & we were looking through trees at the wooded area on the side of our yard too so it wasn't a clear shot view. we went back in to tell our dad there was a truck or something with 1 headlight \"parked\" on the hill of the driveway. he came to door & said it was probably doc, who had a cabin at the far end of the driveway, like a mile up into the woods. we asked why would he be parked there just sitting. my brother & i went back onto the porch & noticed it had moved farther down the driveway closer to the yard. we watched it and we couldn't see it move, like clock hands it gained ground & was getting closer but we just couldn't see it moving. it got to edge of road & moved off road & thru tree until it got about 20 ft away. now it was passed the trees & we had a clear view of it. it was about a 3 ft high & 3ft wide complete circle of white light. an all light globe? circle? orb? but it didn't shine a beam, it was all light and all we could see of it was the front. it was bright enough that all we could see beyond the edges of it was the background darkness  of a small fence & the trees on the other side of driveway. it moved until it was 10 ft in front of us. it never did anything. it was so subtle. i guess if it shot up in the air and flew around the house, we would've been more scared, but it just didn't \"seem\" like it was moving or anything even though it was getting closer to our house. all the family came to the door & looked at it 2-3 times in the 45 min to an hour from the first time we saw it. we would go back in and then a few minutes later someone would go see how close it was. then when we went to look to see if it was still there & how close it was. thinking back on it, it terrifies me that it got that close. if it would have done something fantastic, it would have been so much more of an incident, but it was so subtle with the way it moved. i keep watching these \"ufo\" shows to see if anyone has ever seen anything like this & i would know they were truthful because i saw that same thing. another important point needs mentioning about that is where our house was located. it was out in the country so far, our nearest neighbor was 3 miles away. local people said that no one could live on that ridge. there was abandoned cabins up at the end of our driveway which was about 1 1/2 miles long. on the highway where our driveway started was an abandoned house & my family bought a cabin & house that had been abandoned and fixed them up & that's  where they lived. people had bought property to build on & even attempted to build on that ridge, but for unknown reasons, they were always abandoned. this is true & there were 5 other people who witnessed this. in fact, i'm a little afraid bringing this up for fear of something happening. i've wanted to say something about it but worried about being labeled one of those people who think they saw a ufo. we, my family have never brought this up with all of us together but if asked confidentially, they would talk about it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:50:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

noticed an orange colored dot just above the horizon and off to the right of the moon. i grabbed the binoculars i keep in my bedroom and looked at it. the object was dim at first and then it began to brighten to a brilliant orange color, then it would dim again, it even turned a reddish orange color, it did not change color quickly but rather slowly. at first the object was stationary but then i noticed it was moving in a northerly direction but very slowly, i would estimate about 50-70 mph. i live near an airport and have seen many aircraft flying above and arround my house, so i am familiar with how fast they move, this object was moving way too slow to be an airplane, even slower than a single engine propeller airplane. the object was approximately 15 to 20 miles away, arround the nampa or caldwell area. the shape of the object kept changing from an orb to a cone to a triangle with the corners rounded off. after about 15 to 20 minutes of watching it i lost it behind some trees. the weirdest thing was, i saw it again on sunday night at about the same time and it repeated the same pattern of flight, almost an exact repeat of the night before except this time the color changes were not as brilliant as the night before, nor were the shape changes as radical. like i said before i live about 2 miles from the airport, which also has a military airstrip next to it, so i know what all different kinds of aircraft look and sound like. in my opinion it wasn't,t any kind of aircraft i know of.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

the day before, who was in phoenix on monday, april 6th. on monday, when the secretary of defense was scheduled to give a speech at the university in tempe, followed by a meeting with local \"military officials\", there was only one cloud in the sky that day. that lone singular cloud was parked directly above the university area of tempe. i remember coming out on my lunch break and seeing what struck me as a suspicious looking cloud over on that side of town, much like the ones you'll see in the photos i've included here. as i've done before, with another cloud i suspected of concealing a ufo, i raised my cup of coffee in a gesture of salute and waved. it seems i received a return gesture when i came back out for my afternoon break. from that same area of sky, a white orb appeared from high in the southeast relative to my position. it appeared to be both traveling due northward, and descending at the same time. eventually it bounced, leveling off and then ascending in an easterly trajectory away from me. this eliminated any possibility that this was a balloon, and also suggested that my earlier greeting was being acknowledged. the last time i waved and toasted them, i ended up

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It's hard for me to talk about this. i'm an oil field worker, and also a truck driver. i haul crude oil for a living. my job takes me to remote places out in the middle of nowhere. i drive out to oil wells, test oil, take samples, and if the oil is good, i buy it, load it up from the well and put it in my tanker and drive it to an offload facility and sell it. i have a class a license. i've been hauling crude for over three years now in colorado, wyoming and nebraska. two summers ago i was out in a remote part of colorado, a place called the pawnee grasslands, right on the colorado and wyoming border. there is nothing out there, just open space, and a lot of oil wells. the closes towns were grover colorado, and maybe herford wyoming. it was close to sunset, i was out at an oil well called the \"critter creek 03-04h\", its an eog oil well. i had pulled up, went on top of the tanks, took some samples, they looked good, so i then hooked up to the tanks and started load up. about 5 to 10 mins later i was sitting in the cab of my truck, which was facing west, when i saw something coming over the horizon. at first i thought it was nothing, maybe a plane or something. as it started to get closer though i could tell it was not a plane. i could see then that the object was round in shape, but could not make out a color yet because it was coming at me from the west and the sun was shining behind it. i started to think, maybe its one of those big balloons filled with helium, the kind u might see floating at a car dealership. quickly i dismissed this, the wind was blowing hard at the time, pushing down from the north to south, which is very common for this area, yet this object was not affected by this cross wind at all. it stayed on a fairly low and flat course headed straight for me. i'm a grown man, but i began to get a little nervous and even a little freaked out by this thing, but at the same time i was excited as well. i started saying out loud to myself, what the heck is that, what the heck is that? by this time it was getting very close too me and my rig, i could see that it was blue in color, just as i could kinda make out the color, the pump on my truck shut off. my engine was still running on my rig, but my hydraulic lines that operate my pump for loading crude oil, called my pto, shut down. i had my window down and was still sitting in my rig at the time, i said out loud, what the heck?? i grabbed my cell phone and hopped out of my truck. the object was almost on top of me at this point. i quickly ran with my phone to the ladder to climb on top of the tanks, which are 20 feet tall, to get a better view. when i got to the top on the cat walk the object was coming over head. this was the closes i ever got to this object during this hole experience. i could see that this thing was perfectly round. i mean perfectly round! it was a bluish gray in color, if that makes any sense, kinda dull. it was very strange because the sun was setting, the sky was all orange from the sunset, yet this thing was not reflecting any of that color or light at all. not shining, nothing! it was almost like tho object was not flying through the air, but the air was going around it?? there were no lights, no windows, no lines on this thing, nothing. perfectly round sphere and smooth. there was no sound at all, in fact, i remember it kind of getting more silent as this thing passed over me. i remember thinking, pull out your phone and take a picture. but as soon as i said that to myself, all at once i thought, no, don't worry about it? this really bothers me when i think about it, that's not like me at all to not wanna take a picture? i mean, that's why i grabbed my phone. i can't explain why i didn't take a picture when it was coming over me? i know that i was freaking out a little, scared a little, but still, it makes no sense to me at all why i thought that? i stood there in awe as this object passed over me making no sound at all. i just kept thinking to myself, what the heck is that? it never slowed down or sped up, it never moved off of its course. i watched as this object moved over head and steadily move to the east and finally disappeared over the horizon. this is kinda the weird part that i haven't even told my wife, i was on top of the tanks watching this thing when it passed over me and disappeared over the horizon. the next thing i remember after it moving out of sight is standing next to my truck with the pump running. i looked at my gauge on my tanker and i was almost fully loaded up. i think maybe i was in shock or something and don't remember walking down the ladder from the top of the tanks to my truck. even stranger, when i finished loaded and put everything away and was getting ready to leave, i climbed in my truck and found my phone sitting on the drivers seat? i'm sure i had it in my pocket? i think this thing got me all worked up and i must have been in shock or something because i don't remember getting to my truck or getting into my truck prior to standing next to my pump? i've told only my wife about this object, and never about me being in shock. when i told her what i saw, she told me never to tell anyone else about this and to just forget about it. for the last couple of years that what i've tried to do, but its always in the back of my mind, what did i see that day at sunset? what the heck was that thing? the best i've ever been able to come up with is maybe it was some kind of military object. after a lot of thinking and exploring and reading, i have found out that there is a military air force base east of there and that this area where i was at and the object was heading is full of nuclear missile silo's. maybe its some kind of defense thing or something? i just don't know? i will say, it feels good to finally tell someone my story. it's been hard for me keeping this thing to myself.I thank you for this website, as i feel a lot better telling someone. if you have any idea what this thing was, or anyone else has seen anything in this area similar, please let me know. if you have any questions please feel free to contact me through my email and phone if u feel necessary. again in sorry that i can't pin point that very day, but i know the date provided is close. thanks again ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

shining effect got my attention. i didn't know what they were, so i kept looking at them while i got my cell phone and started to record. the objects were coming from the east (atlantic ocean) with a constant nw direction; they were shaped like cylinders, like oil barrels or soda cans. with the sun in front they shone no lights or anything; it was just reflection off of the body of the objects. they had no wings or any other part. they made no noise, and they keep the flight formation until i lost sight of them in the distance. unfortunately i turned my phone sideways while recording and lost sight for a moment when they were right above me (or in the closer part of the sight). they kept flying in the nw direction. i never noticed speed changes, but one of the objects was getting a
