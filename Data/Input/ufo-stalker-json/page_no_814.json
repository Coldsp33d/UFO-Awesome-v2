night sky outside the window and began looking out the window and saw a really bright light moving very quickly around the night sky for at least 2 hours, there is only one light that can been seen from the place we were sitting (close to zero light polution on a mostly clear night) and it was the closest house about 5 miles away on a different mountain, the craft seemed to be looking at something with a spotlight like projector pointing in all directions the spotlight had narrowed at times into a bright beam, it was atleast a mile away and was also observed with binoculars and a telescope. it moved from one mountain top to another (that were measured to be 3 miles apart) within a matter of seconds, it also descended below a mountaintop and back up to heights far greater than the mountain tops within seconds, the craft was shining its lights at the ground and seemed to be searching or studying its surroundings. we (26 yr male, 62 yr male and 58yr female) had all watched this happening for at least 2 and a half hours in awe. i was very anxious and worried about what this could be. i have seen helicopeters of all types in the night being in the military and this thing was just too fast. it travelled across the sky at speeds that seemed unbelievable. we lost sight of the object when it darted up and into a cloud formation. after looking at the area that the object

suddenly alone in pool and it was like i was deaf, everyone including my mom had gone inside this room that had a sliding glass door so i could see everyone but total silence. i then focused on the object and felt scarred it just hovered there about 200 ft high but i did not try and yell or call my mom. then it just went up and suddenly disappeared and instantly the sound came back on and everyone was back outside. i never said anything about this till a couple months ago while talking to my mom and surprisingly she said some stuff that freaked me out, she said she saw this object from the room she was in but was paralyzed and actually saw me going into this object. i don't recall any of this, but the fact that, i don't know it's crazy. anyway i have had this same nightmare my whole life and it makes me physically sick/scarred, i don't know what the nightmare is i wake up instantly but can never remember the dream but am scarred to death, i assume it has to do with this incident

edge was almost on top of me coming from the direction of the river barely above the trees.There wasn't a sound not even a leaf or cricket.I just stood there in disbelief as it slowly moved directly above me and stopped hovering.It moved so slow i believe about at about the speed of a person walking.I could not move.I watched it move over the barn across the fields suddenly a flash and it started traveling away at a right angle faster than anything ive ever seen.The closest comparison was like shooting off a pop bottle rocket.I ran into the house to see if my wife had heard and seen this too.I could not believe she was sound asleep.The noise in the beginning was much louder than standing next to the rr tracks.No one could sleep through that!The strangest thing is i saw no lights yet the sky was brighter while it was there like the sky just before dawn once it was gone the nights sky went back to normal.It was like i was frozen yet felt at peace.I looked up at the clock and it was about 4am but was outside only about 5 minutes.Since that night i have high pitch ringing in my ears that changes in volume and pitch constantly to this day.Ive never told anyone of this.For years i could picture this thing but couldn't really remember say or even write this down but for some reason the memories keep coming up more and more but very foggy.I have a feeling like there is something im

the film to the rocket scientist. the film was also seen by d* studios who said they could not imitate it.  after the guy was called a huckster, a nutcase, and worse, to try to save his reputation the

the suburb of oak cliff dallas tx 3rd house down from 1723 michigan street on the north side of the block standing in the street facing north, when i had a strange feeling of my arms like static electricity looked south west and observed a large disk shaped object grey in color and looked like it was all one piece not riveted together with a smooth flowing surface , it was very large as stretched from my friends house over to the large oak tree of the neighbors house that had a small vacant lot then a large 2 story house on the big lot, with a very large oak tree, at least 3 story's tall this was way bigger than the goodyear blimp that use to fly at the cotton bowl football stadium the city it seemed to dwarf the houses as it expanded to the city street on the other block behind my friends house.As i watched i asked myself is this real i said to my friend are you seeing this, his reply in total amazement yes i see it. i and friend was excited,i asked my friend to go get his brother as no one would believe us, and i thought to myself if i had not looked that direction i would not of known it was even there! i waited outside starring and observing the craft, i was amazed that the craft had apparently had engines maybe 15 as it looked like jet engines in full after burn with yellow and blueish green flame emitting approx 15 to 20 feet down, and trying to rationalize this as i had observed aircraft from the sac basses i had visited with my sisters husband who was in the air force, many times earlier in life, this was no helicopter and how could this be with no sound, no sound what so ever, and was so silent eerie silent, but for air displacement no smell  i told my friend to go get his older brother, who was 18 at the time, his big  brother and my friend came out to the street, and i asked the older brother, do you see it, as my friends brother did not notice it at first, i asked him again in a more excited tone do you see what i and your brother are looking at! my friends brother seemed to be in shock as he held his mouth partially open in a most unusual way, as he was  acting like he did not want to acknowledge that the object was right there, but he did see it and he was startled. he stayed there a minute then returned to the house, i and the younger brother stayed there observing the grey metallic object that seemed to have no ridges or cornering as most aircraft are built, not a balloon or helicopter that we have seen, then the engines quit and it began moving off slowly in a south western direction then disappeared immediately, this moment in time is nothing but the truth, and now that i am retired from gov service i am compelled to tell these facts, i have served in the us navy and worked with aircraft and i have never seen another aircraft of any type do what this disk shaped behemoth did, and i do wish i could see another it was amazing.","distance":"101-500

noticing an entity behind me that seemed to stretch down the whole stairway. it was a brown color, and had long appendages. i couldn't make out a face because i was startled from what i can remember. it was a peripheral experience. upon noticing the appendages, it seemed to force its long fingers into my left pectoral area, then my left bicep area. it didn't hurt a lot. since that very day, i've noticed that i have absolutely no pectoral muscle and half of a bicep on my left side. i cannot absolutely describe why i literally first noticed this on that day. i've always been told that i was born that way. but personally, i must deny that. i've never mentioned this because it all seems so strange and unbelievable. the reason is because after it happened, i remember not caring at all until later on in life when i replay the images in my head. i literally walked out onto the front porch with my family to enjoy some watermelon that my granparents had bought. i noticed absolutely no trace of a ufo or anything like it, unless i just can't remember it. i'm not sure whether i can call it an abduction, but i did lose track of time, and it's pretty haunting actually. it seemed so fast, yet, over a stretched period of time. i feel that this is a very unique case, although, i could be wrong. all i know is that i have finally found a place to explain my experience without being judged, but taken into scientific perspective. thank you very much, i hope this could shed a further light into the world of unexplained phenomena, and especially hope to hear from you to share your opinions and ideas. thank you for doing what you do.","distance":"20 Feet or

(it was definitely not two planes flying in sync with each other, which my rational mind was trying to make work as an explanation.)  it floated very smoothly in a straight line from the right of my line of vision to my left.\r\n\r\nit was dark in the area between the lights.  though i seemed to be able to see “sky” between the two rows of lights, i don’t remember actually being able to see stars.   it was like a large rectangular piece of glass floating by with lights at both ends.  it seemed to be flying parallel to the potomac river on the virginia side (crossing route 301), maybe heading toward northern virginia or washington, dc.  size?  i wouldn’t be surprised if this thing was at least 100 meters by 300 meters or so.    \r\n\r\nmy reaction?  \"what the hell is that???\"  awe and curiosity.  i felt a little giddy and excited.  i also felt some frustration that i didn't have anything with me that could take a photo and that i had no place safely pull over for a better view.\r\n\r\ni kept expecting to hear a loud engine, but never heard anything at all.  i even opened my car window because i felt like i should be able to hear it.  but i heard nothing but my own car.  about 3-5 minutes passed from the time i noticed it approach from the front right of my view until i couldn’t see it anymore on my left (trees in the way).  \r\n\r\n\r\nvery interesting!\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":64920,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.2664512,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04242015-0024","longitude":-77.18078419999999,"occurred":1429852200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1429940715000,"summary":"Large rectangular object with lights in front and rear flying low near the potomac river, king george, va, across route 301","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"22485","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"King George, Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:41106"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Waynesville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On april 23, 2015 my oldest daughter had been in our hot tub approximately 15 minutes waiting on me to join her. we live in a very rural area on a mountain without street lights, or other interference with the night sky so it is not rare that she and i sit in our hot tub with the lights off to gain a better view of the sky. this particular night, once i joined her, she said that she had seen the craziest looking lights in the sky. she said that they didn't blink like an air craft, or fall like a shooting star, but rather flew, in a straight line, about the speed of an airplane, only without sound. she said that she had first seen one, and like a minute later a second moving in the opposite direction. i dismissed her at first thinking it was a plane or a meteor. there had been a meteor shower that peeked two nights prior to this occurance, so i said that it was probably that and we should watch the sky to see if we may catch a late glimpse of the meteor shower. we sat there talking for only about 10 minutes watching the sky, and she smacked my arm and said, \" mom there's one\". it took a second to find it, but once i did, i was astonished at what i was watching. it did exactly what she said. it was moving a bit faster than what an air plane appears to move, it did not blink, and it maintained a straight path and never wavered. we were watching this one and she said \" see here comes the other one\". sure enough in the opposite direction another exact light, moving the exact way, was traveling through the sky. i watched the first one and she watched the second one until we could no longer see them. we layed back in the hot tub looking up in silence and in like a minute another one was moving across. low and behold the second one, moving in the opposite direction, appeared. i witnessed this three times, my daughter four. so in total; i saw six lights, she saw eight. it went on for approximately 30 minutes and then when i finally got my husband to come out on our back deck to watch, they stopped.

over my neighbors house, just above tree level to the north side of the road. it had several lights in different colors, the lights were all i could see in the dark. i slowed down wondering what it was doing, i rolled down my car window and was almost at a complete stop when the object went over my head to the south. i never did hear any sound and as it flew over me it seemed to have a triangle shape. it was dark and i could only make out the shape by the lights it had on it and it moved off fast and i didn't have chance to get out of my car before it was gone. i was shocked and realized it couldn't have been a helicopter or i could have heard it as close to me as it was. when i got to my house, which is about 1/10 of a mile away i asked my husband if he had heard a helicopter or anything and he hadn't. i called my neighbor to ask if they had seen anything and they weren't home at the time, they arrived about 10 minutes after i saw the object over their house.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

on the 22nd april 2015 when a very bright object in the sky caught my eye as it became visible above my 1 story house. it was a rather large triangular shaped flying object with bright red and green lights on the underneath which is the only thing i could see...I couldn't see any height of the flying craft. it flew silently across the perth sky from a south westerly to a north westerly direction where it became out of sight due to it's descend which at the rate it was steadily flying and the direction i would think it would either land or submerge into the indian ocean close to scarborough beach. i witnessed this for at least 1 1/2 minutes and was able to get someone from my house to check it out too. it was very close to earth and an incredible sight i can't stop thinking about it as i know there must have been other witnesses.
