confirm after which they became an almoat nightly appearance.\r\nit was the most amazing thing ive ever witnessed glowing and pulsating and even after becoming familiar with them over period of several weeks would move up and down in response to finger movements and at times seem to respond to questions yelled at them. very bright orbs of light like a star but much different they immeaditly caught my eye.\r\ni did not know what to think so i went and got mother to confirm it was really there she stood and watched it for what seemed like 5 minutes saying yes it is therr what is it? i said an orb!\r\nit seemed to hover and move around on a nightly basis for months multiple different orbs appearing and communicating with motion.\r\ni felt at peace and like they were here to protect me and keep me safe.\r\nthey would stay out till morning came and dissapear or sometimes float away dissapearing from eyes view. i asked them to bless me with patience and one floated away and came back short while later i felt like i could ask them for anything at all i asked them to bring me a gift and one night a trail of blue glowing lights appeared leading to a hill top i felt so at peace realized i needed nothing so walked back home and then a disc craft flew by. i had taken multiple pictures and videos and even put some on facebook but the government deleted them. i also was subject to heavy amounts of oppression amd harrassment during this time and still am. i emailed the la times and sac bee telling them of this and expecting someone to come out to see this as it happened nearly every night but no one did. i will try to get some more pics next time it happens but eventually the harrassment grew so great i stopped trying to talk about it but in a humorous turn of events my mom would see them and go so have you seen the orbs and i would be like theres one right there and she would go i thought that was one. the department of defense and air force raided my friends father during this time with those names appearing on the discovery with this order social security, air force, d.O.D which i can only attribute to a comment i made on facebook about my friends t-shirt saying cant bust this as we were also under federal investigation for a unrelated reason relating to narcotics distribution on my part atleast and rhen these orbs started appearing every night and i wasnt indicted but then i kinda got the idea the government jus wanted me to go back to the narcotics thing and not talk about the orbs but at this point i feel like telling anyone who wants to hear because of the way ive been treated. i also emailed the muslim people through facebook because they reminded me of the morning star in the quran and i had pictures at the time before they mysteriously dissapeared. they witnessed them and the way they responded to me and actually sent someone to offer there help financially or otherwise and then more stuff happened so just be aware the government is really worried about this report and i was brave enough to share it with you. i believe i can have the . orbs appear if given a weeks time or so as i feel it was a spiritual experience. thank you for your time and sorry the pics and video were deleted and stolen from me.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

western sky. then it occurred to me to go to the other side of my backyard to check out the eastern sky.  i have a lot of trees and need to move to get an unobstructed view.\r\n\r\n2. from my new position i looked up into the southern sky. i was amazed to see four glowing fuzzy white cylinder/rod shaped objects in the far distance at 60 degrees from the horizon.  the objects were in a stationary/hovering vertical and evenly spaced pattern. as if they were waiting to be observed.\r\n\r\n3. i had no idea what these 4 cylindrical objects glowing patchy white could be called.  they were definitely not airplanes.\r\n\r\n4. then,as i watched, the top object took off toward the northeast.  the other three objects began to follow the first one extremely fast.  it took maybe 5-8 seconds for all of them to cross the sky from southeast to almost due northeast.  \r\n \r\n5.  my first reaction was excitement and awe that i was viewing a unique occurrence. i tracked the objects across the sky and as i was doing this i thought \"who are you?\" in my mind and projected this out to the objects.  i didn't get any kind of response physically or mentally.  but, i felt it would be worth attempting to communicate. \r\n\r\n6. the first object disappeared into the northeast distance. maybe into clouds.  then all three of the other white glowing cylinders disappeared into the same vicinity as the first one.  as if they all had the same exit trajectory point.  when the objects had disappeared i came into my house and immediately called my son at work to tell him about my experience.  he told me about this website for reporting ufo's.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

previous contact with the owner([name removed/cms/rjl],) of the only known video of the actual downing of this aircraft, and was trying to get her to give me an original copy for examination.\r\n\r\nwhen i asked her for a copy, she seemed a bit suspicious, and asked me if i was interested in the ufo, which she had been informed appeared in her video. apparently she had provided a copy to an investigator who contacted her, not long after the crash, which took place on april 21, 2007. she would not reveal to me who this person who contacted her, was, and she would not give me a copy of the footage. however, she asked me to review it on youtube, which i did.\r\n\r\ni was afraid that she might not give me a copy of the original file, if i said i saw a ufo in the video, so i told her that i thought it could be a bird or a flock of birds. the truth is, i was a little suspicious of what i saw. i later became more suspicious, which it became apparent that the motion didn't see normal, relative to the background and the moving aircraft. it appeared to move in very fast from the right side of the field of view, and then was stationary, disappearing afterwards. i reasoned that only if a bird or flock of birds were flying directly towards or away from the aircraft would i expect this motion. it did not appear to be another aircraft, given that there's no contrail. could it have been a large cargo plane in the distance? perhaps, as many take off and land in this facility.\r\nstill, the motion seemed a bit suspect, as did the illumination. i also became interested in the differences in the mirage effect(doubling of the imagery,) due to the motion of the camera. something could be gleaned from this, regarding the probable distance to this object, also the size of the double, compared to the larger aircraft. i'm not an expert at this but perhaps someone has already studied this in detail to.\r\n\r\ni reasoned that whatever the object is, perhaps it moved in front of the pilot, who went down, and that's why he failed to properly tighten his core, or to pull too hard into the curve. i think the pilot may have seen whatever this object was, and was distracted, or tried to avoid hitting it.\r\n\r\ni took some photos of the crash site, and while i was there something remarkable happened. i was afraid that i might get run off the site, so i left my car running, while i took photographs of the damage and burned areas, left by the downed aircraft. i hurried back to my car, after perhaps 5 minutes, and found the car locked, with the engine still running. the car is a 2004 nissan sentra, and it won't allow you to lock the door from the outside, when you open the door, with the engine running. the mechanism is designed to keep the driver from locking him/herself out of the vehicle, when the engine is still running. there is no way to override this mechanism, and i've experimented with it numerous times since, and had never had this happen in the previous two years of ownership. it's a fool-proof mechanism, or should be. this vehicle does not lock by itself, ever, moving or not. i still own it, and the only way to lock the car while it’s running, is if you have a second keyless entry. \r\n\r\nnote: i did not take the keyless entry off of the chain. it remained in the car. i wasn't worried about leaving it running, because both my wife and i had left the keys in it running countless times, while warming it up in the wintertime. it never locked us out!\r\n\r\nmy brother in law is a master mechanic for nissan, where i purchased the vehicle, and he said that this should not have happened. he agreed that the mechanism is foolproof, you cannot override it, not by lifting up on the handle when you close the door, either ... nothing will over ride this safety feature, except a second keyless entry.\r\n\r\nat first i panicked, because my phone was in the car, and i wasn't near any public phones or places of business. lucky for me, after a few minutes i recalled having stashed a key in a magnetic box, under the vehicle, and i retrieved the spare key, and was able to save myself a lot of trouble.\r\n\r\nwhile this may seem like a small thing, there is much more to this story than i can or want to detail here. i would only that in person, face to face with one of your investigators.\r\n\r\ni'm not a ufo enthusiast. i've never seen a ufo, except in other people's movies. however, i've had personal mystical experiences, which could be considered related to the phenomena.\r\n\r\none thing i will say now is that i was sent to this blue angel crash site by my employer, unofficially. i cannot explain that here.\r\n\r\nhowever, consider this .... in just three years, three of nasa's primary american facilities were directly struck by 3 historic tropical systems. \r\n\r\nhurricane katrina - stennis space center 2005 - historic disaster\r\n\r\ntropical storm fay - cape canaveral 2008, only single tropical system to ever strike the same state four times in four separate locations. in other words, it made landfall in the same state four times. fay also sat on top of nasa's runways, spinning, while dropping over 20 inches of rain, over a period of three days. given this, watching a several day radar animation, you could even say that it appeared to be a target.\r\n\r\nhurricane ike - founder of nasa, namesake storm, made a direct landfall on houston's mission control. that's a little weird, in and of itself. what are the odds that a historic storm of that name would do that? why him, and why there?\r\n\r\nno other u.S. military installations have been directly struck like this, in succession, in all of u.S. history that we know of.\r\n\r\nperhaps someone is sending us a message?\r\n\r\ni'm attaching some footage, relevant snapshots, from ms. richardson film, as well as a scene photo of the crash site, where i experienced the strange vehicle malfunction.\r\n\r\nmy theory? it's hard to say since i experienced no other phenomena related to the vehicle's performance. all i know is, this phenomena with the car door hasn't happened before or since, and i've owned the car for ten years. in fact, i went out yesterday to see if i could duplicate the malfunction, every way i could, and it would not allow me to lock the door with the vehicle running.\r\n\r\nthat's it. please feel free to contact me by email or phone. if you don't get a reply, please call my wife at [phone number moved to fi section/cms/tg], and ask her to call you back.\r\n\r\ni would prefer not to discuss any additional details via phone or email, but only face to face. this is strictly to protect my professional life.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\n[name and phone removed/cms/tg]\r\n\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":64903,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.443681,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04242015-0007","longitude":-80.7644273,"occurred":1178213400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"South

attack choppers in the military his whole career so he knows the difference between a training exercise and a military action. he disclosed that at around 730p or 800p that this large round orange thing went flying over his roof so fast he barely saw it. then 10 seconds later 3 fully loaded and weaponized attack choppers went over his house so low he could probably almost touch them. they shook a picture off his wall. he said he didnt belive in such things like ufos. but that was a ufo being pursued by the us military. i found it ironic that without saying a word to this stranger about what

exactly (or the month or the year,) sometime between 10-6 years ago, and it was a school weekend with no snow. we have a dog, but for some reason she wasn't there that night, nor were my parents, i cannot recall why. \r\n\r\n  i was laying on the bottom-most floor of our house, (small, common tri-level.) i don't remember what i was doing exactly, just that it was dark with no lights or tv on, only the cable box clock for light. i very vividly remember the next part:\r\n  i was looking up at our ceiling, admiring the swirls of plaster in the dark and i glanced to the clock. it read 11:04. i looked back up to the ceiling, then glanced back to the clock. it read 04:11. \r\n  i jumped to my feet, instantly in fight-or-flight mode, goose-bumps across my entire body as listened for any sounds. or any sights. i knew something was wrong. \r\n\r\n  i can not understand why, but at that point i decided that i should go to sleep in my room on the top story. i remember that as i went up, everything was oddly \"peaceful\" and surreal, my footsteps didn't really seem to make any noise, and although there were no lights on, i could clearly see everything. also, it was almost like i had instantly left the adrenaline filled mode i was in, just sorta going-with-it. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  i do not know if the next part happened that same night, but it was some time around then, my parents not home and neither was my dog. in my memory i remember it as the same night, but with the time on the clock, it wouldn't make sense, cause it definitely took place at night, and i had just woken up.  \r\n\r\n  i woke up because of a lack of sound. i slept in a noisy room, many clocks and watches constantly making tick-ticks, and when all the sudden they all stopped, it was odd enough to wake me up. nothing made sound though, analog clocks were all still ticking, just no noise. i wasn't tired at all however. i don't know what time it was, jsut that some how i \"know\" it was night. \r\n  \r\n  i got the same surreal go-with-it feeling as before, however, i didn't feel like sleeping again so i got up, and then i noticed my window. i have quite the fear of windows at night, so all the blinds in the house are always closed at night. every edge of the window though, it seemed to be \"bleeding\" in a white-blue light into the house, there weren't rays though, it was like only the walls around the edges of the window were being affected. even so, just like before even though it was completely dark in the house, i could clearly see everything.\r\n  \r\n  i didn't get scared though, it was more a curiosity than anything, but i wasn't allowed to open the blinds, i thought about it, and i just couldn't. i knew there was something above my house, i don't know if it was directly, but i just knew.\r\n\r\n  i exited my room and went downstairs at this point. our stairs exit out into the kitchen, where we have 3 digital clocks, one on the oven, one on the microwave, and one on the cable-box that you can see in the downstairs (where i was before).\r\n\r\n  i don't know how, but i knew that if i looked at the clocks, i would see something, so i did. at one point i had written down what they said, but i can't remember and have lost the paper, but it was not the time. they all said something that i could clearly identify as a word(s), but i remember not being able to understand it.\r\n\r\n  next i noticed that all the windows facing the south (the direction the window on my room faces) had the same blue light bleeding through the edges. \r\n\r\n  we have double glass doors that lead onto our back porch in our kitchen, i some how had managed to not even think of them this entire time, but i then suddenly remembered them, and looked out them.\r\n  \r\n  the same white-blue glowing light was bleeding around the edges of the doors, however, i remember not being able to see out them, it was definitely black and dark out, however, it was also bright. it was so bright that i had to squint, and then looked away.\r\n  \r\n  the only example i can even think of is when it is cloudy outside, yet you still squint your eyes because some light from the sun outside of the visible spectrum still goes through the clouds and hurts your eyes. \r\n\r\n  i don't know how much longer i was awake, i just know i couldn't look outside, that i walked around the downstairs of our house inspecting things, the light was constant and unwavering, and everything was surreal-ly quiet and calm during the entire thing.\r\n\r\n  i eventually went back upstairs, but on my way up the stairs i stopped. i reached my arm over to the wall, and dug my fingers into it, and ripped out a bit of plaster. \r\n\r\n  i woke up normally the next day, went to the bathroom, and had almost forgotten about the whole thing, like it was a dream. but i looked over on my way down the stairs, there is still a hunk of plaster missing from that wall.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

patio to enjoy the beautiful night.  i was sitting facing the west and i could see the moon at about 90 degrees above horizon with a very bright star to the right. to my left was the roof line to the house and there was another fairly bright star to the left maybe at 100 degrees or so from horizon.  i was looking up at about a 180 degrees while seated.  i noticed a plane going in a southerly direction with the standard blinking aircraft lights. as it was going out of sight due to my roofline that is when my eyes caught something directly above.  it was massive in size compared to the plane i had just seen. it was lights in a triangular/v shape moving south to north. the lights were all same size and shape and we're a pale white/yellow light. they did not blink at all either.  they seemed a little brighter around the edges of the circles. there was one at the point and three lights on one side and 2 on the other. i could not see a ship but the lights were evenly spaced and maintained spacing as it moved. there was no sound at all.  we have lots of commercial planes fly over all the time and i grew up near westover afb with c5a's flying over so i am very familiar with aircraft at night.  i have even seen the stealth bomber flyover during air shows at westover and this was no airplane.  i lost sight after i turned to go to door and get my son.  it flew fast but steady as it went in a northerly direction.  as far as distance i could not tell but looked very high.  this is my testimony to the best of my recollection of the
