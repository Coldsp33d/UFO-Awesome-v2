saw a really really red light moving down the road from east to west. when my family got home i jumped out of the car yelling ufo, because i could still see the red light moving down the road.My brother and sister saw it too. i then noticed the sky was very dark and was blackened out by a massive ship that the red light was attached to. as it moved away down the road, it blackened out the whole sky. we watched it move over the trees until we could not see it anymore.\r\nthere was no wind, it was calm, and no sound was made, i couldn't even hear insects.\r\n\r\nabout a year later, in july of 1969, at night while sleeping,i felt i floated through my window and screen, and ended up on a table somewhere else.  there was a very pure white light on the right side and it was pitch dark on the opposite side. there were three little grays near me, and two or three taller greys standing a little further off. i talked to them telepathically to let me see, let me see, and i saw, like it was invisible, my back yard with a tree and no pump house. i thought that was strange, we had no tree there. it was enjoyable and i felt they gave me a look into the future. 20 years later i went home and my folks had planted a tree and taken out the pump house.\r\nwhen i i woke up it was almost 11am and i had missing time. i jumped up and couldn't find my brother and sister. when they finally came in i asked where they were and they said they didn't know.\r\n\r\nabout three years ago some friends were over and one of them was taking pictures. when she took a picture of me, i saw a gold orb shoot from her hand towards my face. when the picture was developed, 5 or 6 orbs were in the picture.\r\n\r\nmaybe someone else saw the ship in 1968, i just wanted to see if anyone else had seen

outside my boyfriend's work. you can see the stars pretty well out there some nights (like tonight) and there was one that i assume is the north star but am not sure. i asked him if it was the north star, and as he tried to remember i could see that what looked like a very bright star was moving from the top right of the bright star we were observing, toward the left and lowering. there were easily three planes in the area at the time, all which were staying parallel to the ground, all blinking lights, and if not they were all tens of miles (easily) lower than this very bright star-like object. the reason i was amazed is that you could tell that this thing must have been something incredible to give off such a bright light from so far away, and the best part was that the north star was a perfect point of reference to see how fast and far the object was actually going. my boyfriend is a serious skeptic, and he witnessed a ufo with me in michigan last summer, which he now doesn't like to admit. he tells people \"i don't know it was something\", despite watching it zig zag and blast off at insane speeds and distance. this is important to note because he said \"it could be a plane... no that's definitely not a plane, because that's a plane... it could be a satellite... no wait it's moving so weird though, wait is it stopping? it stopped? it's moving again...\" etc. he is completely dumbfounded with what we just saw. although we didn't see the craft in detail, it was certainly moving completely unlike any man-made aircraft. there is a zero percent doubt in my mind that this was extra terrestrial. so here is a detailed description of the sighting:\r\n\r\n1. we look at this bright star, we see that a round, bright star-like craft is directing itself from the top right of the star (i believe it was north east and moving westward), sort of wobbling up and down but still with observable control. \r\n2. it then flew (the movement was very fluid and natural) down passed the star until it was equal distance away from the star as it was when we first saw it, only on the other side and below instead of above the star. it kept moving left. it moved up and down in a shallow zigzag and the light was still white and remaining steadily lit, no fluttering or change in size of the object was visible yet.\r\n3. there were 2 points during its path where it stopped, wavered a little, then continued.\r\n4. it got about 5x-6x the distance away from the star, still going left, but starting to move upward. at this point the light was more dim and the object appeared slightly smaller/further away. then it just disappeared in about 2 seconds, like maybe it dissipated or perhaps shot off too quickly  for my eyes to adjust. then it was gone. this whole thing lasted between 2-3 minutes.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

except one fair weather cloud heading towards me and almost overhead. the cloud was at an altitude where piper cub planes normally fly. the cloud was approx. 1000' long, 300' wide and 300' tall. the bottom half of the cloud was white and the top half was dark. as i'm looking at the cloud a circle formed. as i focused on the circle i noticed there was flat rotation of the clouds that made up the circle. i cannot remember which direction it was rotating. it was rotating at about 5 rpm. the circle was approx. 75'-100' in diameter. after about 5 seconds the rotation started to lower and with it came more clouds forming a short, straight walled funnel that came down about 100' and then stopped lowering. with-in a few seconds the rotation started going back up the inside of the funnel leaving the walls of the funnel intact. the walls were approx. 20' thick. as it got about 20' into the funnel the appearance of the rotating clouds turned into a very bright white smooth and perfectly round, 100\" diameter object with a slight convex bottom. the object moved another 50' upward then in a blink of the eye it shot upwards through the remainder of the cloud. there was about a 400' spray of clouds that shot out of the top of the cloud from the punch hole. when i looked up the hole as it passed overhead i could see the walls were as smooth a drill hole in a piece of wood. i could see the white and dark cloud layer inside the hole. \r\nit was a clear dry evening with calm winds and only that one fair weather cloud. there was no other unusual movement with-in the cloud. \r\npretty cool!

think i witnessed what was a ufo. i was at my nans house just having a drink with my cousin as it was his birthday the day before. at the time of the sighting i had, had about 2 budweiser bottles and about 2-3 small glasses of apple sourz, so a fairly pathetic amount of alcohol to assume i was drunk enough to imagine these images or sightings. \r\n   most times on a pissup night i go outside with my mates while they smoke bud, jus to chill. while they smoke bud ill sit having a drink. but alot of the time im sitting just looking up at the night sky. in this particular moment i had had around 3 bottles and a few glasses of sourz, so i was fairly sober. i sat down looking up for about 5 minutes and i saw all the stars as still as usual in the night sky. then i saw an object which was the same colour as the star it appeared to hit (yellow) then change direction. \r\n     when i first saw the object i only noticed it for about 3-4 seconds at which through those small seconds i thought it was a shooting star. but then when it changed direction (after literally looking like it hit the star) which i know is impossible but after losing the object my cousin who witnessed the next direction of the object and watched it as it dissapeared.\r\n     at first my feelings were amazement that i had just witnessed what i percieved to be a u.F.O. but then my feelings turned to dismay as my only witness didnt see the key event of the event itself which was the sudden change of direction. \r\n     the object was lost sight of as my witness of the event watched it as it went across the night sky and just carried on padt the naked eye to see.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

multiple, reoccurring ufo sightings. we initially thought there were only 2 ufo's but as time went on, on non-cloudy evenings when we have a clear view, we have increased our estimated number to 20 and over.\r\n\r\nthe very first time i noticed these ufo's was march 2/2015 at approx. 6:30-7:00pm. i was walking my dog along the path that runs parallel to lake ontario behind my apartment building in downtown kingston ontario when i suddenly noticed an extremely bright, almost golden-colored object in the sky while i was looking towards the south west. i was roughly 100 yards from my building and started to record a video right away. i immediately speculated it to be a ufo and ran inside to tell my boyfriend. from our living room window we could see the \"main one\" (that is what we call the ufo that appears closest to us, the first one we saw) as it hovers in the sky (we estimate between 500 ft-1 mile upwards) seemingly trying to pass off as an ordinary star in the sky. i could have easily mistook it/them for a star, as most everyone else seems to do, if not for that first sighting where it's unnaturally bright, golden presence stuck out like a sore thumb. since that first sighting, however, it/they do not exude that same amount of intense brightness that made me first take notice, but instead look like very bright stars that are easily unnoticed by everyone and lacking anything out of the ordinary on first glance.\r\n\r\nboth he and i noticed that the object appeared to be spinning extremely fast so we went to the roof to record more videos and take a closer look. once there, we also  noticed a second object that appeared quite a bit further away (maybe 2 miles above us) towards the east. we observed them for hours, spinning and hovering and flashing white lights. later that evening, i watched the \"main one\" from my apartment window as it slowly receded further away towards the south west until it was out of view (this was around 9pm). the second ufo was still visible (and more or less in the same spot - from our point of view) when we went to bed around 3am and it stayed for an unknown amount of time afterwards.\r\n\r\nsince that night, we have noticed these \"stars\" nearly every single night (except when it is cloudy). it is hard to say whether there has always been a large number of them the whole time (approx. between 20-40) and we never noticed them before or if their numbers are increasing over time. there are certain nights when they seem particularly \"active\"; a lot of hectic spinning, lights flashing, shape shifting (usually while they are spinning, they crunch up into a ball or stretch themselves out so they become elongated), plenty of which can be seen with the naked eye when one is paying attention. for the first time the other night, we viewed the ufo's with binoculars and we were able to see what appeared to be a dark, metallic craft, triangular in shape, with three white lights down the bottom/center and one red and one blue light above them. the view was not perfectly clear though, so i'm certain we haven't seen all the details yet. \r\n\r\nthis has all been occurring since march 2/2015 and, provided it isn't too cloudy tonight, i am certain i will be seeing them again in the next coming hours. my boyfriend and i have tried telling/showing people about all of this but, aside for a few friends that have seen them with their own eyes and can back our story up, for the most part, people seem to not want to believe it. i, for one, am eager for answers. the overall feeling i get about this whole situation is (and has been from the start) positive and it brings me a lot of excitement. i have acquired a fair number of videos taken from my cellphone, however, the quality does not fully convey everything visually as it appears to us in real life.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

in the low western sky outside the window where i don't believe i've seen a bright star or planet before in 17 years of living in my home. looked like bright venus but the light was fluttering like a star. i thought it might be slowly moving around. i opened the window expecting to hear a distant helicoptor sound, but could detect no sound. it just didn't seem that far away (10 miles or so perhaps.) i watched it for about 15-20 min. color of light was not toward the orange or blue, just similar to what venus might look like. looking at it with not very strong binoculars didn't give much info, but it looked smaller and was not at all fluttering through the binoculars. my iphone compass showed it at 272 degrees west; then a minute or two later it was clearly at 284 degrees and then i realized that it was indeed drifting out of position. over the next several minutes it slowly desended in an arc and i finally lost sight of it at 10:35 pm at 340 degrees west. i drew a diagram using the roof of the house across the street with its smoke stack, vent pipe and nearby tree to be able to determine just where it was when i cane upon it and exacting where it dissapeared behind the roof.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

was moving in very distinct fluid like movements. it moved down to the left then seemed to shift/tilt back and moved fast to the right. this seemed to happen multiple times. as it moved its shape seemed to be disc like but it was so far away. its lights were a orange- yellow-red color to it. my boyfriend was watching with me. i was yelling \"what the hell is that? do you see what im seeing?\" this blew my mind. i have never seen anything like this before. it then seemed to just take off toward utica very fast and it was gone. we remained outside for a couple of hours looking for it again
