i'm guessing around 200 to 300 feet or more in diameter. \r\n\r\nit so happened that there was a pair of kid's binoculars beside me which i picked up. the optics were made of plastic which provided a clear image but not one the clarity of high quality binoculars but at that distance much better than looking with the naked eye. i'm guessing the power of binoculars was about 5x to 10x. using them brought the image of the orb much closer and easier to view. the orb was pulsating light in all directions from the centre outward, with an undefined outer edge that appeared as if the light was spiking all along the outer edge of orb. there was no dimensional sense concerning the orb, a bit like taking a quick look at the sun with your sun-glasses on. you have no sense that it is a three-dimensional globe. instead it looks more like a flat pancake of light that is emanating light in 360 degrees away from the centre of the orb. \r\n\r\nbut here's the really cool part. i had been watching this orb emanating light in all directions when it appeared to close and suddenly disappear. let me describe what i mean. imagine you have drawn a perfect circle and folded the right half over the top of the left-hand side of the circle. now imagine your line of sight is directly divided by the north-south centre line of the circle when the right-hand side of the circle gradually starts to close in the direction of the lef-hand side of the circle. you can see the right-hand side of the circle diminishing in size until it reaches the mid-point of the fold so that you are now looking at only the semi-circle on the left-hand side. where the right-hand side of the circle had been glowing yellow-pinkish light that was totally opaque (i.E. you couldn't see the blue sky behind it) was suddenly the blue sky as it always appeared without obstruction of any kind. \r\n\r\nthe right-hand side continued to close over the left-hand half circle so that as it closed the light became like a crescent of a moon that was being eclipsed by the earth, with the crescent getting smaller until the right hand side of the circle had completely covered the left-hand semi-circle, at which point the emanating light was completely extinguished leaving the uninterrupted blue sky as it had been before the light had suddenly appeared. \r\n\r\nthe time period for the \"closing of the book\" process took slightly longer than a second to complete. it was a gradual process, not like someone slamming an open book shut. \r\n\r\nthe minute the orb of light was extinguished the cottage return to its original darkness. \r\n\r\nwhat i witnessed that day is something i have never seen before or since. the only thing that even comes close is like looking at the setting sun about a half-hour before sundown. except the light was much brighter but not so bright as to wreck your eyesight. i think if i had been on the far shore i would not have been able to look at the light. it would have been too bright to stare at but not as bright as an arc-welder.

and several pictures as i was driving, for a mile or so, reached a pond/clearing and had a better view... pulled over to take video.  stopped for about 5 minutes taking video, there were two spheres, at the time i thought there was only one, and one was the moon?  though after looking at video i saw there were clearly two spheres of light, moving parallel while driving, then, when stopped at one point i think they both hovered and ascended a bit, then one disappeared because the last few videos only show one.   far away video looks like a bright white light, up close zoom videos show goldish red.  one video shows what seems to be a ring like pattern on object.     i was very very very excited, nervous, scared.  after filming for a bit, i noticed it disappeared and flashed, and that's when i got scared and felt it was almost coming towards me or something, so i panicked and drove off.   in actuality it was probably pretty far from me, though it was a cloudy night, and i saw it clear as day, so it must have not been too far.  i thought i may have seen the same thing a few hours later, chased after it, took video, but it seems to be moving faster, and you can see blinking red and blue

it did a quick tight figure eight maneuver, not sure, maybe i just moved a little and i thought it moved??? then it was stationary again. then i thought i know of no helicopter or airplane that could do that.\r\ni then called for a friend to come out and look too. she did, she thought at one time it moved too??\r\nafter about 20 minutes i called the local police station officer to come over and he did. he said it was a planet, and laughed at me. i told him i say it moved! he said as long as it's not on this property we don't care. he laughed and left. \r\ni was at work so i couldn't stay outside and continue to watch it. i did take lots of photographs of object though.\r\nlater i brought up the photos and checked them and in several of the photos it appears to be a cylinder type

so i distinctly remember thinking i had to look up what metal content would have to be in a meteor or meteorite to cause that. however the object went from a colored blur moving quickly and a speck to something that would be between golfball and basketball sized at arms length. the lights on it were bright that i could only really make out a vague shape at distance - cigar is best suited but without fine detail i could not say. the light shifted between an inner color and outer exterior color ringing the lower section. it would go blue, blue-green, white, green-blue, green and pulsed in that pattern. i could not discern a timing but it was not on a steady timing it was a shifting pattern.\r\n\r\nit started in the north-west portion of the sky, i know this because it was to the upper right of my windshield while i headed west. i pulled over to get out my cell phone to start taking pictures. this is when things got odd, and why i have only ever told one person about this, because of fear of ridicule. so i pulled over, got my cellphone out, and just as i did this i saw 2 black suvs go past at a very very high rate of speed. the last blind spot on the road was miles behind me, so not having seen them before now and with how fast they went off down the road, they were doing over 100mph. there were no plates on the back - just black that matched the paint of the vehicles. i know they were black because my headlights gave me a quick glimpse.\r\n\r\ni go to turn my camera app on, on my phone and - the phone is dead. same time headlights sputter and go out, i try to start the car and no response at all in the vehicle. no radio, nothing. so i look down the road and no tail-lights either. they were visible moments before but now just dark. the area was already very dark with no lights in range i could notice so i do not know if there were any other areas with power out. i watch as the object hovers over the nw portion of the sky - quickly zips to almost directly north - hovers - ne - hovers - then back to the starting nw and hovers. the whole time moving and changing directions like no aircraft i know off - though experimental is always possible.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden my car turns on - no keys in the ignition, just on. lights on, radio on to what sounded like a mix of static and modem dial-up connection, and my cell phone was turning on. i go to start the camera app look up and the object zips off into the night sky at an ascending angle looking like a shooting-star in reverse. i then see two suv's that could have been the same ones heading east and a slower rate of speed down the parkway. the radio goes back to music - and i call my friend to say i am going home because i feel ill. \r\n\r\nsince then i have only told my now ex-fiance, who told me to stop thinking dreams are reality, and i figured if she would react like that others likely would too so i kept my mouth shut... but since i have been watching ufo shows and reading whatever i can, but separating hard science from second hand he-said she-said on the net is difficult. i saw the show advertised on amazon, watched, and figured... well cannot hurt to write what i saw because at the least you might have another matching report of this area or similar ones to actually link hard evidence and first hand accounts.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":64831,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.3551367,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04202015-0012","longitude":-77.9289569,"occurred":1335938400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1429555887000,"summary":"Unusual object over lake ontario - north of lake ontario parkway","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1083,"locationName":"Rochester or Hamlin, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:41818"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Chicago","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  i was working on a project inside my garage, when i witnessed this disc.\r\n the disc appeared stationary, and close to my proximity. the disc was glowing orange with yellow lights. the disc appeared for about five minutes, and disappeared. i felt a certain heat beaming into my body while i was observing it.

balls of light comforting me then i felt this hand touch me then he said old friend  it is good to see you again ,i ask the entiti i know your voice of course you do we go back thousands of years showed me a crop circles that will appear in the future,showed me things that are going to happen on earth that certain events like a planet shift slowly into a different orbit it is happning now as our plannet earth is a physical energy like space ship and move through a differnt orbit in another time the crop circle are preparing us for these events that means our earth would be missing in the solar system, this event happen a very long time ago then we will meet our visitor who left our earth in the past.As these event happning we will be visited by more balls light more triangle time ships as mother earth is physical intelligent bean  we all have to help her go through this change, the crop circles shows us energy other life forms on our earth our earth has other forms of entitis that live deep in our earth ,and  live in the deep fabrics of time on earth that traval many light years into our future earths .That is the reason of lost ancient worlds on earth and the apearence of the cropcircles we are all travellers of time we don't die only our bodies rott into the earth we all move on to a different time here on earth become children again until adult then have children so our kids grow up and take care of planet earth while we are gone it is our future speaking through the cropcircles the aliens are ourselfs we would never be able to travel thousands of light years through space to other planets .The only way is to use the crop circles we are going to be visted very soon.","distance":"21-100 Feet,

thought was a twinkling star. than i noticed more of a blinking with many different colors blue,red,green,orange,white after going inside for approx, 2 minutes i got my binocs and my mother. when i looked through the binocs i could see a disc shaped object just hovering. my mother saw it to just so i had a witness.It was there a couple of hours. i tried to get its attention with a light but no dice. i checked every 15 minutes. after 2 and a half hours it disappeared. it looked like it was under orions belt. i was in az for twelve days this was the second time i saw it. i know the difference between a plane and a ship of sorts. this was a ufo i know what i saw and my mother saw. i have been self investigating myself for 10 years using info i learned on mufon and other various sites. this was the most amazing thing i have ever witnessed. i live in nj and was visiting az. which is a hotspot. it was stationary like it was watching. it eventually disappeared. so in twelve days it was seen 2 times the first time was a half an hor the 2nd time was 2.5 hours.  i was elated to see this,it took 7 years since i became active as a self investigator. but like i said this was a ufo and nothing else i know the difference. thank you.","distance":"Over One

n-nw to s-sw with boeing field ( kbfi ) and seatac intl airport ( ksea ) flight lines in view at all times of the day and night. \r\n\r\nat approx 11:10 pm pst i witnessed a twin propeller alaska airlines flight ( i know the airplane and carrier from experience and flight paths ) depart seatac intl. airport and fly due north before making a westward turn towards my location at the above address.\r\n\r\nwhen the airplane was almost directly overhead ( approx 85-87 degrees ) i witnessed what appeared to be a very bright red circular object/orb appear off the right wing of the plane. \r\n\r\nthis bright red object followed the plane before i ran to the sliding door on our deck and called for my girlfriend to come witness this object and as she came outside, the object disappeared but during the time i witnessed the object it paralleled the airplane off the right wing in perfect alignment with the airplane in a westward direction before disappearing.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend and i were on the deck and as i am showing as well as describing what i saw to her, a very bright streak appeared directly overhead moving west to east in what i approximate to be the very same path the object i initially saw take with the airplane.\r\n\r\nthis streak was very sudden and abrupt and travelling at extreme speed ( i did not see an object with this \"streak\" whatever it was ) but found it to be coincidental considering what i had just witnessed.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend and i stayed on the deck for apprx another 2-3 mins before coming inside perplexed as to what we had just witnessed but i felt it necessary to file a report to mufon so a record of this occurrence is made.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
