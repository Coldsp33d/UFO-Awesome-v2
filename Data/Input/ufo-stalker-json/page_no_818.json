it and then it resurfaces, but i will never waiver from what i saw.  mid '80's (either summer of 1984 or 1985) i attended my sister's friends' barbecue before they packed up to move to texas. they are born again christians and the husband is a minister, so there was no alcohol at this party.  the home was located in yonkers ny right by the hudson river in ny.  i recall leaving the party at the beginning of dusk (still light out) and i was driving my mother home.  my baby daughter was in the car seat in the front.  my mother and i were conversing and i glanced up and saw a round object moving in the distance, and thought i must have been seeing things.  my mother was in the back seat, so i didn't point it out.  i recall driving part of the way, but seemed to have lost a bit of time because by the time i got to my mom's home (only about 20 minutes away), it was pitch black outside.  i dropped my mother off (she lives on a one way street), and drove up and around the curve, to the top of the hill, and then made a right onto the road heading toward the adjacent town (a very upscale and prominent town).  as i turned, within a block, i hit a traffic light.  before i got to the light, i looked up and i saw the object again, only it was very low and appeared to be descending!  i felt like i was driving in low motion, all the while staring at this object.  it resembled the starship enterprise, only it was round/disc in shape with windows, and had no additional features like the enterprise.  the closer i got to the traffic light, the lower this object appeared.  at this point, i'm looking from far left of the windshield . . . to the far right of my ford ltd - 8 cylinder vehicle and could not see the entire craft!  i remember grabbing onto my daughter's hand, and totally started to panic!  in my head, i'm thinking \"how huge is this thing, if their purpose is to try and land!\"  \"how come i am the only person who sees this thing?!\"  i truly thought we were being invaded.  no one is on the road!  this is a highly populated area, 30 minutes from manhattan!!  i heard no noise.  i saw no other living sole.  i don't know how many times the light might have changed.  i kept staring at this object.  everyone is going to think i am crazy!  who is going to believe me!!  i don't recall how much time passed, but this object was hovering and very, very low, and did not make a sound.  i kept thinking if it ever landed, it could have taken out several towns!  i finally noticed the light change and i slowly proceeded (thinking \"if they see my car moving, who knows what is going to happen.\"), as i headed toward the next town.  the object quickly (and silently) rose, and i continued to watch it while i drove toward the town.  by the time i got to the town near the train station, it disappeared into the darkness.  seeing an object off into the distance is one thing; however, this object was so huge, i was not able to see from one end of the object to the other through my car windshield!  that was 30 years ago and i can picture it in my head like it happened last night!  i know what i saw and i won't deviate from my story.  i don't know why no one else saw this object on a sunday evening in august of 1984-1985, but it happened.  yes, i can find out the exact year through my sister's friend.  living in an extremely populated area only makes the experience more puzzling.  yes, it happened.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

 as i turned onto co highway 86 into nashwauk, i noticed a large silver orb, appox 15ft in diameter slowly floating from west to east appox 100ft above the ground.  i stopped my car in the middle of the road and watched for appox 1 minute when the orb slowed and stopped directly above the road appox 100ft in front of me and 100ft above the ground.  at this point i got out of my car and just watched it for appox 7-8 minutes.\r\n\r\nit was completely spherical, silver with no seams.  completely smooth and reflective (but not quite mirror like, more like a chrome bumper that reflected some, but not perfectly).  made no noise.  i thought it might be a balloon but it was too close to the ground, a perfect sphere, solid like steel, and it stopped.  i also noted it was a north wind so it was not following the direction of the wind.  i just stared at it for what seemed like 7-8 minutes, but i'm not sure.  \r\n\r\nalso notable was i was stopped right in the middle of the road with my car door wide open.  no other cars came by during this time which was strange.  it was a sunday morning so traffic was slow but this was a main entrance into town.  there always was traffic in and out on this road.\r\n\r\nafter the 7-8 minutes passed it started moving again to the east, completely silent, slowly at first for a couple hundred feet, than accelerating quickly to well over 100mph, perhaps faster but not over the sound barrier. \r\n\r\ni just stood dumbfounded for a minute, got in my car and continued on to my friends house less than 1/2 mile away in town.  i still don't know exactly what i saw, but i'll consider it a ufo always.  no alien contact, no communication, just a sighting at an incredibly close distance.  i'm not aware of any loss of or acceleration of time but i'm still confused as to how transfixed i was by the object and that no other vehicles came by during that time.  still confused to this day as to what exactly i saw.","distance":"21-100

have seen a lot of air traffic and air traffic is not allowed to fly that low.Has to my left at my 10 a clock position. it slowed to stop for a couple of seconds. looking at it i was highly curious.I was also a commercial photographer at one time and i have very good eye for detail.Has i noticed when it stopped the light came from the inside of the craft not the exterior of the craft. has it moved it seemed to be floating rather effortlessly.No sound at all.The light was a medium illumination. i remember a structure of the light in a circular and tall going around the craft. there was smaller shadows in the light has it stood for that moment.Has it started to move west it was about 3 blocks away at about 250 ft. high.It was clear evening. stars were clear.Has it went, in a floating manner ascended,a couple of seconds more it shimmied left to right  abruptly and it picked up speed and in a curve it went from a west path to a south west path. within a few more seconds moving,still in view, in an attitude of the adjusting in the bend of flight it just vanished, that was it.There is nothing in the sky that moves in this manner, and at the height has low.I have seen helicopters operate within these altitudes, but the sound of a chopper is very distinct,and loud at the height and distance from my position,also the way the object moved makes a chopper look clumsy.The object

pulsate and all went off at the same time. at first i thought about following. i had to stop myself. and then i became afraid...Because of the unknown. i spoke w/ a biology teacher and was poo pooed

get dressed and go out into the back yard, which i did. after waiting about 5 minutes, another object came in from the north travelling south at many thousands of mph.  this time it was at a much higher altitude because it was much smaller (almost star like).  it zig zagged a few times but generally kept on a southerly course.  it stopped above the southern horizon and descended until it was

light descended onto my corn field and took away a good harvest. my brother [name removed/cms/rjl] ran out the house screamin bout the corn. it had taken all year to muture and now we'd have no money for fresh food or clothes. the winter came and went and by golly it was a harsh time for us. my cows were very upset. anyway the light descended and came towards my cows. edwardo, the biggest one of the bunch mooed slowly. the light finally touched down and burnt away the grass surrounding the area. out of the light emerged a slug. a robotic slug. it spewed lots of slime and let out a slug like noise. \"ugh\" it shouted. very slug like. the slug then burned my cows, mutilated my cows, and depressed my cows. depressed as in needs help. after burning, mutilating, and depressed my cows the slug took little  and got into back the orb. the orb took off and hovered over my bald head. it tried to speak again. the only words i could make out were \"gotta...H..Ave...Me...A...Good...La--asaaagaaaaa.\" the orb then vibrated very intensly. like one of them tiny bullet vibrators. then it shot up into the sky and disappeared forever. i had a hard night explaining things to momma. she wasn't too happy but understood. then i took a bath in the well outside and went to bed.","distance":"20 Feet or

enjoying the magnificent milky way, looking n.E. saw bright red light, miles up/away.  staring, i realized there were 10 or 12 smaller ones, circling the largest light. every 5 minutes  or so, one of the smaller ones would suddenly take off like a shot, disappearing over the horizon in seconds.  my father,  a navy bomber photograper, lived next door, i ran to get him, he was sort of drunk, but came out, watched a couple of the smaller  units blast away from the main one, his comment  was. holy cow! \" i've been in  a hundred military  flights,  and nothing from earth can move like that\", his opinion mirrored mine, as to location, saying they \"looks like they're  out over lake superior.\" then he walked away saying \"don't let them take you away\" . i watched the last of the small units fly away , then the large one made several  circles its self before dissapearing  at a speed so fast it was hard to track visually.   the entire  spectacle  lasted almost an hour. i grew up in a time, 50's and 60's,  when most adults  just took it as fact that ufo's were real. i can remember my parents  talking with their  friends, hearing commits like, well, they allready have dead ones from crashes,  pieces of spaceships , erc., it's only a matter of time before they catch a survivor, then we'll  really know what's going on, some people  were excited,  anticipated meeting our neighbors  from space!. then something  changed, early 60's , no more new articles about  ufo's,  the government started denying their  existence, etc.  literally like a huge ufo cover-up became national policy of our government.       during that same time frame, a friend of mine driving her car, said one hovered over her car, about 5 or 6 miles  from where i lived. her car died, no power.No lights, nothing, she was terrified,  then it flew away, her car started and she kept  driving, fast.  the next day, there were  only 4 or 5 houses in this desolate little  neighborhood,  but  all reported power failures,  lights, tv's and  radio outages,  etc, 2 more  claimed  they saw a huge bright light hovering overhead maybe a 100 feet over the trees, then flying away.
