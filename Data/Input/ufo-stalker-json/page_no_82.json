by the corner, not far from street light. i looked up toward the sky in the north and noticed a large halo of light partially obscured by the tree-tops of the redwoods behind my neighbors house. i remember thinking that i've never noticed the moon in that direction before. i then noticed the halo of light was moving slowly out of the tree-tops toward me in a path almost directly overhead. as it cleared the tree-tops i was surprised at what was in the center creating the halo of light. at its center was a brilliant, white, inverted cone of light. it wasn't a light fanning out from a source, spreading and diminishing. the cone of light had a definite starting point and a definite ending point along the bottom rim of the cone, almost like it was thicker, or \"lipped\" around the wide, circular base. the cone of light ended abruptly at its wide base and seemed to have an almost \"solid\" nature to it. it was the brightest, most brilliant white you can imagine. as far as the angle of the cone, it was like an isosceles triangle. the source of the cone of light was not visible, however there did seem to be a very dim, dark red color from which the pointed end of cone emanated. it was completely silent. i am fairly certain it was less than 500 ft up, more likely 200-300 ft. i was mesmerized by it and watched it for almost 10 minutes until it disappeared in the fog bank toward the ocean. unfortunately, i didn't have my cell with me and didn't want to risk missing it by running in to get it...Although in retrospect, i would've had time. this was almost 2 years ago and i

christmas lights in the park. we were headed back to my house (east) and we were looking at lights in a neighborhood. i was seeing a long strand of red lights over everything slanted diagonally in a negative slope. i was thinking \"there isn't a mountain or house here.\" i truly thought they were christmas lights. then i get my mom to pull over at east parker road and canterberry parkway, parker, colorado. i get out and immediately pull up an app i use for astrophotography on my iphone called nightcap pro camera 9.0. i get it on night mode, boost brightness, and start recording while i gather as much evidence i could. the lights moved over us (and i mean incredibly close) at a slightly positive slope and then began heading sw at a negative slope. the lights were red and blinked. when the red blinked a smaller, dimmer silvery flash occurred. they appeared to radiate one after another from the center. i do remember seeing darkish brownish trails. i knew that i needed to get the best shot i could for evidence. it was eventually so freakishly odd we had to just get home. we were able to see the objects continue out into the horizon where they were so close they looked like an irregular star cluster as they disappeared into the horizon. every time a plane or helicopter flies over me, i can hear it. what's so eerie about these lights is that everything occurred without the

driver in the next car lane heard us and began to look out of the window as well. we all attempted to take videos of it but couldn't get anything solid where you could see them clearly. we also have an audio recording of us all describing what we had seen exactly, but we're not sure any of it is good evdidence. the strangest part was that they all seem to be connected. at first they were in a straight diagonal line, then they began to shift into a different shape. we observed them for maybe about 10-15 minutes. we could still see them in the sky, just further away. there were other much bigger lights in the sky as well, but we could clearly tell they were planes, where the other ones we had no idea of what they could possibly be. none of us have ever seen anything like it. i checked the most recent sightings on here as soon as i could and was shocked to see there were similar sightings in our area. it's comforting to know we weren't the only ones who saw it, however we are all

was a week night around 9pm in either spring or fall of 1978. i am sure of that because it was not hot or cold outside. my co- worker and i were wiring a new 84 lumber in ventura or santa barbra, ca. after we were finished work that day, usually about 5 or 6 pm, we decided to drive down to the beach. we were sitting there in a parking space, in the work truck, overlooking the ocean. it was after sundown and the sky was a crisp and clear twilight blue. there may have been a few stars beginning to show or a moon starting to come up. it was just one of those picturesque night time skies.\r\n\r\nthere were buildings behind us to the left and an ocean point in front to the right. all of a sudden a light, kind of like a flare lit up on that point. it looked like a roman candle the way it spits out sparks between fire balls. i remember thinking its not the 4th of july what’s going on. that went on for what seemed like a long time for a roman candle not to spit out a ball of fire. then finally it spit one out, then another and another and another. theses balls seemed to go really far into different parts of the sky and they were different colors, red, blue, green and white/silver. they sat there in the sky for a while until the sparks from where they came stopped. then one at a time they started to move to new positions super-fast and then stop abruptly. they continued to do this sort of dance changing direction every time they would move and they would take turns moving.\r\n\r\nwe were speechless as we watched this dance go on for probably for a minute or two.  then each one, one at a time flew directly into the white/silver one and the white/silver one  flew in a circular pattern very fast and took off straight up and out of sight in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\ni still get goose bumps when i think about what we saw. i have no doubt that there are ufo’s out there but i try to keep it to myself. this was also way before the movie, close encounters, but that is almost exactly what these balls of light looked like only a bit further away.\r\n","distance":"Over One

the front porch and we all looked to the left because the orange glow got our attention comming from the lower field.There wasa tree line between the house and lower field so we couldnt tell what the glow was caused by.We saw a orange orb fly over the tree tops from lower field and headed in our direction and decented 3 feet off ground  we were on a opened porch 4 feet high and when it got to the it raised up about 2 feet off floor and came across the porch real slow.We were standing 3 wide my aunt in middle,she held her arms out and directed us back to the wall saying watch out let this thing come by,as it came by it being so close we could have touched it.As it cleared porch floor it desended about 3 feet from the ground and continued though the yard and down into the woods. traveling not more than a slow walking speed. the next day my cousin and i went to the lower field and all of the grass was flattened in a strange pattern.Since than i have seen about 6 or more of these orbs a one

presumed it was a shooting star so i looked up. then i saw the pulse again. naturally i presumed it was a plane and continued walking. then it occurred to me that the light i had seen had not been moving. i looked again and it had moved from a south east direction  to a south direction and appeared stationary there,over the campus. it had a white light which pulsed off occasionally. every time the white light pulsed on it would be accompanied by a faint red flash. i watched the light for several seconds. if i looked directly at it i only saw the lights but if i looked at it with my peripheral vision i think i could see a dark triangular shape. the white light appeared to be from the centre of this dark triangle. it was completely silent and completely stationary over the campus. i started to jog towards it but suddenly the light was gone and i couldn't see any trace of it anywhere.","distance":"21-100
