States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"January to may 1967, as a very young sailor, i was stationed at a small auxilary bombing range, outside the town of \"stumpy point\", in dare county nc.  at the range, were three towers about 100 feet high where crews would man to watch as af (from seamore-johnson afb) and navy (from nas oceana and several carriers off the coast) bombers, and fighters would come each night to drop practice bombs.  our job was to give coordinates (triangulate), to determine where the bomb landed.  the area was carved out of the swamps, in the shape of a key, with one tower at each of the three oints.  distance between towers was approximtely one mile. each tower was manned by at least six individuals and the main tower, is where the \"night commander\", always a senior petty officer,would supervise all of the sailors.\r\n\r\nfrom the main tower looking northward, was a gravel road about 20 feet wide, which went all the way around the swamp, connecting all of the towers, plus a large storage buiding on the far north end of the swamp. the area inside that road, was swamp and a \"lake\" which was more than ten feet deep.\r\n\r\nsometime in march after the last snow of the year, i was in the main tower as the primary observer (with large bioculars mounted on the steel frame of the tower, meaning i was actual outside the tower itself).  after a break, i came inside to warm up  it was exactly 10:45 pm at the time.  i came in and immediately grabbed a bottle of soda from ice chest we always had available.  after i opened the bottle, something caught my eye.  \r\n\r\non the north portion of the road coming from the direction of the storage building, was what appeared to be a military-like tank (with its treads covering the entire road). it was totally flat on top (no turret). first, there were no such vehicles on our base.  secondly, it glowed a pale bluish-white , and was extremely bright..  i immediately called out to every one to look, pointing at the vehicle.  needless to say everyone looked and we were literally in awe at what we were seeing. when the \"tank\" got to the edge of the road, where it turned to the east , it stopped. and slowly hovered over the water of the swamp, where it changed its shape, into an unusual saucer shape, but totally unusual; it took on a shape that i would describe as a \"potato chip\". by that i mean its \"wings\" turned upward, and its tail and nose downward, very similar to the shape of a potato chip!  it had no openings, windows or other protrutions other than it was very thick in the center, as if to have maybe two or three internal levels.  it had no markings that i could see but it did have one heck of a bright (white) light on the bottom-center of it.  \r\n\r\nthe craft began moving toward the main tower, drifrting over the water at maybe ten feet alitiude, at best, at about maybe five or ten miles per hour (i could only guess).  it was approximately 3/4 of a mile from where we first saw it, to the tower.  when it was about 100 feet or so from the tower, it turned so that the bottom of the vehicle was facing us and rose to the level of the tower, where we were all watching, scaring all of us.  we were all panicy as this beast \"stared at us\".  i estimate it to have been about 50-to-75 feet in diameter, at least the size of the tower office.  it turned on its light that practically blinded us all, for about what seemed like a few minutes. this part continued below. \r\n\r\nthe craft shut off the olight and turned to a level position, and instantly moved to the east tower.  its speed was unbelievable.  it was literally instant!.  it did the same thing to the east tower, and then went to the south tower.  we all watched this going on, and discussed what we saw, totally confused.  suddenly, the craft turned verticle and took off at an outrageous speed, straight up, disappearing from our line of sight, straight up, within less than  ... seconds.  it took off east directly over the pamlico sound toward the atlantic.\r\n\r\nat that point, the phone rang, shocking us back to reality.  it was senior chief petty officer, who was livid because no on answeed th phone.  he said he had been calling since 11:00 pm.  we all looked up the wall clock, which read 12:50 am, a variation of more than two hours since the incident happened.  those of us who had wristwatches compared time... everyone had a different time, varying upward of 20 minutes to over an hour.  this royally spooked all of us!\r\n\r\nat that point in time, the commander of the base drove up in a military truck, and climbed the stairs ot the tower.  he was extemely peeved, and curse all of us out for our lack of responding to his calls.  when we told him of our experience, he made phone call and within a matter of maybe a minute, four af jests passed over the range, heading east, with full afterburners on, headuiing the direction of the saucer.  we also found out that two carriers at sea, launched air craft, after the saucer. in our minds, it had only been maybe a minute that the saucer left us.\r\n\r\nthe commander ordered the towers to be closed down, and he took us all (all threeee towers)back to the main barracks, where we were ordered to report to the galley.  no one was allowed to leave the room, except to the toilet, with an armed guard.  \r\n\r\nsince no police (mp's) were assigned to our base, i have no idea where they came from. there was an entire company of army mp's present, blocking our barracks and several other areas.  sitting across the highway, about 100 feet from the galley was a very large helicopter, and two smaller choppers.\r\n\r\nin all there were about20 of us who witnessed the event. all were present in the galley.  we sat there from about 1 am til the sun rose, not allowed to sleep, or leave the area.  each of us called into a room, which had no windows and interrogated by two men.  one was in a suit and never spoke.  the other was an af lieutenant colonel.  sometime around 8am, we were all ushered to the helicopters, and taken to seamore-johnson afb, where we were interrogated as if we were terrorists.  \r\n\r\nwe were held totally incommunicado, for almost ten days, when i was singled out and sent back to my parent command, at nas oceana.  there, i was taken in handcuffs to my barracks, to pack all my gear, and sent to san diego, in a small business jet, with a guard.  there, i was reassigned to \"garbage duty\" (which is to say, a job no one wanted). a few months later, i was sent to vietnam. \r\n\r\nthis was extemely hard on me, because i was a 20 year old newly weed, forced to leave my wife with her family in virginia.  once in san diego, she flew out to meet me, and would not believe that i was being guarded like common criminal.  i was ordered to speak to no one about the situation, even her.  she didn't believe me, thinking i was having an affair, which almost led to a divorce.  thankfully we worked it out.\r\n\r\nin vietnam (on the battlefield!), i was met at our hq by two men in busioness suits, who took me aside, and warned me in no uncertain terms that if i made mention of the inciednt (which was now almost a year behhind me), i would be immeditely transfered to fort leavenworth. suffice it to say, they scared the hell out of me. \r\n\r\nneedless to say, almost fifty years has past me by.  i'm now close to 70, and in poor health. what's the navy gonna do now?  put me in jail and pay for all of my medical care?  i doubt it seriously.\r\n\r\nnow back to the situation at the tower.\r\n\r\nthe following happened that changed me forever.  it took me years to sort it out and attempt to make sence of .. so much so, that i ended up with some very strange mental problems, which i could not, nor dare share with a professional.  i seen in my mind scenes which did not make any sense. there nights i would go outside in the yard away from my wife, and cry like a baby.  i had nightsweats for years, until it all began to make some sense, roughly 30 years after the fact.  let me attempt to explain.\r\n\r\nwhen the saucer turned it light on, nothing seemed to change for me.  i remembered nothing, and yetd, something happened i cannot explain. in a dream some few weeks later, i remeber seeing a \"room\" with the brighness of stainless steel, which appeared to be an operating room. i was standing near the table, and heard a voice say \"not him!\" twice. then i found myself back at the tower.  \r\n\r\ni sat on the floor shaking my entire body, and then woke from my dream.  in the dream , i never saw any occupents, nor the one who said the statement. it freaked me out for the longest time, not knowing or understanding what was meant.  was it real, or my imagination?  i never understood.\r\n\r\napparently something about me was not accepted by whomever it was, that had brought me to this place.  what if i had been accepted?  would i have undergone proding and poking as other have reported?  was i aboard that vessel, or maybe a mother-ship?  i still don't know, but have wondered for more than 48 years.\r\n\r\nwhile in vietnam, i came in contact with one of my former shipmates who had also been in one of the towers.  he turned out to be an alcoholic, who stayed drunk as often as he could, and admitted that he was trying to forget the incident.. he suffered some terrific nightmares, and was extremely paranoid.   \r\n\r\nwe talked some, before his guard came and got him, and left the area.  he mentioned that all of the men in stumpy point had moved out and sent to locations all over the world.  stumpy point base was apparently closed for aa while, and then reopened when the vietnam wor hit its apex, sometime around 1969.

love birds and thought it was odd...The jet was traveling in a northerly fashion from the east going towards north west-most likely to land at a nearby airport. the time was 5:55 pm friday, april 17, 2015 ( today-a few hours ago)-the whole thing took a few minutes. because i am a bird lover and curious, i continued looking up in the sky. i started thinking about birds interfering with planes in flight. this bird like object descended and started traveling from right to left. i had been in my car and stopped in a parking lot to see this through my windshield.\r\ni had no storage in my phone left for video-so i could only observe.\r\nwhat caught my attention was its speed-i finally realized it wasn't a bird because it was traveling faster than the plane!\r\ni had my prescription sunglasses on so my eyes were not deceiving me! not under the influence of anything as well! \r\nthis was in daylight during rush hour! i was in rush hour traffic here on long island-suburbia where this isn't supposed to happen!\r\ni keep thinking military-there is a nearby marines base. drones? don't know!\r\nanyway-the bird with wings eventually became an orb and met up with another orb

springs area. after turning from moores lane onto concord rd traveling n/nw we both observed a gradient grey (dark grey to light grey) triangular craft hovering very low over the tree line.  at first we thought it might be an airplane but both noticed it wasn't actually going anywhere. the craft had a light/lights at each corner that were bright, didn't pulsate or blink, but appeared to change from white to yellowish to a bluish color. the craft appeared to be stationary for 20-30 seconds over the trees, not traveling at an angle and wasn't moving in any direction. suddenly, the craft shot at about a 45 degree angle up and to the left (one straight line). the second before it moved, the whole craft flipped onto its side and the lights were facing us. it traveled the length of two football fields in the blink of an eye. it hovered at its new location for about 10 seconds and disappeared. \r\n\r\nwhile this was happening we were both watching it but not really talking about what we were seeing. we were both calm, didn't feel alarmed, but i remember thinking that a plane that close to the ground in a residential area was dangerous and wondering if the storm rolling in made it fly lower. it was until it flipped from perpendicular to the ground to sideways perpendicular to us and shot upward so fast that he and i questioned each other as to what we were looking at. we still were calm but somewhat nervously laughing that \"um, exactly what did that thing just do and did you see that?!\" by the time we asked each other it was gone.\r\n\r\nthe most pronounced fact about this is how clearly we could see it. i could likely draw it. it was not an airplane. the gradience of the color was....Odd. and the speed with which it traveled, flipped and then stopped in mid air defied anything we had ever seen and the lights quite bright. \r\n\r\nthere was a large and rather violent storm moving into the area and the craft was not in the storm but far enough between us and the storm line (storm was at least 4 miles away in the nolensville rd/lenox village area) where the clouds provided a perfect backdrop to see it. it was too close to us to have flown into any cloud cover because the cloud line consisted of large cumulonimbus off into the distance and clear skies where the craft was. we had a clear view of the sky and did not see the direction in which it disappeared. we didn't lose sight of it in the trees or at any time...It just vanished. we drove around looking for it but couldn't locate it after it disappeared. it was never higher than a 50-75 story building. afterward we didn't even really talk about it...Just went about our way, which now that i write this, seems very odd.","distance":"101-500

trail out of it passed from west to east over the area  and when it went over my head i sat there and  4 minutes ,it , or another one passed back  west to east at a fierce pace and that was all of it. i am having experiences since 5 years old  and can assure you that  jesus is god and lord  and as the bible says :no weapon formed against god will prosper: look what happened jesus and yet i know that he lives. i have been shot at and it,s a miracle escape i had.These entities are either obedient  or disobedient to the lord and  i wouldnt like to be the one who is dissobedient to him  as , as, the bible says he and his followers are the winners in the end so if i was you i wouold get born again and saved , its the moest important thing to do as i secures your eternity , in jesus precious name  amen. [name removed/cms/tg]   17  04  2015  friday thank you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was outside having a smoke and happened to look up at a magpie in the tree above me, i saw what looked like a star at first but noticed it was moving. so i went out on front patio to get a better look because i thought i saw a smaller light following it. and there were 2 lights, a bright star sized one and a smaller one that looked like a jet but with no blinking lights. i called my wife to come and check it out and she saw it immediately because of how they were both moving at the exact same speed in a strait line. we watched it until they both just instantly disappeared. my wife was saying did you see that, they both just vanished. i said ya, that was awesome. no vapour trial, no sound, and it was a calm and quiet and cool night. there should have been something. i came in right away and started to see if maybe it was a satellite or something that someone else has seen before. there were others on earlier dates that described the exact same thing. so now i am here telling you what we saw. we are not nuts, we both saw the same things at the same time. i work for shell as an instrumentation mechanic and my wife is a nurse and instructor for the u of
