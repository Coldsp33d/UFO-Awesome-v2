over my apartment complex way up in the sky. definitely close to being outside of the atmosphere if it was even in it at all. in the last glimpse i caught of it, it looked like every vision of a

small robot things with spike on there heads came out of it and shot some  beam gun at it and i heard gargles screamed then i saw 4 black suvs pile at the spot from nowhere and scare off these robot spike heads and a black helo came across the horizon and then suddenly crashed for no reason and i was scared so i called the sheriff office and the phones weren't working and some neatly dress men with sunglasses come into my front door and begin harassing me with question like what did i see and what was out there and they grabbed my arm and tried draging me to there really nice 1969 i think model cadillac and i went in the back seat and they put a bag over my head which i could also see through then i hear the tell me that this was a failed training exercise and ask me for some water and my moving truck and about then i was tired so they took the bag off my head and  let me back into my cabin and they left and by that time all those plane reminents were gone and i think i pass out.

looked up and instantly my eyes locked onto an orange sphere, the second i looked at it it shot off across the horizon at an incredible speed.  i didn't really think that much of it so i went to back in the house and back to bed.  the next night i woke up a second time , walked outside and again, i saw the orange light in the same place shoot off across the horizon at the same speed and dissapeared. this time i was like \"wow, that's the same thing i saw the night before\". i noticed it was the same time as well.  i walked back in the house and went back to bed and went t sleep.. the following night, 3am i woke up , went outside and looked up and saw it again. still to this day i have no idea why i woke up.  i sleep good, i never wake up in the middle of the night. so i went back to bed except this time was different. its still really fuzzy, but i have memory of being in a craft, in the water, it was daylight outside. i knew we were in water because there were windows in the craft. in the craft there was a fit women controlling it, and a man who was like me. he was just as amazed as i was. we didn't talk to each other from what i remember, the one thing that sticks in my mind is how i felt while in the craft..I felt what i would only describe as a heavenly feeling..I'd never felt so comfortable. i had no worries, no fear, i felt like i belonged there so to speak. i remember thinking that i never wanted to go back home.  that about it. i woke up at home the next morning and everything felt really strange.  i had a clean  sort of pure energy.  i never felt so healthy both physically and mentally.  the next night was something i'll never forget, i woke up on the sofa and there were beings accumulating in my house, 3 of looked like your typical alien, but a little but different, they had small heads not like a big bulbous head. they were blue and kinda glowy or luminescent.  they didn't speak, they use telepathy and i could tell thy were reading my thoughts. cuz they would answer me with a hand gesture and a thought without me saying anything.  i could go on for a long time telling you about that night. ive had a few experiences since then as

said, \"what is that flying so low\"  so i replied, \"ahh it's probably a chopper\" what happens next gives me the chills just talking about it. my brother said, \" if thats a chopper why did all the lights turn off?\" i barely caught a glimpse as it passed over and a seen a light or two, but when he asked why did all the lights turn off thats when i payed close attention; knowing that i could possibly be viewing something other-worldly. i stared with all my focus because my bro could not look as we were on the freeway. \r\nwhen i observed the craft all i seen was a white light moving slowly to the west of our position at about 100 feet elevation. i kept watching the white light hoping to see it zip off like most ufos will do. but it did not. it went from solid white to a series of strobes: red, green, blue, and some other colors i could not perceive. once it started flashing it did something strange: the ship which must have been a flat diamond or a rectangle stood up as if pointing straight up and began glowing the same colors that were flashing. the ship was glowing because there were some sort of engravings that resemble veins that illuminated the same colors that were flashing which was an extraordinary sight! at this time i was so excited to be seeing this craft and expecting it to zip away i chose not to try and record this ufo, observing such an otherworldly craft was payment enough for me :) as we progressed on the freeway we were losing sight of the ufo from obstructions but as i looked back at what i just observed i can still see the strobing green red blue lights from about a mile away as the ship continued on its way west. this is not my first encounter with a ufo in my city during my first incident about 8 years ago i only seen the craft as it zipped away leaving a trail of solid and strobed lights in its path. im guessing this could be the same craft i witnessed the first time. i believe in aliens and ufos i now understand the feeling of being looked at crazy when talking about ufos. for me i dont expect a gov excuse or explanation for what i saw. what i saw was real.

bright white star-like light in the sky. it was way too bright to be a star so i watched it to see if it was a plane. after watching it for a couple seconds it suddenly moved to the left. that's when i noticed it wasn't a plane because a plane just doesn't slide to the left in the sky. then the bright star-like object moved to the right. after watching it move to the left, dropped down in elevation and re elevated is when i told myself that has to be a ufo. it seemed to be hovering and traveling east but every now and then it would go to the left, the right, down in elevation and back up again. by the time it stayed still in the sky was when it was closest to me. it went from the horizon of the sky to the middle of the sky in a matter of a minute or two with irregular flight patterns. i was really freaked out about what i saw so i went inside right away and told my girl friend. she thought i was seeing things so i told her to take a look for herself. she did not see it move at all but she did say it was a very bright star. in the matter of an hour or so, i went to the window to see if it was still there and it had actually moved sw more towards the horizon where i could see it through the tree line at my house. the weirdest part was that the light was even brighter now and there was another bright white star-like light next to it. the one on the left kept getting brighter and brighter while the 2nd light stayed the same. neither of the two lights were in that area of the sky the first time i went outside and i thought it was really weird that the first one i saw was gone but now there were two in another section of the sky. i told my girl friend that the ufo we were looking at is no longer in the sky and she told that she knows because she saw it more towards the horizon. she is not a believer but she thought it was really weird. i on the other hand do believe and i know that is not normal and had to be 2 ufos of some sort. i actually just got up to see if the 2 bright white star-like ufos are still in the sky and they are. this has been going on for over an hour now and starting to freak me out. the brightest one seems to have stayed in
