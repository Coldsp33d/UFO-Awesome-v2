(that i know of.)\r\n2. is my speculation even realistic?\r\n3. fighter jets. ...Really?!\r\n4. are there similar encounters or observations within the ufo-experienced community?","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":64683,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.243391740911626,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04152015-0008","longitude":-88.47250614553253,"occurred":1000263600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1429124100000,"summary":"Explosions in the sky. definitely not f-16's","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"54915","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4963,"locationName":"Appleton, Wisconsin","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:42937"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Phoenix","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in my backyard looking through my binoculars at the heavens. as i was viewing through the binoculars i noticed a triangular craft coming into view it has three lights i need corner of the craft 2 lights were yellowish and one light was red. the craft was black in color. the craft moved fairly slowly. by the time i noticed it it was moving to the south east on a straight line trajectory. it disappeared over the rooftops and that was the last i saw it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":64682,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.42894870802855,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04152015-0007","longitude":-111.9834754329597,"occurred":1428754680000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1429115546000,"summary":"Black triangular craft","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"85040","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4,"locationName":"Phoenix, Arizona","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:42938"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, 500 Feet or Less","city":"Capac/Brown City/Imlay ci","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Glowing lights horizontally appeared... northwest horizon... viewed at m21 and corner store parking lot... the glowing lights vanished ... mins went by ..2 appeared exactly the same ...A few mins went by ...Then vanished .. a few mins went by ...3 appeared exactly the same lasted a few minutes then vanished.... over 7+ helicopters and drones and a stealth approached the horizon area where objects were hovering ... they separated heading east south ... circled about half way then were gone .... \r\ngot out of vehicle after the lights had disappeared... saw all of our aircraft approaching the area ...One helicopter was silent no noise ..The other was loud ... there was an aircraft that had 3 lights shaped as a v wide wing span ... came from west to east over top of us and kept going east ... \r\ni was shaking ..Thrilled...Scared ...Astonished ...Shocked ... in awe... i'm very happy i was able to experience this in my lifetime ...I'm 43yrs old ..My friend that was with me is 32yrs old ..

i noticed it, the being started to hide it behind him. in my mind i was thinking it was the novacaine shot because the being went to hide it from me, like the dentist hides the shot from the patient, yet i knew it wasn't the novacaine shot. they were just making me think that in my mind. i begin to speak to them and realized that i was drunk-like. my words were slurred. i explaining to them that i was not afraid of the dentist and they didn't need to hide this object from me. next thing i know one of them leaned in towards my face and that's when i went unconscious. i woke up during the middle of a procedure and my mouth was wide open. they were doing something but they saw i was conscious and leaned in again and i went out. this is the end of the encounter.\r\n\r\nthe next day, i remembered my experience, which at first i thought was a dream. i began to look for evidence and saw that my mouth was split in the right corner. this made me start to think it was not a dream. also, my tongue was not numb, but less sensitive to heat, as i had to reheat my coffee an extra 15 to 20 seconds in order to feel it to the usual temperature. i also had a strange taste in my mouth. i wouldn't say it was metallic, but it was strange. additionally over the next few days, i completely lost my sense of smell. that's when i discovered a large lump inside my nose that wasn't there before. it was inside the septum part on my right nostril.\r\n\r\none other thing that disturbs me is, i used to have a beautiful gold crown on a back molar. i have not had any work done on it, but have discovered just recently, that the crown has been replaced by a gold cap. this disturbs me the most.\r\n\r\ni have had numerous strange experiences sort of like this, but had no proof.\r\n\r\nhere is one from childhood:\r\n\r\ni was 6-7 years old in denver colorado which is my home. i did not see anything or remember anything but i will explain briefly what happened. i was at a playground with my older brother, leonard, who was always good at watching me and very responsible. i was facing west while swinging, as he faced east playing marbles on the ground below and behind me. suddenly he jumped up and screamed, \"run, there's a flying saucer.\" before i could even react, he ran away as fast as he could, leaving me by myself. i looked in the sky to the west and saw an advertising airplane with the lights on flying about in the distance and it was certainly no threat. i knew that my brother would know better and that he surely would not have thought that plane was a flying saucer. i turned to go home, it was dusk. the next thing i remember is, it was very dark and i was walking up to the porch of my house and my oldest brother david alarmingly said, \"where were you? we were just getting ready to go look for you.\" i asked where my brother leonard was and david said, \"he's in bed, he's sleeping.\" i then realized that some amount of time had passed, but i didn't, or couldn't say anything. i thought david wouldn't believe me.\r\n\r\ni was 6-7 years old, leonard was almost 2 years older, and david was 8-9 years older than me. the playground was at most, two blocks away from my home. these were short city blocks.\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":64679,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.499811726412716,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04152015-0004","longitude":-97.85029062739412,"occurred":1212303600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1429093728000,"summary":"Abduction

seeing lights because we live close to atlanta and see planes all the time, but this one seemed low and going the wrong direction. all of a sudden,i see it quickly fall  and my first thought was that this plane must be going down. i notice a blue light on the left side and a red light on the right side of the \"headlight\". the main light gets much dimmer as i get closer probably because of my vantage point. i slowed down in case it is going to crash, but then it stopped and seemed to hover over the tree line. at this point i'm about half a mile from it. i had cars behind me so i slowed a bit as i drove under it. it was hovering close to the road near a home. as i glanced straight  up, i saw a shape. the best way to describe it was two helicopters touching noses and the tails separated in the shape of a v. it was not how i have ever seen them described before so it threw me. they were more lights on the edges of the object and all were red and blue. there were no lights on the bottom or protrusions on the bottom. the point of the object was no longer pointing towards the direction i had just come from but about 90* away from the road (it was pointing at 12:00 and now 3:00) as i got about 1/2 mile down the road, i decided to turn around and get another look because i just didn't believe my eyes. as i turned around i didn't see it anymore and thought maybe the trees were

two red lights horizontal to ach other and began to ask my two friends what they thought they was. before i could get it out a huge white light came on in the shape of a rectangle. i was in shock it felt. it stayed on for what seemed to be several minutes and a red light appeared inside the white light. it also seemed as something was moving inside the light. the light eventually went out and it was then just red lights, it moved slowly off to the left of our position going behind a southward mountain. i wanted to see were it went so we three began running south to get another view of it. this is when the adrenaline and heart rate was really going and i'm not sure what i saw but sarah was the first to see it again and point it out. when i caught sight of again it moved directly over top of us and existed of several, maybe nine dimly lit red lights with two on the very end of it blinking back and forth. it seemed very low in altitude and made absolutely no sound whatsoever. to answer what do i think it was? i honestly don't know but it seemed intelligent. my feelings of this experience is mixed in confusion, wonder, was it spiritual? never a day goes by that i don't think about it. id like more than anything to have an answer for it, whatever it was. the actual outside the object could not be determined due to the blackness of the sky. even when it went directly overhead no shape could be seen.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

first, then we all saw it. it was moving very slowly coming toward us from diectly in front of us from the northwest. my children were even aware that this was something strange.\r\nit continued coming from the north west for about a minute, then turned to the north, very slowly. continued in that direction for about 45 seconds, then turned to the northeast for the remainder of the sighting. we watched it the entire time. it simply kept travelling ne to a nne direction until it dissapeared/faded.\r\nthis is not the first time i have seen this type of object. i have been seeing them since i was a child. i have been close enough to touch one on one occasion.\r\ni reported last month to the nuforc site about a sighting - also witnessed by my wife and myself, here is is the report: \r\n\r\noccurred : 3/11/2015 21:30 (entered as : 03/11/2015 21:30)\r\nreported: 3/11/2015 6:16:35 pm 18:16\r\nposted: 3/13/2015\r\nlocation: pictou landing (canada), ns\r\nshape: circle\r\nduration:40 seconds\r\norange/red ball of light, arrived into field of view from southeast faster than a military jet, slowed, zig-zagged, turned to the north\r\n\r\nout having a smoke approx. 9:30 pm. looking northeast at the stars. noticed a very fast moving orange/reddish object come from the southeast - moving in a north-westerly direction.\r\n\r\nthe object slowed to a speed comparable to a commercial jetliner passing overhead, then zig-zagged up an down very slowly for about 10 seconds/5 times.\r\n\r\nthe object then accelerated extremely quickly and turned to a northerly course until out of sight - about 4 seconds from acceleration until disappearance.\r\n\r\ni have witnessed this type of sighting many times in the past few years - one was particularly unnerving as i was close enough that i could have touched the object if i had tried to. always seen with witnesses. reporting now because i'm seeing objects with increasing frequency.\r\n                           end of report\r\n\r\n\r\ni have witnessed these things many times - with 5 different witnesses. i'm seeing them more often in the last 2 years, however, and i am beginning to be very curious about what they are and why i'm seeing them more often. i wrote that i have always seen them with witnessess, but when i was young i saw them alone. i have witnessed them in 5 different locations in nova scotia, hundreds of kilometers away from one another - and once when i was in alberta.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the early evening of august 24/2014 at around 8 p.M., i witnessed a sphere that originally looked so bright that i thought it was a fireball. i filmed this craft/sphere with my ipad2, for a brief period facing my backyard approaching from behind the house and then over the house. the sphere originally was very bright, almost like it was on fire.I managed to film it for one minute at first and when it was about to go out of my sight, i shut off the camera (as the storage was minimal on the camera). the sphere initially appeared over our backyard and seemed to stop for a moment and than continue right above my girlfriend and i. after i stopped filming initially, the crafts bright light seem to go dull and i could now see a black sphere and what appeared to be a search light. at this point i turned the camera back on and captured the change in the sighting of the sphere as it was approaching above the house and about to leave our sight. before it actually left our sight, the sphere reversed as if it knew i was filming it and made a very loud pop or bang and than it actually shot or fired to the right as if it was a jet boost. it is hard to see it on the video doing this at the beginning of the black sphere part 2 video, but if you look close and listen you will hear the craft make a loud bang and than burst or shoot to the right almost like a nitrous oxide burst. also at this point the black sphere/craft looked like it had a search light as it was moving left to right, which was much different than the video i shot just seconds before. the quality on the first video is great but it is a bit hard to see on the part 2 video (at the beginning at least) but if you watch in hd and look closely you can really see it above the house. i than proceeded to chase it around the house and filmed it as it passed over my town, as far as i could film it. this is my third bizarre sighting, i will site the other video related sighting which was filmed in the same place on august 6 2014 at night case number 64143 (ryan miles mufon investigator). these sightings can be viewed in best quality on youtube under the name codsterl, however i attached two fair quality videos to this report.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path then

happened a few years ago, that's all the information i can give honestly without lying. \r\n\r\ni live in swansea on the south coast of wales, my house is on a hill (this can't be regarded as personal information as swansea is very hilly). i remember for no particular reason just moving my desk chair to my window (south facing) just to admire the view of swansea bay. as i'm looking at the water, i notice what looks to be a green firework over the mumbles (an area of swansea, seen in my pictures). these objects, about 6 or 7 from what i can remember were falling in formation, in a manner of which a firework would, going upwards and outwards from a central point until gently falling downwards, until they all stopped dead midair. at this point, one turned red, and moved up and to the right from where it was, and then the other objects formed up in a perfect line behind it, they were perfectly spaced between themselves. once they were all lined up, they all moved slowly as one in the same plane.\r\n\r\n at this point i was fairly freaked out by the situation and moved away from my window, so unfortunately i can't shed any light on what they did next.\r\n \r\nupon consideration i can only imagine that these objects were in fact over the bristol channel. as i said, my first thought was a distant fire work, so their size from where i was sort of between the star and aspirin option on this page. they left no trail, and the obvious direction changes, hovering and formation flying, plus the fact that one of the objects changed colour makes it apparent this was not in fact a firework. \r\n\r\nfor the sake of helping you visualize what i saw, i went in to google maps street view and screen-shotted swansea bay from a similar angle from where i was witnessing this and roughly added the flight paths of these objects. don't take this as their exact flight path, i'm only illustrating the main changes in their movement and shape.\r\n\r\npicture 1:\r\n\r\nshowing the firework type formation and their apparent motion. they're not moving very quickly.\r\n\r\npicture 2:\r\n\r\nthey stop midair, one turns red.\r\n\r\npicture 3: \r\n\r\ni've shown where the red object finished off, but they were all moving simultaneously. \r\n\r\npicture 4:\r\n\r\nthey sat in this formation for a few seconds, and then started moving up wards in the direction indicated. again, not very quickly, contrary to many other ufo accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\neven as i write this i'm getting a strange feeling of anxiety, i've not heard of anyone else describing what i saw. but the event didn't take place for long, and i just so happened to be looking in that direction. one thing to consider about this is that an earthquake, incredibly rare to this part of the world struck a couple of years later. it might be a coincidence, but i'm aware geological activity and ufo sightings go hand in hand a lot.","distance":"Over One

too close to each other to be safe for planes.\r\ni decided to run inside to get out my nikon digital cam. \r\nwhen i returned, the objects were still approximately in the same area. i pointed my
