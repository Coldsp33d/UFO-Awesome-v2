it first hovers and moves side to side rapidly then remains stationary then after a couple of minutes it descends to where we think is a football field of a high school nearby and it descends very slowly and sometimes it moves left to right as like it were narrowing its landing site. i have yet to go and try and see where it lands and i might do that today. the movement from the videos i will send will show it is not a ship or a helicopter it is far too close and too small for that and i dont know what else it could be maybe somebody has a toy helicopter but its strange someone would fly

she appeared oddly dressed; she looked to be in her 70s-early 80s, at first because of her rather messy gray hair, which fell about to the chin line.  she was about 4-5 ft. tall and wore very short, baggy unironed shorts and a baggy unironed blouse.  she had very thin legs and arms, greyish, pinkish skin.  she did not have the characteristics of progeria disease.  her face seemed normal.  my name was called and i turned by attention to business at hand and went to sit in the adjacent waiting room.  i had been seated there about 15 minutes, when this same woman came to the all glass door and tried to pull it open; she could not pull it open with one hand since her other hand was holding a small book and drink.  i started to get up (walk across the room) to help open the door, but someone sitting beside the door opened it for her.  she then sat down at a right degree angle to me (she at the 90 degrees and me sitting at 180 degrees), about 4 feet away from me.  i was curious about her since she seemed so strangely dressed.  i looked directly at her eyes, and her eyes met mine, and it was then that i noticed she had no white eyeballs; her eyes were completely black!  i was startled and i must have looked so, because she got up instantly and walked out of the waiting room.  i followed behind her about 20 seconds later, but saw her no more after looking around a bit.  (she may have been wearing a wig, she may have had a different kind of contact lense in her eyes, but something about her just seemed strange.  i have been wondering whether she was a hybrid. i also wonder whether anyone else has had an experience similar to this.  i reported this incident to my state director of investigations in mufon and he suggested i enter this report. i do so with hesitation because it sounds so bizarre, but i am a mufon field investigator. (some of my answers on this report really don't apply to this incident, so i answered because i could not submit this report unless i answered the questions - somehow.)","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":64657,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.2638449,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04142015-0017","longitude":-76.8520271,"occurred":1408086000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,  A","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1429051589000,"summary":"This involved an unidentified entity","tags":["entity"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"17112","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":242,"locationName":"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"Alien Encounter","$$hashKey":"object:43268"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Victoria","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hello folks\r\n\"this is a photo of a \"gray alien\" running past my older girl.\" there was no other children or anyone else around at the time of this photo being taking. just her and i. she was showing me her new classes.\" this gray look's like it also has something in its hand.\" as you can see. \"this photo was taking in my home, in the afternoon. \"my place was haunted. we don't live there anymore. \"i live in vancouver now. so enjoy my \"gray\" and please have yourselves a great 24 one last thing. this \"gray\" looks like its running right into our little tree.\" now why was that?

being observed. thought, consciousness, life-force and gravity travel instantaneously throughout the universe. you can look up the thomas young experiment. i figure that was a pleiadian probe sent from one of their bases, the dulce mesa in new mexico, the lemurian base telos next to mt. shasta, the ethereal realm above shasta called shamballa/city of enoch or it came from rainbow city in the center of antarctica. as i turned onto the street a typical government owned black lincoln appeared behind me. i didn't like it tailing me, so i slowed down to force it to pass. i for some reason could hear the woman in the backseat say this to the driver \"it's brewer. he doesn't want us behind him, go around.\" the lincoln went around me not to agitate me. why was it there? the pattern of sighting would state the object i saw was actually above my car for several minutes, but i have no memory of it and eyewitnesses called it in. if that woman was with national security then they installed a nanotube implant that allows me to hear their people or their collective hive mind they're connected to. i've been an abductee my whole life and it looks like some group tried to give me some kind of advantage or they simply use me in their agenda. the greada treaty was signed between the us government and the grays allowing them to abduct us citizens and it got completely out of

it was roof level, it was amber in colour no haze just solid structure no windows couldn't see trail nothing sky was clear apart from odd cloud about 30/40 miles away.I new it was ufo soon as saw it, when first noticed it it was hovering i turned my head and looked again it was still there then it started moving very slowly you had to keep looking to notice it moving. i walked into other room to call hubby to take a look, didn't want to scare children it took about 15 secs from me telling him and him looking there was nothing there beautiful blue sky but not a trace, i know what i saw and my heart was racing with fright when first spotted it.When i lived at a different address about 11/2 years later was closing window in lounge  can't remember what time of year it was but nice weather i looked over swansea bay where you can see the steel works and there was a golden brown bird i think eagle thought it was strange because it was night time maybe 9ish and it looked size of normal bird but miles away called hubby and we both went to front door to take a clearer look, we couldn't believe it it was coming in our direction made no noise and you could tell it was a flying machine for better words it had everything like bird beak, eyes plumage the lot when it went above us about 20 feet the eyes must be cameras as the one nearest us which would have been the left eye looked down on us didn't feel scared though. have looked all over internet to see if could find some spy plane or any plane that resembles it but nothing. from my first story i remember reading in a magazine months later that a lady in australia had spotted the same amber object as myself at tree level think it was 12 o'clock australian time.","distance":"21-100

was outside my apartment smoking at approximately 3:00am. i walked to the field behind my block to look at the stars, which i normally (always) do. i looked up and i saw what looked like a giant purple/vibrant pink - almost electric - octopus looking cloud in the sky. it wasn't in our atmosphere or anything (at least i think it wasn't). it looked like this was happening at a great distance because it was happening at a distance where you'd normally see starlight.\r\n \r\nkeep in mind, i do not have the proper scientific background to describe what i saw but i will do my best.  :p\r\n\r\nnow, this giant purple cloud/octopus looking thing was absorbing these little white lights that looked like stars. near the cloud, these lights would come out of nowhere and travel underneath and inside the cloud. this process kept on repeating itself for more than 45 minutes. i was watching in awe when my buddy from downstairs showed up on his bike. \r\n\r\nhe asked, \"what are you staring at?\". i simply pointed up and said nothing. he muttered to himself,\"holy $^ut!! what the heck is that thing?\". we continued to watch the little stars come outta nowhere and get sucked up by this giant cloud. after a good 45 minutes, we had to walk away. it was late and we could not describe - nor comprehend what we just saw. i've seen several lights in the sky, what we would call your generic \"lights-in-the-sky-doing-crazy-things'. i live in manitoba and you can get a fairly good view of the night sky, especially during the summer \"cabin season\". seems like the majority of stories i've heard pertain to lights in the sky, not giant cloud-like octopi swallowing newly generated stars out of no where.\r\n\r\nif other people seen this thing before, it would be a relief. i was fortunate enough to have my buddy show up and see it for himself. the other time i seen lights in the sky, i was by myself. needless to say, with all these crazy happenings, i upgraded my cellphone (with camera and video!). i will catch something. i am positive that me and another friend saw the hypothesized \"ashen light\" from venus. it was brutally cold, almost -35 celsius when we saw that this past winter. but i digress. hopefully i will hear back from someone in the near future. \r\n\r\nchi-meegwetch (thank you) for your time,\r\n\r\n[name removed/cms/tg] from winnipeg,

driving underneath (~50 mph). it was at least 100 feet wide. i still cannot believe what i witnessed with my own eyes. it was not! a balloon, plane or helicopter. i thought about pulling over to take

moves at a right angle.\r\n\r\ntuesday jan 15, 2002 at 8:48 pm 45-48 degrees, dry, crisp and very clear dark night.\r\n\r\ni am an amateur astronomer since 1973 and very familiar with not only the night sky but local air traffic and weather.\r\n\r\nlights or objects sighted in hayward, ca, 15-25 degrees above the horizon looking east and my position is east of the hayward airport and west of the east bay foothills with lawrence livermore and sandia on the other side about 50 miles.\r\n\r\ni had just got out of my car and removed an item from the trunk and as i turned looking up at the very clear starry night, looking east, with no traffic, and gemini just right of my view above trees and power lines. i then noticed a very large bright red stationary light and quickly discounted mars, a satellite, plane but not yet a helicopter. i assumed it was a helicopter at first by its apparent static movement but it slowly moved in circular pattern and then the light flickered and got dimmer/brighter. it appeared 10 times larger then any planet and many, many times brighter then sirius in the winter. as i watched i noted the background stars (2 faint ones) and i moved away from the neighbors porch light and positioned myself with a better view. i moved around to see it pass behind the power lines and to get a different angle of view. i noticed when i stopped moving that it was making a slow circular motion in a small area. i continued watching and heard nothing and it started moving in a linear manner to the south. i then alerted my neighbor. he came out and observed it. i asked that he turn his porch light off and he stated it would take forever to turn back on but he turned it off anyway. we both continued observing it and then i stated, \"stay here while i grab my binoculars.\" i quickly retrieved them and came out and started viewing it in a wide angle and saw that it seemed to have no shape other then seeming very broad. i zoomed in and still no shape, i zoomed out again and focused to see it better and followed it as it moved. i noted no other lights or surface. it seemed to have a sphere shape but more like a very large bright red orb or sphere shape. i handed the binoculars to my neighbor and he looked for 10-20 seconds. i regained the binoculars and spotted it quickly and as i did it dropped a light from the bottom (not as bright, and much smaller and slightly orange/red) which moved very quickly at a right angle to the bright red light. i stated loudly \"what was that?' and continued following it by eye and binoculars, it then dropped 4-5 more small bright reddish/orange lights that dropped quickly at a regular interval and they seemed to drop just over the hills or tree line. we both witnessed this. they seemed to be like flares shooting down with some sort of trail but they moved quickly, much faster than i would expect from a free fall. they were each slightly different in intensity/size and color. at this point the larger red light continued moving away and dimmed giving the impression of moving quickly away and out or dimming and moving away. i was watching with the naked eye at this point and could no longer locate the large red light nor the multiple smaller lights. i heard no sirens after and no other witnesses. my neighbor returned to his apartment and i sat at my computer recollecting any and all details.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
