about a minute until, one after the other sequentially they disappeared.  it lasted for about 5-10 minutes.  no sound as it progressed which made me wonder bc i think we would have heard an aircraft

streaking across the sky.  there were no other visible lights on it.  it made no sound.  i made my husband come outside and look at it because i thought it looked strange.  we watched it move behind a small patch of cloud cover that was blowing through and then it turned around.\r\n\r\n it went back almost the exact way it came.  it then crossed the entire view of horizon available to me in about 3 minutes, so it had to of been extremely fast.  just before it disappeared from my view, i saw a very small streak of light.  i then checked my phone to get the exact time.

living room flickered on/off and then a bright white light illuminated our whole living room as though it was day time. so we went outside to investigate what had caused this. we saw something that we will never forget. my brother went outside first, followed by my mom and as i was slowly walking towards them i remember the look on my brother and moms face as they looked up at the sky (awe and fear). when i went outside and looked up at what they were looking it, i saw a ufo, it was round and had different lights around it (red and green from what i remember). but that moment i saw it i froze and in a matter of seconds it zig zagged and disappeared into the night. when it was gone, we were speechless. did we really just see what we think we saw?  my block is usually always busy with people and kids riding their bikes. the weird thing is that for once, our block was completely quiet. no one around. i don’t know if anyone else saw this. it seemed like we were the only ones who had seen this. i forgot to mention that my little two year old nephew was left inside the house while we quickly went outside to investigate, and when we came back inside the house; my nephew was making weird sounds and gestures. we had no idea what he was trying to let us know. but it seemed as though he might have seen something. i remember sleeping in my parents room that whole week and then with the light on from that point on until i moved in with my boyfriend. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

up but from my angle it woulda look as if it was going up, may, have been just been coming north.The only problem is that it didnt go in a straight line. it kinda moved in a chiralmotion (swirling or helix direction). (chiralmotion is a scrolling term, that to me, best decribes wat i mean).It also seemed to have characteristics, when i would focus my attention to it, it would act as if to hide behide the tree that was also in the direction of the object.It did that for about five minutes. finally, i said the lords prayer and ask for protection as well as understanding. that if they are not of the lord, and are  different(beings), then i want nothing to do with them. as i was watching this object,it had flashed at me while i was looking in its direction i  had two things going on physically. first i kept getting this prickely feeling all over like tingely. hairs on neck stood up and a shiver. but like a natural sensation.I also have an intense and constant buzzing or vibrational feeling going through me for the last week. i feel the ground move all the time but this is intense. a lot stronge. and people that come around me, constantlt start to feel uneasy, or even comment how chaotic and strange the atmosphere has been intensifying rapidally locally. i kept talking torward the object and stating if it had bad intentions to leave me alone. i never lost sight of it, i simply stated what i needed to and finally broke free internally and went back inside. it was still in the sky when i went in.  \r\nin the first citing, the day before i had seen a simialar object in the sky closer to county airport/air force or national guard base.That object lasted ten minutes in the sky and disappeared. i had the same vibrational feeling. intensely.

helicopter following.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a ufo but after seeing a mufon program hanger 1 i realized it was exactly the same as they showed and it is one of ours. it appeared to be about 30 feet across and flew relatively low - appearing the size of a softball in the sky relative to my position. it flew perfectly straight at a low altitude without any noise. \r\n\r\ni should have know it was one of ours because the cloaking was not perfect. the edges of the triangle rippled showing its shape and there were three large round lights slightly glowing - one on each end of the three points.\r\n\r\ni was very surprised it came back about 20 minutes later on the exact same trajectory, but without a helicopter following it.
