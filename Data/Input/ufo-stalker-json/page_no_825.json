thunderstorm in the area.\r\n\r\nit was about two in the morning, and i couldn't sleep.  my bedroom window was open and its situated on the second floor, which looks out to the south.\r\n\r\nlying in my bed i looked out of the window and saw a horizontal line of multi-colored lights, perhaps 7 or 8.  we live within the flight pattern to salt lake international, and the jets normally pass overhead at about 10,000 feet. whatever i saw was low, slow and noiseless, which i found odd.\r\n\r\ni got up, opened the window and watched the object slowly move south, it was then joined by another similar object following it. like i mentioned, both looked like a vertical line of lights.\r\n\r\ni became intrigued when the first object rotated to the east and the vertical line of lights became the shape of a rounded boomerang. the second line of lights soon did the same.\r\n\r\ni excitedly woke up my wife, she saw them as well, but remains unimpressed about the sighting.\r\n\r\ni have a pilot's license and i'm an aviation buff, so if these were aircraft, they were something i've never seen.\r\n\r\nwe live close to a helicopter base, so it wasn't a helo...And the new nsa center.  perhaps they were part of some special project but they definitely were not helos, or conventional aircraft.\r\n\r\nthis is the second ufo sighting i've had in the area.  the other was a couple of years before. i witnessed a massive, dark, triangle shaped object that flew over the area.  the outline of which was barely discernable and it seemed to be mirroring the stars above it as you looked at the bottom of it.  soundless as well.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

we had our backs leaned against the wall of a wooden shed i was sitting almost to the edge of the wall, we were talking when my brother(18yrs old) pointed on the east south east side i leaned forward a bit and looked up while still sitting and saw a bright green glow light it seemed to be directly over the street which is not far from where we were seated about a 150 ft it was about 10 ft higher than the street post lamp it moved slowly as patiently waiting for something. the entire event lasted about 15-20 minutes it traveled in the sky from the east toward the north in a curved manner then hovered for 4-5 minutes then  moved toward the west. all along the way it did not travel a stable consistent path it moved in a very slow speed quickly zig zagging pattern as if vibrating just a little, the object looked like the size of a basketball with a light on it. the light was bright green extremely bright when it stayed still i was watching and i could barely make out the shape of the solid object. it was circular  and flat on top but the bottom was more like a cone shape not a sphere.It then moved from north toward the west in the night sky, the light source appeared to me to be the size of a golf ball but glowing very very bright what i noticed is that despite its brightness it did not give off surrounding light like a bulb or flashlight. as it passed over the tree top and the leaves of the tree looked dark like if no light shone although it was about 5 ft above the highest branch. since i first saw it i heard no noise coming from it, the ufo was very silent it traveled on the night sky slowly until it had gotten so far i could not see it, the night sky seemed like a normal dark sky, no wind also the neighborhood was asleep no cars no people outside around that we could see, this event took place between 11:30pm - 1:00 am on the month of march 2014. this ufo came from south of the street and curved around us going north stayed still across my wire fence above my neighbors abandoned empty yard then moved toward the west across over the next side of the street on the edge of the small town where i live it went west over the bushes and trees of huge undeveloped land. can someone tell me what are they doing here in central america such a small country belize. here we have no power plants, no war, no mineral mines, no mass production metal factories only farming what makes me scarred is that this ufo came so close to us and slowly it moved until i could no longer see it, also hovered infront on my neighbors land about the height of a 2 floor building what does it want or why come to an uninteresting  place like belize in orange walk disctrict. what is it looking for in the people here? someone answer me..","distance":"21-100 Feet,

and i feel strange saying anything about this. \r\n\r\n  i was taking my pugs out at 9:30 pm on april 09, 2015, pst, and it was a clear night and i always look at stars and try to identify them and i use that google app that helps you identify stars and planets. there was an exceedingly bright star, much brighter than venus and it was going a bit faster than i see satellites go on a normal basis. i also see planes from time to time when i look up and they don't look like stars. planes don't look like bright stars. it was going about 1/2 a degree a second. i watched it from 9:30 pm until 9:32 pm. i yelled at my wife to check it out but she doesn't care about this stuff. it completely disappeared at 9:33 pm, just went out.\r\n\r\n    at first. i thought the object was the space station and i felt super lucky to see it. then, i remembered that i watched it go by last year and it was really faint to see. this object was super bright, like a super bright venus, going way faster than a normal satellite and super bright.  the object did not dim nor differ in any of the two minutes i watched it, it was bright the entire time, it was overly bright. at the third minute it just went dark. no satellite goes dark when still in view. after the light of the object went out, i spotted a dim satellite at 65 degrees to my left and it was traveling at least 5 times slower and much more dim. \r\n\r\n    my location of viewing is: [coordinates moved to fi section/cms/tg]. standing on my porch facing north and putting my arm up in the air, the total viewing time was 80 degrees to my left, and disappeared at about 110 degrees on my right and that was about 2 minutes. it was definitely not a meteor because there was no tail. it simply looked like venus (a ball of light, brighter than venus moving in the sky) if it was about 3 times it's size in the sky. \r\n\r\n    i am a lawyer and an engineer, and for an object to move that fast in a geosynchronous orbit makes no sense to me, especially when the object is so bright, then suddenly goes black.  i know i sound like a crazy person, but that is what i saw. it was literally going super fast in an orbital pattern that is not mathematically possible. what does that? oh, one more thing, it did not change the appearance in any way, it was just a super bright venus for two minutes and the next it just turned off and wasn't there. \r\n \r\ni hope it was an asteroid or some old russian satellite. \r\n\r\n

instead of ufo. coincidently, there was a very fast meteor went westward at the near same moment seeing a jet liner cruising by and noticed a satellite sl-14 r/b watching it dimming and glowing toward northwest. i was about to go to go inside but saw the blip. the meteor did have the same color and magnitude as the blip. the blip was close as polaris in color but maybe one more magnitude dimmer. mag 3-4ish. but, when that meteor entered our atmosphere it was nearly at the same location where the blip occurred. and, that blip occurred about an minute or two afterward that meteor event. there was no floodlight present that can make a dust to sparkle. i know what i saw. i need a way to reach astronomer by large to make sure this was not a false call.\r\n
