Bend","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting in my car in front of my house one night around 1-2am on a weekday. i was on the phone with my girlfriend at the time. i lived at my parents at the time and i smoke and i cant smoke in the house so i sat in my car on the phone and smoked before i went inside. im sitting there for a while, i had my seat laid back pretty far to be comfortable, and so i can see out of the passenger side windows. as im talking i kinda noticed something out of the corner of my eye, i looked really quick and saw nothing and kept talking, i thought nothing of it. a few more minutes pass and i saw something again. i looked, saw nothing, then i thought i might of caught a glimpse of a meteorite, as i have seen those before. \r\n\r\ni tell my g/f that i thought i saw a meteorite. we keep talking, and just a few more moments later i saw something again and this time it was there. it was a point of light moving around erratically. i got out of the car and stood on the sidewalk looking at it. it looked like it was closer than what it was. i thought it was a bat flying around near a street light/power line that was in my backyard, i was in the front. i kept watching to see if i could hear it making any noise because sometimes bats will make a noise, i looked to see if i could see wings flapping, i could see nothing. it was just a point of like bluish white light, and bats don't emit light, and i could not see the reflection of the street light on the bat. then the light moved west and up higher in the sky kinda over my house, and thats when i realized it wasn't a bat.\r\n\r\nit looked like a fly zipping around, moving very fast and going all across the sky. and it looked like it was almost in orbit it was so high up. it would shoot straight up and i could tell then how high up it was. i've been skydiving and have flown so i kind of have a general idea of how high things are and i know the atmosphere ends at about 90-100k ft. it had to close to this. i could not see a shape or how big it was. then all of a sudden a second light appeared out of know where, i feel like it might of came out of the west. but now these 2 lights are interacting with each other, flying around like house flies chasing each other flying across the sky at high rates of speed, changing directions without stopping. i was in awe, i think i got off the phone at some point. there was no noise at all, no planes, and i live near an airport and i see several planes everyday and at night. there were no cars coming down the street or passing on the adjacent street, it was just quiet and eery. i was the only one outside.\r\n\r\nthen a third light appeared. same color as the others, bluish-white. they all flew around doing the same things, it was very humbling because i thought i knew that what i was seeing was something that humans cannot and have not made that was being controlled intelligently by something, i have always been a believer. and it seemed like sometimes i could see a trail of sparkles/glitter when they would shoot in a straight line across the sky at a high rate of speed, then the sparkle/glitter would fade out. one compelling moment i remember distinctly. \r\n\r\nall three points of light gathered into a formation, a horizontal line pretty close to each other, paused, and shot up simultaneously faster than anything i had ever seen before. it was like 0-7k/mph in an instant. the middle light continued upward and the left light veered off to the left and the right light veered off to the right. i was frozen at this point. then they all came back together, zipping around again. i remembered we had a video camera in the house, i went to get it from my parents room and i think the battery was dead. i called a couple friends to tell them and nobody answered, i tried to wake my parents up but they werent interested. when i came back outside there were only 2 lights, and they were kinda doing their own thing, not really chasing one another just flying really fast in each direction across the sky, from west to east and vice versa. then another flight flew off and disappeared. and about 3mins later the last light flew off to the east towards the city and i lost it in the light pollution. i live right on the outskirts of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nthis whole event lasted about 20mins. no cars ever came down the street or passed by. i watched the news the next day to see if anyone else seen what i saw and reported it but nothing was reported.\r\n\r\na year or so later i saw a big bright light hovering maybe a couple thousand feet in the air, relatively low. it was a white light, it made no noise, it hovered, it was stationary. i was with someone else who saw it, we were on the way to the store, about 9-10pm on the north side of town near the airport. when we came out of the store the light was gone. nothing was

the sky walking along until we noticed a star blinking wierd we then noticed another. so at this point we started looking for things we knew were there like sattelites and planes. after spotting a couple of both we started watching these 'stars' which by this point had grown brighter than all other objects minus the moon. they then started moing erractically throughout the sky in all directions until they suddenly vanished. about a week later in riverton just about the same thing happened. i was standing on the corner next to my friends setting up a grill. i noticed a star next to the moon which shouldn't be there. it did the same exact thing, zipping about the sky all super crazy for about 25 minutes and then bam it was gone off and away. i would not shut up for weeks and as a result i found i was not the only one to have seen these 'stars' on both nights. also i only asked people i know so it was not a large pool. i did get three credible people who said they observed them on the north side of mille lacs lake in palisade and in a township called burrows outside of brainerd. a lot of people also see b2 bombers around our area and mistake them however they always fly with a triangle pattern 'forward or backward i have seen both'of white lights on the bottom and follow roads and air

approximately 800-1000ft elevation\r\nno other cars or air traffic visible anywhere\r\ni was with one other person (a woman i was on a date with)\r\n\r\nwe had parked the car on a rough dirt pullover beside a 2-lane country road that went from the nearby small town of fairfax, ca., up over a large hill and then down to a reservoir then on up to a mountain (approximately 2,800 ft. tall) named mt tamalpias. we were standing outside of the car star gazing and talking. i began telling my friend about a ufo i had witnessed about 5 years prior. as i described the bright red light i saw in the distance hovering on the horizon and then instantly switching directions for about 3 hrs. all those years ago, i noticed a small red light hovering over the treetops of the adjacent ridge line of mt. tamalpias and slowly moving towards the north. as soon as i pointed the light out to her while explaining that what i was describing to her looked exactly like the light (same color and size) that was now visible to us both at that very moment, it began to stop and hover and then continue to move northbound. \r\n i kept my eyes fixated on this red light that appeared about the same size as a star in the sky except that it was only about 1-2 miles away from us and hovering just above the treetops. we watched the red light moving north then instantly reverse direction, and then move north instantly again. sometimes it would just instantly stop and hover staying motionless for about 5-15 seconds, before moving either north or south again. then it began to do loops in the sky, quickly rising up and down in a circular pattern of movement. then it would stop and hover before continuing on with this series of erratic maneuvers. after about 15 minutes of watching this red light switching direction back and forth, moving up vertically then dropping down vertically, and then making circulars motions in the sky it finally came to a standstill just above the ridgeline. it hovered there for about 30 seconds than instantly turned into a huge (equal to the size of the sun in the sky but at close range) golden ball of light and than instantly began moving directly towards us in a west by southwest direction. \r\n   as it came closer the giant ball of golden light morphed into 3 distinct smaller but equal sized balls of golden light, each of which was about 1/3 the size of the original ball of light. the closer it got the more visible the shape of a large black triangle became visible with the 3 golden lights clearly marking the 3 corners of a black elongated triangular craft. it took about 15-20 seconds from when it ballooned into a large golden ball of light to fly over us and disappear right over the curvature of a hill just behind us. what was strange about this craft was how it appeared to morph from one light into 3 lights and then as it got close enough to see the size and shape of the craft the 3 golden lights just disappeared leaving just this massive black elongated triangular craft cruise silently right over our heads at treetop height. as it approached and began passing over head, i began running after it but out was moving too fast to keep up pace with it (approximately 30-40 mph). \r\n   the craft itself was approximately 300ft long by 100ft wide, solid black with no visible detail what so ever. it glided gently right by and over us without making any noise at all, not even the slightest wind noise.\r\n   within seconds of it disappearing over the hilltop right behind us, and literally about 50 ft. above the ground at that point, another golden ball of light appeared out of seemingly nowhere from the north and flying in a direction that clearly aligned with the flight path of the black triangle. this second craft had colored lights that were visible on either side of its center golden ball of light. as it approached it was clearly and visibly an airplane of some sort that seemed to be following right after the triangle or perhaps even chasing it.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

my sons girlfriends parents house. after supper while playing cards between hands i went outside for a cigarette.\r\n  while looking around i noticed to the north an object changing shapes. iwas fascinated as i watched this thing move and change my wife eventually came to get me cuz i was holding the game. i told her you got to come see this. i got out my iphone as it was changing shape again snapped a a couple of pictures. i went to the house and told everyone else that they had to come and see this.\r\n    six of us observed for probably ten minutes as it moved to the north as it was just an orb by this time. we went back inside had some discussion on the subject.\r\n    my sons girlfriends parents have religious convictions as i told them of other lights or objects i have seen i think i rattled them.\r\n   we ended the night and returned to my sons house. the next night april 1 while playing cards at my sons i again went outside for a cigarette and there it was again. i observed this again and took a couple of pictures and again had six witnesses.\r\n  now i am freaked but can not verify. apparently  around 2 am police and fire responded to a burning female woman by the river and i heard that two firemen were injured and hospitalized from some kind of chemical ingestion. i am trying to find out more on this. i live in alberta maybe mufon could find out more about the death. i don't know if this is a related event but iwill get my son to save any clippings he can find on the subject while i further investigate this. i have photos and its not no saucer going to edmonton space center monday april 13 with them. you can cll me for information as i thought about going to the rcmp but not sure that is a good idea i could use some help on this thank you.
