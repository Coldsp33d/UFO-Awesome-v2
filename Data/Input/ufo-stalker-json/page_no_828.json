always remained in 4 equally spaced square pattern. i looked around and tried to see if we saw any neighbors to ask what they thought but nobody was around. it was very still and very quiet and i felt sadness and very alone in that moment . my daughters and i age 9 and 11 were watching in awe trying to figure out what it was. at first i thought maybe the huge spot lights various car dealerships and clubs might use but there were no beams and it didn't appear at a angle it was directly above us. we did not see the lights as we pulled in and parked only when we got out almost as if it appeared specifically for us . it was large approximately the size of my building and it was kind of close seemed like. it switched angles maybe 20 degrees south but spinning circular square shaped still. it only lasted about 10 minutes not sure what place would run spot lights for only 10 minutes at 7 pm. couldn't rule it out other than it was ufo . i tried to take video n pictures. the video was blank and the pictures i took were extremely blurry but you can kind of tell there were 4 lights moving . my youngest daughter started to get scared so we went inside. i went back out on my porch n it had moved over to my right a bit for about 2 more minutes then it was gone. haven't seen anything anywhere close to it since.

relatives.  my 20th month old son was with me.  on the night of march 14 i turned onto galloway road from byberry street where i saw a pulsating, blinking object from the west which appeared stationary from where we were.  since we live in an area with three airports (phili, west trenton and another small prop job airport whose name i am blanking on) i initially assumed it was an aircraft.  however, several things dispelled this view.  1) it started to descend whereas a plane from any of the three airports would be ascending in this direction (west to east) 2) it seemed, even from a distance, to be a huge aircraft larger than any of the smaller jets and planes flying in and out of west trenton and the small prop job airport. 3) no other planes were sighted in this particular area at the time   \r\n\r\ni continued to observe the object as i stopped at the red light at galloway.  it definitely remained stationary for about half a minute before moving in a downward descent east.  as the light turned green i continued to look at it as i drove and the object descended so low that i could make out three things (in the course of about 10 seconds)\r\n\r\n1) a light shining underneath it\r\n\r\n2) fan like indentations\r\n\r\n3) a window like hole in the middle of the object\r\n\r\nthe object was definitely triangular in shape.  i kept looking for wings, such as an airplane would have, that i never found.  at this point there was a mixture of fear and awe over the possibility that this was a ufo.\r\n\r\nthe object continued to descend east until i lost sight of it among the buildings on hulmeville road (which intersects galloway).\r\n\r\ni must admit before i end my report that i am avidly interested in ufos and ufology and have been since i was a teenager.  i even watched mufon's special on the history channel.  i am always looking up the stars to see if there is any unusual activity and for the past 25 or so years i have never witnessed any.  this is the only time when i have seen an object that i could not identify as aircraft of some kind.  had my son not been in the car with me (whose safety is my first priority) i would have attempted to follow the craft further.  after several weeks i am still in awe about the incident.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was friday, april 4th, 1969, just a few days before easter. my pal, charlie, and i - two very bored soldiers - were setting out on a hitchhiking expedition from fort bragg, north carolina to myrtle beach, south carolina with vague hopes of scoring with some partying college coeds taking their spring break in the popular seaside town. leaving the base with our backpacks and sleeping bags at about sunset we headed south out of fayetteville on interstate 95.\r\n\r\nreaching the large rest stop, south of the border, a few hours later, we stopped at a coffee shop to grab a cup and get our bearings before continuing on.  sob, as the soldiers called it, was located just across the border in south carolina outside the town of dillon.  while drinking our coffees and looking over our map we couldn't help but notice a rather loud group of local rowdies, talking [item moved/cms/nd] and throwing dirty looks our way. this was the way it was during the rambunctious 1960s. in the area of the south we were in it could be dangerous for hitchhiking strangers, especially blacks, hippies, yankees and soldiers. accordingly, charlie and i took the leering snarls very seriously, finishing up quickly and moving on down the road. \r\n\r\nsoon, we were walking through downtown dillon toward route 25, the old latta highway cutoff toward myrtle beach, still 70 miles away. one good ride would get us there and at the same time get us away from the trouble we both sensed. and sure enough, it wasn't all that long before two cars showed up with our friends from the coffee shop on board, hootin' and hollerin' as they went by. as empty as the town was at this time of night (nearly 10 pm) it didn't bother us too much because of the street lights and the occasional traffic on the road. but, as we reached the edge of town near the cutoff - with the rowdies going by every few minutes and the chances of a ride looking increasingly doubtful - the two of us began looking for an escape hatch. after the loudmouths passed by us again and drove out of sight we took the opportunity to slip off the road into a dimly lit area behind a vacant, broken-down gas station. walking by the left side of the deserted building we followed a wheel-rutted dirt path up and over a small crest, by now barely able to see more than a few feet in front of us as we passed by trees on the edge of the gas station lot into almost complete darkness. \r\n\r\nbut, as the two of us picked our way carefully down the car path, the whole area suddenly lit up in an aqua-green glow showing a small field no more than a few acres in size. now i could see clearly, and what i saw amazed me; there was a three- or four-story high, multi-decked ufo standing on what seemed to be metal legs. in addition, there were beings similar to humans - a head with two eyes, two arms and upright on two legs - but colored green, either an effect of the ambient light or the result of my extreme confusion and fear. they were walking in the field and on decks which curved around the ship, with the nearest one about 20 feet away. he/she/it turned our way, and said firmly (i believe telepathically) \"leave! now!\"\r\n\r\nin spite of the danger that had caused us leave the highway in the first place, both charlie and myself, like the trained soldiers we were, executed a smart about-face and marched right back toward trouble. we hiked at a pretty quick route step down the road a few miles without saying a word to, or looking at, each other, hoofing just as fast as we could out of dillon into some farming and pasturage area.\r\n\r\npresently, the rowdies showed up once more in their cars, making it clear we were their targets for this night. once again, as the cars went out of sight we left the highway, into a cow pasture this time. from a spot a few hundred yards off the road we watched them as they returned looking for us. eventually, the night settled down the cars were gone and we climbed into our sleeping bags.\r\n\r\nthe next morning we continued on to myrtle beach.\r\n\r\nhere's the best part. as far as i can recall we had forgotten about the ufo.\r\n\r\none day, thirty years later my buddy called up from out of the blue and asked me, \"do you remember dillon?\" i had no idea what he was talking about. but as soon as he said, \"the ufo,\" the whole experience came back in a flash.\r\n","distance":"101-500

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Observer: one male adult pedestrian\r\nlocation of observation: drove road (near magic roundabout intersection), swindon, wiltshire, sn1, uk \r\nvisibility: very good. \r\nambient light: just after dusk. streetlights in the area. \r\n\r\ndescription: a triangular craft was seen floating above the quiet residential area immediately to the east of drove road swindon for a short period of time before moving away, in a manner inconsistent with a sighting of any conventional craft. \r\n\r\nthe craft was seen to be floating perfectly still and in complete silence very close to drove road at a low altitude above houses. it is difficult to estimate the altitude of the craft but it was perhaps 50-70ft from the ground, and certainly what would legally constitute ‘low flying’. the craft was very close to the observer and so it could be seen with great clarity. it was very conspicuous and easy to observe. it was clearly not any form of conventional aircraft or any other known object. \r\nthe planform of the craft was a perfect triangle in shape and was larger in area than any one of the houses over which it loitered although it did not appear as large in area as two such houses. at each of the vertices of the visible underside were very large, powerful circular lights (one at each vertex). the character of the light was very similar to that of the surrounding street lights. i.E. a bright flame yellow hue. there was a subtle difference of colour between the light and that of the street lights. namely, it was of a slightly more brilliant character: less burnt and slightly more saturated. \r\n\r\nthe craft itself was of a dark or black colour and with no noticeable surface features. it was not possible to make out the texture of the surface. there were no signs of landing gear or wheels or indeed any other protrusions. the triangle was perhaps a bit broader in the axis of motion. at the centre of the underside, seemingly fixed directly to the bottom of the craft, was a pulsing red light far smaller than the others. this appeared to be very similar in character and frequency if not identical to a standard red anti-collision beacon of the sort used commonly in aviation. the craft loitered perfectly still without any movement or instability and in complete silence over a quiet residential area for an observed period of approximately 3-4 minutes although it was already in-situ when first sighted and so may have been there for a while. it could not have been present for more than 15-20 min as the area was traversed in the opposite direction using the same route approximately this length of time prior to the start of the observation window. it was obvious during the observation that the area immediately underneath the craft must have been very brightly illuminated by the powerful lights. anyone beneath the craft would have been dazzled/blinded. the planform seemed to be entirely parallel to the ground while it was stationary. \r\n\r\nafter about 3-4 minutes, it moved off without any noticeable acceleration. it moved very slowly – perhaps no more than 15mph based on comparisons with moving traffic on drove road. interestingly, it moved with one of the vertices leading, as though that were the nose of the craft. no fins or signs of a tail could be seen. it remained horizontal as it moved away and no instabilities/roll/etc. were visible. almost immediately after beginning to move, the large lights were all switched off. the lights continued to glow and hence remained visible for the duration of the 30-40 seconds it took for the craft to attain diminished visibility to the observer. the afterglow was very distinctive and allowed the craft to remain visible for much longer than would otherwise have been the case. perhaps a qualified lighting expert might be able to identify the type of light involved: the glow was a burnt dim orange-yellow hue and faded very slowly. this also gave the impression that the lights were more powerful than had originally been thought. slight concentric grooves were apparent within the lights as with powerful search lights and floodlights perhaps.  \r\nthe craft was moving in a straight line of constant altitude towards the portion of queen’s drive near to the magic roundabout. however, before reaching that position the craft banked to the right at a very steep angle (nearly vertical) giving an excellent view of the craft from below, something that would not be seen in conventional aviation. \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

my guess. i often stopped at my girlfriends house when i got off work at seven pm and then i would drive home, so i figure i got home around 8:45 ish. \r\n\r\ni lived with my cousin and his wife. the house faced a four laned street and it had a horseshoe drive way. meaning that the driveway went all the way around the house and there were two ways of getting in and out of the yard. i pulled into the driveway and drove around to the back of the house and backed my car into the grass. this meant that i was parked facing the back of the house and i could see across the street. i noticed an object but i didn't pay much mind to it, figuring that i'd identify it when i got out of the car. i grabbed my lunch box and exited the vehicle. i looked at this object and waited for my brain to interpret and process what my eyes were seeing but my brain never did. i took a few steps away from my car and i stopped. by now i am probably about thirty feet from the object. i looked and i remember i kept whispering, \"what is that?\" to myself over and over. i was both afraid, and intrigued. i was completely focused on the object at this point. \r\n\r\nit hovered about six inches from the ground and was about three feet tall. it was egg-shaped (like a blob) and appeared to be organic in nature.............I didn't get that it was a vessel of any kind. it's \"skin\" (for lack of a better term) seemed to move.........Or travel around it's body. it had hundreds of pores........And the pores gave off light reminiscent of lightening bugs.........But lightening bugs are greenish in color.........The color of the lights on this was closer to copper. the lights/pores moved around the entirety of the object in a fluidic.........Organic.....And as far as i could tell, random fashion. the motion of the lights/pores was not aggressive........It was graceful.........But it was completely dynamic: every light/pore seemed to be apt to travel to any and every part of it's body in time. it just hovered there...........It maintained it's basic egg/oval shape but it kept changing a little from top to bottom with the same randomness as the lights.    \r\n\r\ni stood there stunned.......Still whispering, \"what is that?\" i was afraid but again, i was also intrigued and so i began to walk toward the street closer to it and as if noticing me it began to float up. it floated up at the approximate speed of a balloon filled with helium. it went up about fifteen feet and then went to the right and then ascending farther up and back over the house across the street and ended up about thirty feet high or so. it was within the silhouette of a tree........As if it were trying to get to cover. there were no leaves on the tree and of course, it had all of these little lights shining through it's pores so it could still be seen. \r\n\r\ni was completely amazed. my cousins both worked the graveyard shift and they didn't wake up until around 9:30 pm or so, but i woke them up early. i apologized for waking them up but i told them that they had to come outside to see this thing. i pointed at it and asked them what they thought it was. they didn't know. i then went on to tell them what had happened. they weren't quite as amazed as i was but that thing clearly was not of this earth..........And if it was, then it wasn't anything even remotely close to any being i had ever heard of. \r\n\r\nit was cold out so i didn't stay out there long, but i could look out of my bedroom window and i could still see it in the same spot. i went to the window two or three times and it was still there. i went a final time a little after midnight before i went to sleep and it was still there. when i woke up the next morning, it was gone. this was 1988 and so there were no camera phones or any way to photograph it. to this day i regret that i didn't bundle up and stay out there with it. i regret that i didn't call the police and put it on record. i was tired, cold and sleepy and i didn't want anyone to think i was crazy.........So i went to bed. it was the most fascinating thing i'd ever seen and have ever seen since............And i went to bed. \r\n\r\nto this day, i have never heard an encounter even slightly similar to my own but i never really dug that deep into it. i would be beyond appreciative if you know of any stories similar to

it looked like a setting sun and shimmed and glowed.  thinking it was a reflection of some type, i moved head back and forth and lowered and raised my head/shoulders trying to determine if it was in fact a reflection or ?!?!?.  however it did not move and was stationary on the far side of the bridge.\r\n\r\ni still did not know what it was.  i was young and didn't know that ufo's came in a form different than a classic flying saucer... i was confused and didn't know what i was looking at.  i didn't watch for more than 4-5 seconds when it began to rise above the bridge and moved from the back side of the bridge to the front where i could see that it was an entire round orb, and could better make out that it was like a fireball, shimmering and glowing you could see what looked like heat waves coming off on it.  it was not on the ground but was taller than the bridge in total... maybe 8-10 feet off the ground and 15-20 feet above the top of the bridge.  still could not believe what i was seeing so i moved my whole body in large motions as far to the passenger seat as i could... up and down.  i was confused and it didn't make sense.  its hard to remember what happened next as i was still wondering what it could possibly be when it just seemed to disintegrate... it just seemed to disappear in a short period.  not \"on and off\" abruptly but a quick fad/disintegration.\r\n\r\ni was not exactly scared but felt very uneasy and didn't want to keep driving in that direction but had to get to work so kept driving.  i didn't see anything strange when i got to the bridge but i didn't really look much either and sped by as quickly as my little car could take me.  i don't remember other cars coming in the opposite direction or much of anything else until my next turnoff maybe.  it really bothered me and felt shaken  trying to think what it could possibly be.  it was the forth of july and did see small fireworks in the sky afterwords maybe a few miles past the bridge... before my turnoff at hancock.  what i saw could not be a firework. \r\n\r\ni was pretty far away from the bridge when i observed it yet the object was still very noticeable and large.  the bridge appeared very small to give you an idea of how far i was away yet i could very easily see the object.  also, despite being dusk, the object was not really bright... not translucent, solid but not bright... more shimming and why i guessed that it was a reflection at first.\r\n\r\ndidn't tell anyone at work that night or even at home the next morning.  i still had a hard time explaining what i saw and was very unsure of myself.  it wasn't until very many years later when i learned that a ufo/et craft could be some thing other than a metallic disk.\r\n\r\nits been many years and not meaningful in anyway but wanted to finally tell this story.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":64470,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.0354817,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04052015-0023","longitude":-89.5224004,"occurred":584078400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1428301655000,"summary":"Fireball like orb that appeared behind a bridge abutment, raised up and over was stationary then moved a bit to the east and disintegrated ","tags":["fireball"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":9771,"locationName":"Coloma, Wisconsin","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:44434"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Murrieta","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was the morning of april 4 2015 at about 0600; or right before the sun rose above the mountains in the distance.\r\n\r\npsychedelic use was involved so let that be known. that said i have had a lot of experience with psychedelic medicines and i had taken a very low dose and was not in a state where i would see objects that weren't there.\r\n\r\nthis was the shortly after the lunar eclipse had maximized. i was waiting for sky spirits to come and was actively asking them to visit us (my brother an i).\r\n\r\nfirst i see a light that's blinking. about the size of a light of a plane that you would see. this light is the only light that appeared for hours in the sky. at first its far away then i comes straight towards us and eventually goes overhead and past us towards the direction of where the sun rises. \r\n\r\nas it was overhead we were also watching the lunar eclipse which was in the opposite direction of sunrise. before it past us i witnessed a shooting star as well. so it passes us and goes far into the distance toward mountains in the direction where the sun rises.\r\n\r\nlater we see another light coming from a different direction. it starts off going towards lake elsinore; going along the \"mountain chain\" that we were atop. then as i'm talking about sky spirits and joking with my brother that it might be one, it begins to turn abruptly and then goes off in a completely different direction (towards the mountains in the direction in which the sun rises)\r\n\r\nwe continue to watch this blinking light. then i start to noticed a weird electronic interference in the music we're listening to on my phone. as this is occurring i see another light start to blink in and out in the direction where the previously mention light was going. note: at this point the light is miles away.\r\n\r\nthen out of nowhere i hear the loud wind sound of something passing by overhead. when i look up i see a bright orb of light moving before me. still at least around a mile away and note we are on top of a mountain so it's hundreds of feet above us and we're already hundreds of feet above temecula valley. \r\n\r\nso as i'm watching this light i feel a spiritual and emotional connection to the light. i mention to my brother if it was a sky spirit why should it have to prove itself to us? if it was one i could only imagine that it would find it ridiculous and disrespectful for a human to demand it to prove itself that it is itself. \r\n\r\nanyways as i'm saying this, and we're watching the light, and i'm feeling connected to the being, my phone changes the song randomly to a remix i had created with a talk by chief golden light eagle / standing elk about the key to happiness. \r\n\r\ni was in awe. i felt connected to the spirit, and i believe it changed the song to remind us and help us how to live a better life. as the song is playing the light is moving in arcs before us (albeit at least 1-5 miles away) watching us. nearly as soon as the song ends the light begins to fade away and head off into the sunrise.\r\n\r\ni should note a couple of things. this object had a strange trail; almost like a comet. also i should note that the other two blinking lights we witnessed had since disappeared as we had stopped watching them as the other light was much closer and demanded our attention. \r\n\r\nanother thing of note is that my brother witnessed all of this as well, but the last objection we saw he witnessed as a dark sphere with a strange trail/tail. so we both witnessed some kind of strange flying objection; however i witnessed a sphere of white/yellow light and he witnessed a dark orb. \r\n\r\nanother thing i would like to note is that we have witnessed strange things like this a handful of times atop said mountain during other astronomical events such as meteor showers, full moons, etc.\r\n\r\nlastly i should note that while we were under the influence of 2g psilocybin mushrooms; i don't feel that that discounts what we saw. anyone who has experience with psychedelics will tell you that 2g of mushrooms does not occur hallucinations; it causes visual distortions. i should note that i am quite experienced with said medicines and i was in a very mild state of the medicine. \r\n\r\nmy theory on psychedelics and ufo/spirit contact is that it opens you up to them. on top of that psychedelics seem to raise your energy/aura so to me it makes sense that it would cause us to be almost like flares that signal the sky spirits; especially considering we were on top of a mountain during the full moon during a total lunar eclipse.\r\n\r\nthat's all for now. all i know is that if you want to have an experience like this climb to the peak of one of the mountains in the temecula valley area (especially those that border the santa rosa plateau) during an astronomical event (full moon, new moon, meteor showers, etc) and if you're not against psychedelic use take a little bit of mushrooms or something and wait all night and you may witness something.
