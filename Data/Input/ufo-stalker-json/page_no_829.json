getting brighter, lighter from little white dot to some kind of lantern, it was bigger about 10-times, then gets darker like before and move back the same path. when this object show again i run for my brother to watch it with me. it was doing same path and hover with light again. before it flashes, they spawn blue and red light just behind this biggest white one. from this i was able to estimate the size of it... it was really big, because plane are much smaller and have their light closer to each other. next day i question friend of mine, which live near that place... when i was talking about it, he complete my sentence because he saw what we saw and more. he was talking about enormous size of that and teleporting for 100-200m after flashes, it did it 4 times, when 4th was on bigger distance, about 2-5km in opposite direction which it was travelling. he compare it to street light but it was 4 times bigger and higher that this, no sound was hearing there only barking dogs, many

very late feeling quite safe most times.  i was walking in the street when i approached my house so i cross to the sidewalk and at this point i have full view of my backyard which is always pitch black. i live on the edge of a small forest. neighbors aren't very close and i have nothing in my backyard except trees. occasionally deer will wander there but they are dark brown and can clearly see them at night and what they look like. as i was saying, when i crossed to the sidewalk i was around 30-40 feet from my front door. usually i cross the lawn, walk up the steps, go in. i reach the side walk and i see something white in the backyard. it was probably 100 ft away. i stopped on the sidewalk to look more intently.  it didn't appear to be touching the ground and it was bright enough for me to notice. we have no animals in the neighborhood that are white. ive never witnessed this before and i knew it wasn't an animal. what i saw in my backyard was round and bright and didn't appear to be touching the ground. this of course petrified me and i started walking faster to my lawn, as i moved the object seemed to move as well. i only stared at it for a total of 4-5 seconds before i wanted to get inside. it did appear to move slightly towards my direction but only when i started walking again did it move more swiftly.  i'd say it moved at 6 ft per second.  i got inside my house and quickly turned all the lights on. i have to say i wasn't brave enough to look outside again. i felt i may have been confronted by it. i also want to add i know that i do not have any evidence towards my story and that it is just my word and first hand encounter but i have not seen the white object since. p.S. i was on no substance that would hinder my perceptions and i was not tired because i had slept that day till 6pm. i feel very confident that this was some sort of \"alien\" because i've had multiple inexplicable things that have happened to me. none included an encounter with something like this but i've been uneasy since these things have started. hopefully i am not alone in my area and it will be looked into in some way. it's comforting to know i am not alone

southern california just thirty minutes north of los angeles.  we were heading home from a family get together at 3:00am.  i had never been up so late and i was still full of energy from being over stimulated.  i admit that maybe i was asleep during this event but i know without a doubt i was awake during this experience.  my step-father was asleep in the passenger side.  i sat behind my mom in the back seat looking at the night sky.  there were no clouds and the stars were crisp in their brilliance.  i watched the hillside rise and fall in elevation as we drove down the highway.  something came into view that distracted my stargazing. it was boomerang shaped where the center looked like a red box with a yellow flashing light.  it's body was a series of cross beams that held the craft together in a boomerang shape.  this craft moved parallel with the station wagon and i stared at it unblinking.  i tapped the seat in front of me.\r\n\r\n“momma,” i said.  “there's a ufo.”\r\n\r\n“mmmmm,” is all she said ignoring my comment.\r\n\r\ni looked behind us seeing a few cars heading in the same direction.  i wondered if they were seeing what i was seeing.  maybe i was seeing a reflection from the headlights of the vehicles behind us so i rolled down the window.  the craft was still there flying parallel with the station wagon but now i could hear the sound it was making.  there was a low hum like a strong breeze blowing over the mouth of a bottle that whistled.  i rolled the window back up.  i tapped the seat in front of me.\r\n\r\n“momma,” i repeated.  “there's a ufo.”\r\n\r\nagain, “mmmmm,” is all she said.\r\n\r\ni pinched myself to make sure i wasn't dreaming.  the reality of what i was looking at started to sink in.\r\n\r\ni tapped the seat in from of me.\r\n\r\n“momma?” i spoke with a quivering voice.  “there's a ufo,” i struggled to speak through failing lungs.\r\n\r\nagain, “mmmmm” is all she said.\r\n\r\nthis was the last time i tried to get her attention.  she wasn't paying attention to her son whose fear was increasing.  we turned north on main street leaving highway 126 and by this time the craft had disappeared behind the hills.  i couldn't take my eyes away from watching the sky.  i had moved from sitting in my seat to being on my knees as i looked out the rear window as highway 126 fell into the distance.  what came into view didn't frighten me as much as the craft.  five silver comets followed the station wagon in beautiful synchronicity like ballet dancers moving gracefully.  their tails were like streaming ribbons of silver flecked stars.  we turned right on market street.  when we got home i ran into the house.  i was quiet when my mom helped me to bed.  the house we lived in was a small one bedroom shack.  i slept on the sofa in the small living room tucked in as i lay in the dark trying to rationalize what i just experienced.  the front door was visible from where i was positioned.  the door had a window that looked out onto a backdrop of darkness because there had been no street lights.  that's when i saw a face press up against the window.  the face was pale grey and the large black eyes peered in at me.  my mouth gaped as i screamed and i have no further memory of that night.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,

watch it and then drove down the frontage road south of freeway trying to get another look at it.  it was moving east and gaining a lot of altitude quickly.  i turned right on a road going up a hill

ca\r\n\r\ntaking the dog for a walk and noticed a very bright deep red light approaching my position at torrance blvd and maple street in torrance, ca.  the light was moving in an east to west direction at about 100 knots.  the light was steady red.  as a private pilot it caught my attention because there were no other position or blinking strobe lights.  the traffic pattern for departing aircraft from lax briefly follows a similar path but then, the departing traffic typically makes a turn to the north and position lights are easily seen.  i estimate that i initially noticed the red light when it was over the torrance/redondo beach coastline and was at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet.  the light was following a path above torrance blvd or slightly north of torrance blvd.  when the light was about 75 degrees above my position, the red light (over several seconds) dimmed to a very faint red light.  i noticed a small plane crossing the red light’s path and an altitude about 1,000 lower.  it is just before the small plane crossed below the light that it dimmed.  i had with me a very bright 500 lumens flashlight that i pointed at the red light after it dimmed and followed it until it disappeared behind some trees.  the flashlight also has a strobe function that i also used (to see if i could get it’s attention) when following the light.  after returning to the house with the dog (about 10 minutes later) i went back outside to see if i could see any more red lights.  i was shining the light almost straight up over the house when i saw a very faint triangular shaped craft at maybe 4,000 feet and traveling in a south-east to north-west direction at 200 plus knots.  the sides of the triangle were greater than 90 degrees, maybe 100 to 110 degree spread.  there was one light at the front of the triangle and two more evenly spaced on each side.  all the lights were very dim and faded from view shortly after passing overhead.  there was another small plane passing below this craft and the size of the craft seemed to be larger (2x) than a jumbo jet.\r\n\r\ni have many ufo sightings ever since i was a child but never encountered the triangular craft before now.  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

there were 3 glowing lights in the back as it passed.  one on each end in back and one in the middle but lower on the craft  than the other two giving it depth. they didn't throw off any light they

would be willing to take a polygraph, undergo hypnosis, or sodium pentathol . i would swear on the bible or a loved one 's soul as to the authenticity of these events. i am a mature individual and have never had an avenue such as this one to report these experiences. at the time  there were no cell phones to take pictures or videos so i  have only my word and reputation on the line. these things are real and  i follow your show as well as  ancient aliens, i n search of aliens all on the history channel. i am happy to share all of this with you for as much as  i am respected by my

around a bright red light was far away maybe miles away and then instantly went through my tree illuminating the branches red without disturbing a single leaf.. we were hurling over each other and trying to get into the house first. only when we mustered up the courage to go back outside we seen it just backing back through the tree and again illuminating the branches bright red while not disturbing a single branch. when i realize my neighbor across the street from me had seen the same thing we were talking about it with so much feared amusement not sure what to make of it. knowing my son and his friend also seen the same thing it made me feel more credible to know that an adult had witnessed the same thing.  then in the middle of our conversation by neighbor pauses and points behind me over the top of my roof were we both see this red boomerang like object just appeared over the left side of my house and then slowly proceeded north to south (left to right). just as it passed over my house completely it then ascended very very quickly going up like at an angle going south southwest then just disappeared. my wife doesn't even go outside and look at the stars anymore because when she was a witness to it she couldn't believe it. it was too much for her. it is taking a lot of time out of my time spending with my family. my wife does not allow me to talk about it around her. she says it scares her so much not knowing what it is she would rather not see it at all she does not even enjoy going outside and looking up at the stars anymore. my kids see it often outside with me at night time as well. nighttime is when it's most active. i'm not talking about 1 or 2 lights i'm talking about a whole string of different groups of lights that make up many different shaped objects. they drop down almost right on top of me over my head and then they quickly ascend up so high where they look so small again and do it almost instantly. i am willing to prove this to anyone i have already showed my pastor of my church he lend me his video camera and he still doesn't know what to think of it and i actually caught a full saucer on film this time when i was recording. i only did this for my pastor to prove it to him that i wasn't crazy. this has been such a natural occurrence around me that my family and friends now all think that either they believe me cuz i they have seen it when they would listen to me so i could show them or they haven't seen it so i think i'm crazy i'm willing to prove this to anyone. it's almost like an unspoken understanding that when i look at these things they come down literally right in front of me and then when everyone hears that. they think i'm nuts but you have to see it to believe it i'm not playing this is 100% genuine i can guarantee this and my wife and kids see it as well. recently i've been getting these  single little lights coming down that reflect like an -a- and were so bright and brilliant with beautiful colors it almost looks like a fairy even though it sounds silly that's exactly what it looks like some of the time now. please you guys have to believe me i am very willing to prove this to anyone. you can stay in my house and i'll leave or if you want me to be here i can prove it to you and show you in person. i don't want to think that i'm crazy but this phenomenon has been going on for 6 months and i know for a fact its not me or i'm going crazy at all. sorry for sending this in so late a lady from mufon told me to do this a while back i just now got access to a computer. thank you for taking this and thank you for assuring me that i'm not going crazy is a hundred percent real.I hope you you guys seriously consider meeting up with me or at least coming by so you can see it for yourself. thank you","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Insignia,
