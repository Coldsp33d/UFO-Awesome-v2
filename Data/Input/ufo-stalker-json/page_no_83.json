area","country":"US","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The 1973 ufo flap of richland and crawford county\r\n\r\n\r\n   i’ve been lucky enough to see many odd things in my time, but through it all i must admit i’m not much of a believer in aliens from a distant planet coming to earth. it seems to me that an advanced race would figure out pollution is bad and clean up their planet. so why would they come so far just to see our dirt ball of a world that we are in the process of messing up?\r\n   with that in mind i have seen some ufo’s with the first time being shared by many others throughout richland and crawford counties during a time when many ufo’s were being seen. \r\n    if i remember right it was during a warm part of 1973, at least we weren’t wearing jackets then. my ex-sister-in-law and her husband had come over to the house to see if anyone, especially me, would care to go back to galion with them to see all the ufo’s that were flying around. my mom and i took them up on their offer and we went right back with them to their house. \r\n    darkness had already fallen and the sightings had been going on since sunset. so with the twenty minute drive to crestline to pick us up and the trip back, at least forty minutes had passed by the time we got back to their house and we hurried to their back yard as fast as we could to witness the event.\r\n    pat and ed were living in a small house in galion on south riblet street and their back yard was facing toward the center of town. their house was located in amongst others of the same kind with a space of about fifteen feet between them and had a fence running along each side of the backyard. their backyard space had clearly defined boundaries, which turned their backyard into a long rectangle. a doghouse was located almost in the middle of the yard and as i remember the yard was dimly lit by a nearby streetlight. \r\n    other people besides us were already standing around looking at the spectacle in the sky. so i looked up at where they were staring but i didn’t immediately see anything. then after a second or two i began to pick out objects from the black background of the starry sky.\r\n    in all i saw six objects at first flying in different areas of the sky. to me it didn’t seem as though they were flying in any type of formation, just flying in the same area. and all of them seemed to be flying in straight lines although once they had gotten to a certain undefined place they would turn and come back. where we were standing in the backyard, we were facing west and slightly north which was putting them right over galion. \r\n    all of the objects appeared to be identical in color and size and seemed almost to be hanging in the sky barely moving. it was hard to see how large they were at first, then we heard an engine approaching from the north. by this time we had been watching the objects for so long it is certainly possible a plane could have taken off from the galion airport to come and see the spectacle. \r\n    soon i could see the lights in the distance…it was then that i realized the ufos were not going as slow as i thought they were. they were going at least as fast as the plane was that was approaching now that we had something to compare with. \r\n    the objects in the sky were visible, yet hard to see. they were a deep red in color and very passive in their illumination. they didn’t shine with a brilliance, they were just there. i commented at the time their rounded corners and rectangular shape made them look like a piece of good-and-plenty candy. then we saw that the plane, which we only see by it’s lights, because of the dark and one of the pieces of good-and-plenty were heading towards each other.\r\n    at first we thought it was a trick of distance. most of us thought they might do a fly-by and still be hundreds of feet apart, but we were wrong.\r\n    they continued toward each other until everyone on the ground thought they would collide. but right at the last second the red object performed a ninety degree angle downward. looking at it from the ground and off to the side we could tell it wasn’t the type of turn a plane would make. it was so quick in it’s maneuver it was as though there was a sharp corner to its turn and seemed inertia-less. it continued along under the lights of the plane until it was behind the lights of the plane, then performed the same maneuver in reverse going back up to the altitude where it had been at before. about a second later we could hear the engine of the plane rev up as though they were going too do some kind of evasive maneuver, but the craft had already gone by.\r\n    i knew pat had a little twelve power telescope in a closet and asked if i could borrow it to try and get a closer look. “sure, go ahead!” she said also thinking it would be great to see them closer. i ran inside and quickly returned with the small device. it’s quality was not really up to the task, the legs were only a couple of feet long so i tried setting it up on the doghouse to get it up a little higher. when i had brought it out everyone’s eyes were still riveted on the section of the sky where the plane had been. that was to the east and south; i was facing to the north toward the covert manufacturing company. there were some trees in another back yard, a road, and the back parking lot of the company in that direction. the plane had flown away, but the objects were still in the sky over galion however, i wanted to get the telescope going so i could see better. as a result my back was to the group when a flash of light blinded me. \r\n    i remember fumbling around with the telescope then i found a firm grip on the roof of the doghouse and just stood there in shock. then i heard the others exclaiming, “what was that!?!” and “it lit the yard up like it was daylight!” another person who had been looking farther away said, ”it lit up the whole town!” \r\n    it had only been a few seconds but already my vision was beginning to clear. from a complete whiteout it had changed to a dotted line of white streaks. to try and remember i think there were about ten of the streaks in my line of sight and to describe it better it looked like a brilliantly colored dotted line. \r\n    i exclaimed loudly to the people behind me, “i saw what it was! i can still see it, the image is burned into my eyes!” (i had to think a while on that because i’m sure i didn’t use the word, “after-image” even though i certainly should have).\r\n    although i was blinking my eyes, i still couldn’t see much. just the image of the white line. almost right away i felt hands pat’s hands on my arm on one side and my mom’s hands on the other steadying me. “do you want to sit down?” she asked. i really didn’t want to sit down, because there wasn’t anyplace to sit in their backyard and i would have to go inside. but my eyes were still so messed up i couldn’t even see the stars yet, so the ufos would be beyond my ability to see again. \r\n    i told everyone what had happened and pointed to the place where i had seen it. but it was either on the other side of a few trees in a group, or all the way across the road in the back on the company’s lot. a couple of the neighbors went looking in that direction, but didn’t find anything.\r\n    back in those days flashbulbs were still in use. one going off could dazzle the eyes for a few seconds. i remember thinking it had been like a whole row of flashbulbs going off at once.\r\n    i sat there for a while thinking about what i had seen. whatever it was had been moving, but it had gone so fast i had trouble figuring out if it had been coming or going. initially i had thought it had come down. looking back i think it was an instinctive thought. especially, since i hadn’t seen it there before. but the more i thought about it, the more i was sure it had taken off. it was more like the idea of which way it had gone, not something i could discern at the moment, but only reflect on later. years earlier i had used estes model rockets with my brother. i was familiar with how fast a model rocket can go. shortly after taking off from a pad a model rocket can achieve hundreds of miles per hour in just a few feet. what this thing had done was faster than that.\r\n    i didn’t go back outside until it was time to go home. my eyes were watering and still messed up too much to see the softly glowing lights in the sky. but within ten or twenty minutes of seeing the bright light, the other lights faded away one by one and with the show over we caught a ride back home. the next day my eyes were back to normal.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet

cleary spherical shape. my father is not a believer of extra terrestrial life, but he also served in the air force reserves as a mechanic and has told me that he has never heard of or seen any aircraft that was like what we saw that night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

and everything. she left to go to the bathroom inside. recently i had been looking into ufo's and had come across this stuff about apollo 18-20 and i thought it was interesting, so while she was gone i decided i was going to ask her if she believed in aliens. so, sure enough, she gets back and i ask her. as we talk about the subject, not 10 seconds go by when i look to my west (off the porch)and begin looking at the few bright stars out. my eyes go from one to the other but at the third or forth star, my eyes just lock and stare at it. and out of nowhere, as if out of the movie chicken little, a (at first very hard to make out) craft with 7 lights on it just appears and begins moving to the left (s=>n/ne). it was a very distinct shape. a 3 armed boomerang. each arm had a light at the end and one at the middle. the center light, that had apparently been the star i was looking at was slightly dimmer than the others.The craft started moving very slowly and looked pitched, kind of at an angle with its bottom toward me. but then it began to accelerate slowly as i began to realize what i was looking at. as it accelerated, it began to spin very slowly. this is how i knew it was a solid craft. as the lights were moving exactly together as on a single object. i ran to the railing and watched it continue out of my sight blocked by the roof. and i could make out the very dark outline when contrasted by the blue/black of the night sky that night. my friend did not see it but does mention seeing a flash.  i think this is when it first appeared and maybe she just saw the ambient light from the craft. the lights weren't solid also. they were kind of fuzzy, hard to describe.You had to be looking exactly where i was looking in order to see this thing. after the encounter, i immediately drew a picture from my head to get the proportions right before my mind started altering them. also, after i explained everything that i saw to my friend, she got a call from an unknown number. it was a women, who kind of didn't answer when my friend picked up the phone. so after 10 seconds, i grabbed asked who it was and this lady asked if i was, might spell it wrong,(maliek salie?). i told her she had the wrong number and she laughed and i hung up. she sounded really strange and expressive. i'm not sure what that means, just thought that was creepy.

triangular lights at night in the daly city ca area. i was about 30 miles from home at the time. i lived in sunnyvale ca at the time. when i got home and parked in the driveway, stepped out of my car and looked up, there again was the triangular lighted object. it had tracked me home. i freaked out at first and jumped back in my car. these lights were about cloud level, hovering. ever since that night and every night after till this day, 8 years later, these lighted objects make themselves visible to me. they fly in front of, usually left to right, they want to be seen by me. they are better seen flying from the drivers side of the car. they will either speed up or slow up so that at some point they are flying directly in front of me. to any other eye, they may look like a regular aircraft. i know aircraft pretty well, being a aircraft parts clerk at one time. sometimes at night, i go out and play games with these things, no matter what direction i turn, these lighted objects will show up, 100% guaranteed. sometimes they will fly on the side of me, drivers side, to be easily seen. they seem to know were i'm at all the time. as soon as i drive out of my complex, they will show up, guaranteed. i've gotten use it, as bazaar as it is. at times, it gets irritating , because i can't figure out what they are doing or what they want. it's just bazaar. knowing the flight patterns of commercial aircraft in the area, these objects fly all over the place, where commercial aircraft don't fly. i live on the 2nd floor of a condo, and from my bedroom, i see these objects fly, usually from left to right. i have put my telescope on them, all i can make out is the lights, the object itself seems invisible, totally transparent to the sky. if i take a photo, some are very distorted, i had a few good ones come out, but just the lights and most of the time they will go to a blinking light mode or just go totally dark. these aircraft do amazing things, things that earthly aircraft cannot do. i been dealing with this for 8 years and i don't know what to make of it all. i hope that somebody can witness what i been witnessing for the past 8 years, every single night, it

was working alone finishing a house at a fairly remote area, keeping my own hours. the house had wood heat. the time was mid winter with a foot of  compact snow on the ground. i worked out of a small wood shop close to the house. my schedule was somewhat erratic so i kept a log book of what type of work was done and how many hours labor i had performed each day. this book was updated daily or at least every other day. \r\ni had been working there about 5 weeks. \r\ni had been off to town the previous weekend (picking up supplies) and had returned sunday night. monday i was working in the shop and things were going well. the next thing i was standing in the house, confused as if i had just come out of a fog. i did not recall how i got there, i just seemed to appear. the house looked dusty and un-lived in, like when you come home from a holiday and no one has been around. i felt i could not get my bearings as if i had just had an electric shock. i could not figure out what day it is. i turned on the radio and it was friday morning, about 10:30 am. i tried to reason out what was going on, to get my bearings and i could not. oddly my log book was open to that day; friday. \"what had i been doing?\" i asked myself. i turned the book to thursday and there was nothing written. \"oh well\" i said to myself; this occasionally happened, usually i write every day. i turned to wednesday; nothing. i was starting to worry, i had never missed two days before. i turned to tuesday and nothing, monday nothing. i went to the previous friday (before going to town) and looked at the work written. this was the last work done. i could remember nothing from monday noon. i checked the shop and everything was as it should be as of monday. nothing has been done since monday noon. back to the house. the food i packed in the fridge sunday night had not been touched, the firewood i stacked sunday night against the house was there so there was no wood burnt, yet the house was not freezing. the house was in a state of stasis, not cold but not warm. i examined myself and i was warm and dry (i had not been out in the snow). i looked at my vehicle and the tracks in the snow. i could see that i had not driven since sunday and no one had driven in. there were no footprints in the snow but mine. i was not hungry or dehydrated, yet i was wearing the same clothes as i was on monday. i was not smelly or dirty.\r\ni now feel that i was under a post-hypnotic suggestion because a voice in my head said over and over \"i must have been here working....I must have been here working.... on and on. within an hour of appearing back on monday i falsely wrote in work hours for the missing four days. this still bothers me since i pride myself on my honesty. during the writing i knew i had not done the work, because there was nothing done. the work was linear, one step after another and i was clearly inventing false labor. yet i continued. \r\ni kept this log book for years, yet my falsehood was so effective that i could not identify which week this occurred! eventually i threw the book out since i could not decipher it and it just bothered me more. \r\nlife went on and i convinced myself that it had just been fatigue, in spite of the surrounding evidence. \r\nsix months later i had a dream where i was back and i knew it was the monday of the event. i was in my shop and a voice in my head told me that i should go to the lake. it seemed like it was my idea. i walked to the lake and looked up. there was a hole in the sky somewhat like an enormous saturn. it was as if i could see through to the stars as if a portal. the \"stars\" were brilliant and dense. i was confused as to what i was seeing; not a solid object but a void. i stared then the thought came \"i'm seeing a ufo! i was happy and excited, i had always wanted to see one! the millisecond i had the thought, an electric shock shot through me from my head to my toes and i was awake sitting up in my bed. this all happened at the same time. i immediately realized that i knew what happened the winter before. oddly enough i had not even been dwelling on it much.

was very strange was there was a round/barreled object following the jet by moving from under neath the wing and then moving upto the rear of the jet near the rudder. this thing was silent except for the turbines on the jet. it was large and like a barrel similar too a oil drum. but had ridges around the front/back of it. we watched it for sometime. i had just had laser treatment because of diabetic retinopaty. it looked like too me like it had some sort of glow around it. it seemed like some kind of field around this sighting. my wife did not see this what i saw and i've always thought it might be because of my laser work i had on my eyes. at that time i saw very well! but except for the funny glow around it we both saw what i have said. what i don't understand is why the jet wasn't affected by this large thing moving around it's lift source, and the jet wash. this plane might have been landing at brantford,ont,canada airport which was around 6-7 miles away from our house. someone please get back too me about this event from mufon only please, and if there were other reports of this type of sightings? wish i had my 35mm, or my vhs camcorder, but wasn't enough time too load camera etc.\r\n\r\n                                        sincerely,\r\n                                                 mike... :)","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

over their car to film this event. apparently it was unusual enough to catch their attention since they are familiar with the area. she told me put if the 3 lights, one appeared suddenly. i say 3 because there is a faint one to the right of the main 2\r\nshe focused in and they appear closer and out of focus. i looked into airplane flashing patterns and none match what filmed. i also asked about drones on ine if there forums and was told their lights cant be turned on one at a time, which happened un thus video. you dont see this in the video but that is what happened according to my niece. i was told they pulled over because of the object was hovering and eas about 300 yards away above the treetreeline. then they said the objectflew toward them and overhead. after this happened a few days later they thought it was 2 planes flying pasr each other. i di not see that watching the video. its best you see the video to see if you think this looks like an airplane or airplanes.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
