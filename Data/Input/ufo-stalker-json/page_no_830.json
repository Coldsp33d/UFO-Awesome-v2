have no idea\".  \r\n\r\nour other friends came rushing up to us and said, \"did you see that thing\"...We crossed the road and watched as the object continued to move over lake mahopac.  it then turned, as if it was on an axis and headed out of our sight.   \r\n\r\nas i sated, my family (and other friends) had seen multiple sightings during the years, but we never really had the technology to report as we do now.  this one encounter has stayed with me.  no one could adequately explain what i saw that night....What i do know, is that there was no way it was planes or ultralights.  i used to live not far from the mahopac airport and would hear prop planes travel all the time near our home....There were air national guard bases in newburgh and stewart airport.  we saw planes and military jets of all types in our area and i can differentiate between them.\r\n\r\nthis object was too large, too quiet and traveled too slowly to be an aircraft of any type found on this planet.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

not.\r\nthe disc had a beam that shone down onto a rock in my backyard. i put my hand on the rock.  since then i've had 5 surgeries on my hand the blood clotted to it and have been diagnosed with rare form of lupus.\r\nwhat i want to convey is that in a short period of time my head was filled with a ton of information,some i wrote to you about but there is so much i can't even say it all it would take forever.  i tried to describe important things,but one thing i forgot to mention thats bothering me is that i was shown that this species has been coming to earth for ever.  they used to have to wear protection because they couldn't survive in our atmosphere.  they have been taking genes from us and have over many generations mutated their genes with ours so they can be on our planet without protection.  it took them a long time to do this and get it right so biologically they can survive our bacteria and atmosphere.  i was shown they are also changing the \"animals\" or other species on their planet to be able to biologically allow them to survive.  the ultimate goal is to share our planet theirs is much older and dying.  why i was shown all these things,i have no idea. i am nobody.  i saw their written letters and a lot of things.  i wasn't afraid,my hand was like when you grab an electric fence and can't let go but it didn't hurt at the time.  i don't know whether i was in the right place at the right time or the wrong place at the wrong time,but there is no other reason for showing me this information.  like i said,i will never tell anyone,except i heard of you and thought you may want to know.\r\nthanks for your time,\r\ndenise.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line

stepped out of the kitchen i smelled a strong odor of ozone. thinking it unusual because of the clear weather, i walked out onto the front deck to look for an incoming storm. it was about a half hour before sunset and the weather had been beautiful all day. i could observe no clouds or precipitation what so ever. i went back in and was watching something on t.V. for about 5 minutes when i smelled the odor again. i asked my friends if they could smell it, and had to explain what ozone smelled like, and they replied no to smelling anything unusual. so i was very puzzled and i decided to go outside on the front deck again and look for any lightning or thunderstorm activity. i stood outside for a few minutes searching the sky and had not noticed any but i could still smell ozone. it was so beautiful outside and the sun was near setting and very soon i was just observing the sunset and watching the stars becoming visible. that's when i first noticed an object flying in a straight path sw to ne with a trajectory crossing directly over head. at first i thought it was a satellite because it was small and shined bright white like a star but didn't twinkle, and was moving across the sky at high speed. i observed no vapor, smoke or any kind of trail and it appeared to be at an extremely high altitude of at least 50,000ft., but it could've been several hundred thousand feet because i could not tell what it was or how big it was. it continued on a path almost directly overhead and past me until it stopped and hovered for a moment at about 70deg. above the ne horizon. then it vibrated for a few minutes gradually exaggerating the vibrations until it reached a point of actual zig-zagging in random directions in an area, if you held your hand up at arms length and looked between the thumb and forefinger spread apart, about 2 inches. then it disappeared with a very bright orb shaped flash about the size of a nickle and a ripple effect on the sky (similar to that of a pond's surface if you were to toss a pebble in) and reappeared a couple of feet away (at altitude) instantaneously. it repeated this action many times gradually increasing frequency until about a 6ft. by 4ft. area of the sky was covered with dissapating ripples. it continued doing this at a pace that resembles that of constant fireworks exploding (like the bright flash and booming type at typical shows) for many minutes. i rushed back inside and exclaimed for my friends to come look but they would not. so i went back out alone and observed this object continue doing these actions for several more minutes until it suddenly stopped and hovered again for a moment and then resumed it's original flight path at resumed speed. as i was it watching fly toward the ne i noticed another identicle object on the same path and speed going in the opposite direction. they passed each other and both continued on until they were out of sight over the horizons. neither objects made any noticeable noise during the entire time. the whole event seemed to take only about 7 or 8 minutes but when they were gone i went in and discovered nearly an hour had passed. then for several weeks a strange effect on my eyesight was very noticeable, occasionally i could see for miles with almost binocular like vision. i didn't report this right away because after explaining it to several people over the next couple of months, everyone who would listen treated me like i was going crazy. today i learned that other people had reported ufo's in the same town on that same weekend. so i decided to give you my report. i remember it like it was last weekend. one friend came out when i called him when the first object was flying over and he observed it saying \"i don't know what that is.\" and when it stopped and started the zig-zag maneuvers he got a frightened look on his face and quickly rushed back into the house and never again mentioned a single word of the whole incident, not even when i was telling our other friends about it. i think he perhaps believes that we imagined it. he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer though.","distance":"Over One

river that separates oklahoma from texas. i had a specific overhang close to the top of the bluff where i could see from horizon to horizon. approximately at 7:30 in the morning i caught site of an enormous object following a line straight west to east nearly over the red river. instantly, i asked my hunting partner if he thought the object could be some sort of missle on its way to iraq. the closer the object got to us, we could tell, without a doubt, that this was no missle or any kind of manmade aircrft. i was able to watch this object for a few minutes. there was no sound and no sign

caused us to look up. there above us was some object that looked metallic but wasn't decernable as to how large it was nor how high it was over our heads. but it looked metallic as the lights from the airport taxi and runways were reflecting off of it. slowly it moved toward the west and out of sight. later as i was driving and listening to the radio the program was interupted by a report of a meteor being spotted west of palos verdes and near catalina island. witnesses said it left a  green trail and looked like it hit the ocean near catalina. \r\ni have never reported this prior and only do so now after viewing the history channel program about possible underwater ufo bases near catalina island.
