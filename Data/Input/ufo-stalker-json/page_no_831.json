i know i already reported one already, and it could've been nothing, but i felt i had to report this one again.  this time it happened in my hometown and it looked like the same lights that we saw when travelling home from thunder bay, but this time it was lower, and moved slower, and it travelled above me going north.  i didn't notice it right away when it was over me.  there was this guy yelling down the street about 400 yards from me \"to look up there was something above\" but i didn't pay attention to him i just thought he was randomly yelling around.  until i got closer to him and he said \"look up look at that light, how can u not see it was right above u\" by this time the object was about maybe 100 yards from me travelling north.  i tried to record it, and i got a little bit. and my cell was messing up it wouldn't focus on it, and once i thought i got it fixed, i tried to get a better and closer video but when i made it inside to view it the other two videos were blue/ black static, but the sound was on.  this orange reddish light looked like a glowing ball of gas or something travelling in like a zig zag motion like it was bobbing, but the other object i seen two weeks ago was travelling in speeds that were unreal, now this object was the same but it was lower and slower, there wasn't any noise.  i watched this thing fly away for about 10 minutes our community is only 1 square mile, and it took like 5 minutes till i couldn't see it anymore cause of trees... we are a remote community and there are no planes or helicopters are any objects that can create this.  even for the object i saw 2 weeks ago the highway we were travelling is deserted. and i don't think any drones would wanted to fly over at a low altitude for any reason.  ok so i wasnt going to report this incident, if it wasn't for the feeling that i felt afterwards.  my head was buzzing and when i would touch it a buzzy feeling radiated throughout like my hair.  and i woke up this morning with a huge migraine and i'm not one to get bad headaches, and it's been pulsating all day and still, i tried to take tylenol with codeine but it hasn't helped.  ok i just want to metion something, i am not one to pay attention to ufo's and what not and i would rationalize everything.  but seeing the same craft in a two week span and seeing it the second time where i live and it flying low, above me, and at a slow speed, and then feelings my head tingle like that afterwards, and now the huge migraine i have really freaks me out.  i didn't want to report this again a buty friend encouraged me to even post the video... ok u can hardly see the light but i will explain where it is then after you'll be able to locate it in the video.  thank u for overlooking my report, it may seem like nothing to a lot of people, but i'm starting to believe this stuff.  and just thought i should share.\r\n\r\nyou will be able to locate it once the lights from the house appear, and look up to the left you should be able to see it, like i said my camera couldn't catch it although i was practically right under it.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

wanted to report some additional info and i can not find an email confirming that you received my report so i will start over.\r\n\r\nsometime in feb. of 2014 i was camped in my rv in owl canyon just north of barstow. i was sitting at the front windshield watching the stars when the first light came into view over the ridge to the sw. the rv was facing south so the lights were moving directly in front of me toward the ne. the lights continued to appear one after the other until all of them were in view. to my left was another ridge. when the first light reached a point about half way between the ridges i began to hear a faint but clear whirring sound. the first thing to come to mind was the sound i have heard from a blimp. within a few seconds and as the string of lights grew longer i thought it might be an ultralight craft pulling the lights with a tether. i discarded that because there was absolutely no wavering to the lights as they remained in a straight line and maintained position related to each other. the dots blow show the position of the lights.\r\n\r\n                             .   \r\n    ne           .   .   .     .   .           sw\r\n                           .\r\n\r\nthey were moving right to left and maintaining the relationship to each other as shown above. the lights were all red and the last light to the right also had a blinking red light. i could not see a structure, only lights. since first reporting this i have done some research on owl canyon and it is about 2000 ft between the 2 ridges. the formation covered the whole distance so this would mean the lights were about 400 ft apart from one another. i watched this for about 5 minutes so the speed must have been around 5 mph. i estimate the altitude at 300 ft. the lights appeared to be perfect squares somewhere around 12 ft x 12 ft. as the last light reached the ridge on the left then they all turned bright white except the last one which remained red. after a few seconds they all simply disappeared. at first i could not believe what i was seeing but over time the more i think about this i am convinced the lights were attached to each other in a rigid structure. i know what i saw, i just don't know what it was. one other thing, after looking at a map, i see that edwards afb is directly to the sw of my position at the time.\r\n\r\n

returned to my parent's house with my aunt, who also resided at this residence. my aunt parked in the driveway near the backyard and the first thing to catch our eye, among the circular grove of trees, was thousands of lightning bugs. looking around, we noted that there were no lightning bugs anywhere else, only in our backyard. it looked like a light show of twinkling christmas lights. but i did find it strange that the lightning bugs were only congregating in our backyard and nowhere else. my friend and i hadn't caught lightning bugs in a couple of years. afterall, we were 14. but seeing this light spectacle, made us run in the house, grab a couple of jars, poke holes in the top, and run to the backyard. my aunt stayed in the house to watch television with my mother and father. my friend and i began crawling around the backyard, scooping lightning bugs into our jars. in less than 5 minutes, i must have had a hundred lightning bugs in my jar. i stood up, and held my jar up in the air to look at it because it was glowing like a bright greenish lantern. however, when i looked up, i saw a dark, disc shaped object, with flashing lights spinning around it. it was approximately 100 ft. above my head at the time but, appeared to be slowly and silently descending. the glow of lights on the disc, did not cast light or shadows on the ground, even though they were brightly lit. the color and glow of the lights on the disc, very much resembled the glow of the lightning bugs. and, the thousands of lightning bugs that had been there moments before, were now gone. when i saw the disc silently descending, my first thought was \"oh my god! it's a flying saucer\". i was 14 and not frightened at all. but, when i told my friend to look up, she had the opposite reaction. she began to scream. she flapped her arms, and threw herself on the ground, crying. i began loudly yelling for my mother and father; i wanted them to see this. strangely, it was a hot summer night, our neighbors were close by, all their windows were open, and yet no one responded to the loud commotion we were making. only my mother emerged from our house. the first words out of her mouth were, \"oh my god\"! she began calling for my father and aunt to come out but they never did. the three of us stood and watched the silent, glowing disc descend from about 100 ft, to no more than 8ft above our heads. my mother realized that my friend and i were still directly below the disc. she told me later that she feared that the disc might have been there to abduct us. my mother began shouting to us from the driveway. she said, \"i think it's trying to land. it can't land with you two right under it so, back up so it can land\". my friend and i backed up, and the disc descended a couple more feet like it was going to land but it didn't. it hovered silently for over 15 mins. my friend was still in a panic, face down on the ground, not looking. my mother and i were curious and intrigued. we tried to peer beyond the windows of the disc to see inside but all we could see were a couple of dark figures. the figures were either wearing helmets or had huge heads but we could only see them in shadow-like form. at this point we, including the disc, were all silent, anticipating what would happen next....Hoping something remarkable would happen. but, after hovering for about 15 mins., the disc began to ascend, slowly and silently. when it reached approximately 100 ft in the air, it suddenly shot straight up into the sky, until it was just a tiny ball of light no bigger than a star. we then watched it leave the sky, in what i call start/stop movements because it would fly/stop, fly/stop. it changed direction several times after a stop but, it always flew straight, never in a curve or arc....Just straight. it was gone from the sky in less than 3 seconds. i am not sure how fast it was travelling to leave our sight in less than 3 seconds. i did know, even then, that i had never seen anything travel that fast in our world. my mother's comment then was, \"they came from far beyond this world\". after we lost sight of the disc, we ran in the house to see why my father and my aunt had refused to come outside. they sat staring at the television, and the only answer they gave was, \"i don't know\", in unison. my friend, on the other hand, who was obviously traumatized began saying that she saw nothing. she never again, to this day, admitted witnessing the most fantastic thing that my mother and i had ever seen. we never reported what we saw but, the day after we saw the flying disc, we saw a small article in our local paper that stated that someone reported seeing an object fly overhead, extremely fast.They also noted the start/stop movements, and the fact that it would  change direction.  my mother is 97 years old now and still sharp as a tack but, sadly, we never got to tell our story to anyone who cared. my mother and i have talked about what we witnessed at least once a week for the past  46 yrs. it has never left our mind for even a moment. i just wish we could tell our story while i still have my mother to back up the details. i hate to see a remarkable but true story, lost to history.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

persons own eyes it is never forgotten. \r\ni was driving home from lasalva beach when i saw it descending. there was a full moon that night and there was also quite a bit of light from the near by cities as well in that area. this area there is only about 1/4 mile between old hiway 1 and the freeway between santa cruz and watsonville. i pulled off the road to look at it as i could instantly see it was not a helicopter or airplane i knew of. i got out of my car and it landed about 100 yards away. i ran through the high grass to get a closer look and managed to get a little less than 100 feet from it. \r\nit had what looked like windows i could see  what looked like what we would call the grays now days. the inside of the craft was brightly lite so i couldn't see any details. mostly just there outlines. shortly after that it lifted off and flew tword santa cruz very slowly. what ever or who even did not leave the craft while it was landed. i was living with a buddy at the time and i told him when i got home. he was interested it it too and so the next morning we went back out there and sure enough we found 6 square imprints about 12 x 10 inches where the ground was smashed down about 2 inches deep. that's all i can say because at that time i knew no one that would want to investigate it further. there  is a movie that came out about twelve years later that had a scene at the end. i could not believe how close that ufo was to what i had seen that night. the move was called strange invaders. naturally it had nothing to do with what i had seen because in the 60's there was

 \r\n\r\nthey stayed a constant red color. the only thing that changed was the intensity of the red.  eventually the first one moved into a fog bank and disappeared or just went out. the second one did the same thing.  we watched for another half hour or so waiting to see if they would reappear but they did not.  \r\n\r\ni am not sure what we saw but it was something.  we did not hear any sounds coming from them but neighborhood dogs were barking like crazy and seemed agitated while they were around.  if it was a lantern then it could not move that fast and change direction. a laser would not be a triangle shape.  it is a mystery!!
