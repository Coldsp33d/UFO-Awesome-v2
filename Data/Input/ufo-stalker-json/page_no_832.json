language.\r\n\r\nthis was my very first sighting of any kind. i had experienced some weird situations or events in the \r\n\r\npast but in terms of seeing anything unsual or weird outdoors, this is was the first time.\r\n\r\ni saw an orb of brigh light in the air outdoors (but not in the sky or closer to it) at the end of san \r\n\r\nluis street in the city of faro, algarve, portugal. it was on a monday, 15th september of 2014 at 8:30 \r\n\r\npm from this coordinates (37.024195, -7.923251). i saw it flying around 10/11 meters in hight from the \r\n\r\nground and it was like 20/30 meters away from me in distance. it just crossed the street i was walkin \r\n\r\nin, from the right to the left, in a perfect horinzontal straigh line trajetory or path (about like 5 \r\n\r\nmeters) at a very slow velocity (around 10km/h), like the velocity of a bike going slow. it was just \r\n\r\nseen for a few seconds, 3 to maybe 5 and of a sudden it was gone, not leaving any trail. i did't see it \r\n\r\nshrink, it just went out of my sight of sudden, just like when someone turn off the light in a room. \r\n\r\nyou dont see it shrink or the light bulb going away, it just simply goes out of sight. that's what \r\n\r\nhappen, just after when i saw just for a few seconds. the 'orb' was a circle of light perfectly round \r\n\r\nwith about 5, 6 cm in diameter (without any kind of sparks around it), it had a brigh white light very \r\n\r\nintense, of just one color, and didn't leave any trail.\r\n\r\nin faro city, it wasnt dark already. it was that dark blue just before it goes black so i could still \r\n\r\nsee the buildings, houses and the sky perfectly. i was walking on the street on my way home (i dont do \r\n\r\nit very often, just from time to time, i go for a walk to some place and then return home) and usually \r\n\r\ni walk lookin down to see where i step in, and of a sudden something made me to look and raise my head, \r\n\r\nnot to the front, but up because i realised that something bright was flying just a few meters away \r\n\r\nfrom me. it was an automatic and instinctive behavior. the street where it happens has houses (1st \r\n\r\nfloor) of both sides and whatever that crossed that night it just passed over just a few meters in \r\n\r\nhight above the roofs/balconys of the houses. there was nobody else in street and there was no cars \r\n\r\ndriving by either on that moment.\r\n\r\ni confessed that i never whitness anything like it, but right in the moment we think that it is \r\n\r\nsomthing caused by our eyes or our tired head. but truth is, i saw it and follow its movement for \r\n\r\naround seconds and of a suden it was gone. it wasnt any kind of flying entertainment instrument/toy \r\n\r\nthat i would have known of. and i discard aswell any kind of soap bubble lightened by the streets \r\n\r\nlamps. by the informations of the distances and hights already mentioned, the chance of being any kind \r\n\r\nof plane, helicopter, satelite, chinese flahslight, led ballon, laser, meteorite or star is definetly \r\n\r\nout of question in my mind. there was no possibility of recording due to its brief appearance.\r\n\r\ni can reveal that for my own experience that during the sighting and in a fraction of seconds, the mind \r\n\r\ntries incessantly for an answer for whatever the eye is seeing but after exclusion after exclusion (is \r\n\r\nnot a ballon, not a bug, not a toy, not a lantern, not a laser, etc), when the phenomen just stops, the \r\n\r\nmind become even further and more perplexed than when it just faced with the problem. simply because, \r\n\r\nall plausible assumptions (that the mind got in its database) were simply set aside. the mind couldn't \r\n\r\ncoincide or make sense, whatever it was, with absolutly anything that i have seen live or making part \r\n\r\nof our known and 'apparent' world or physical reality.\r\n\r\nright after the sighting, i tried to memorize in my mind the 'visual image' of what i just whitnessed \r\n\r\nand being just 2 minutes away from home walkin, i was already thinkin what kind of device or phenomenon \r\n\r\n could resemble such thing, in order to search on internet when i get home. just before thinkin of a \r\n\r\nparanormal possibility, i though first to certify if there was actually nowdays any kind of toy or \r\n\r\n'drone' ressembling what i saw. of course that my eyes, knew what they saw and perfectly knew that it \r\n\r\nwas not toy but my rational mind wanted by all means to find an explanation for it. cause one thing is \r\n\r\nto see those whitish circles in pics (those typical called 'orb's of dust that show on photographs), \r\n\r\nanother is to whitness with your own eyes a circle of light passing just through your eyes not too far \r\n\r\naway. i knew it would be probably very dificult of find something similar in video on internet, cause i \r\n\r\nhad the true belief that that thing wasnt a device/toy.\r\n\r\nalthough i was unable to capture it on video, to my big surprise when i arrived home, i simply digited \r\n\r\non my pc 'bright orb' and on a video search, i could found exactly what i was lookin for, exactly what \r\n\r\ni saw. i couldnt believe my eyes. after all, that circle of light outdoors minutes ago, wasnt a product \r\n\r\nof my mind, it wasny my eyes playing tricks on me. if this thing is captured on video, therefore it \r\n\r\nwasnt an alucination i just had. whatever it was, it happened and i saw it. gezzz, iam not crazy. (i \r\n\r\nthought, ;)\r\n\r\nits important to say that i never across or saw in my entire life these type of light orbs in any \r\n\r\nvideos. for sure ive seen ufo docs through the years on tv but never came across to these type of light \r\n\r\nballs in any videos. ufos to me were synonymous of 'flying metal machines', those flying saucer crafts \r\n\r\ndrive by those little aliens creatures so usually portrayed in such docs or movies. these type of \r\n\r\n'light orb' thing i never saw it on tv or any media, it it was the case, i would for sure would have it \r\n\r\nrecognise in the first place in street. it was simpy the most weird thing ever i just saw in my entire \r\n\r\nlife. it was just for a few seconds but it made me very interested to find out what on earth was that.\r\n\r\ni'll leave though some links found on internet that shows in a very accurately way, what i just \r\n\r\nwhitness in faro (city), but in faro it was seen with a much lower altitude than what its shown in the \r\n\r\nvideos.\r\n\r\ni confessed that when i first saw it, i really though it was something psychic or illusory (cause i \r\n\r\njust came from hospital that night from a visit and my mind could be, who knows, a bit tired). but \r\n\r\ncould my eyes created all of that? fact is, that later as i mentioned, i searched for it on internet \r\n\r\nand i find and see the same 'orbs' in videos already taped by other people and realise that this is \r\n\r\napparently a phenomenon that is already happening at a worldwide level for so many years already.\r\n\r\nwhether or not these videos are real, all i can say is that they're truly similar to what i saw, and as \r\n\r\ni mentioned, i didn't have any knowledge about the balls of light in video whatsoever, and specially in \r\n\r\nsuch particular and unsual way, just right in the middle of the street or sky. ive never experienced so \r\n\r\nfar nothing of the genus, so iam still considering to which point this phenomenon is real or common \r\n\r\neither in portugal or in any other places of the world. and iam not talking about a tiny luminous dot \r\n\r\nflying above my head just like a plane or something similar.\r\n\r\na circle of light with 5/6cm in diameter (size of a tenis ball) just crossed and appeared in front of \r\n\r\nme at 10 meters hight (about the size of an apartment with 3,4 floors cause thats what mine has), just \r\n\r\na few meters away from me in the middle of the street, without making any sound. it didnt look \r\n\r\nspherical, it didnt had an spherical format, it look like a plane circle, because it was only from one \r\n\r\ntone of light, without any shadows, therefor without any tridimensional appearance. but it was a tone \r\n\r\nof light so strong that i dont remember seeing anything like it, and as strange and weird as it seems, \r\n\r\nit was perfectly definite. i could only compare the intensity of light to the scoocer/football stadium \r\n\r\nlights, but if you try to look at them, we can barely look at, cause we get to see all the reflections \r\n\r\nand sparks shoting in all directions. it wasnt the case with the orb. though it was very very bright, i \r\n\r\ncould stare at it for a millions years if it let me, it didnt hurt or blinded my eyes as a car's light \r\n\r\nwould, though the light of the 'orb' was very very powerful.\r\n\r\npersonaly i dont have a big belief of the existence of extraterrestial lifes/beings similar to ours, in \r\n\r\nwhich some kind of other humanoids races come to visit us or to spy us but after what i jsut saw, i \r\n\r\ndont discard the possibility of the existence of another type of existences or energeitc \r\n\r\nentities/organisms to which we are not awake for or have knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese are some videos i found (not mine), note that the light color shown on the videos is nothing like \r\n\r\nin real life. the 'orb' is like 100x brighter than it shows on video:\r\n\r\n1º italy -

was like lights ejecting and hovering around it then disappearing.  we stopped to record it, and my sister was like \"oh maybe it's a helicopter\" but obviously the short distance we'd hear a helicopter.  this thing was silent.  for about a minute we recorded it, then it took off, within 2 seconds it was a mile up the river.  so we were driving along and we caught up to it again.  we didn't stop this time, but it started following and going along with us.  then again it zoomed about a mile and a half up that river, same thing within two seconds.  we caught up to it again, but this

the bedroom and were ready for sleep.  in the darkened room i noticed a single flash of light through a window shade in the corner of the room; the shades were pulled down.  i didn’t give it much thought.  we live at the end of a cul-de-sac and when vehicles make the circle at night the rooms of our house are lit by the headlights.  this was not like that but i didn’t recognize it as unusual at the time.  maybe a minute after the first flash i saw a second one.  i did notice that the pattern of light on the shade was more of a spotlight, not a flood light pattern.  it made a light on the shade about the size of a small coffee saucer.  i still was not moved to check it out.  after another minute or so there was another flash.  i asked my wife who was in bed and had had her eyes closed during the earlier flashes if she saw the last flash of light.  she did see that one.  now i was moved to see what might be going on outside.  i arose from bed and opened the window shade at the front corner of the house where the flashes had occurred.  while looking through the window into the dark yard in the direction that it appeared the flashes were coming from, i was surprised by a bright flash of intense white light that appeared to come from something about 10-15 feet from where i was standing.  it appeared to be near or just beyond the end of the front porch.  the diameter of the flash appeared to be the same size as a 1”-2” circle held at the end of my outstretched arm.  i was able to discern what looked like a very bright zig-zag line, brighter than the rest of the light, like a light bulb filament, in the center of the flash.  the flash lasted only a moment.  it was not the kind of flash we’ve all seen from camera flash units that fill your field of view with very bright light that then temporarily blind you.  even though very bright it did not blind me or result in me seeing spots of light in my vision.  i looked intently to try to see what had made the light but nothing was visible.  i put down the shade and got into bed.  (my wife says i went outside to check it out but i have no recollection of that.)  my wife and i considered that someone was playing with a drone but our house is surrounded by a fairly dense stand of trees and shrubs and the yard has a quite dense tree canopy that would present a challenge, i presume, for most drone operators.  there was no obvious sound associated with the flashing lights.  i turned off the night lamp and we went to sleep.\r\nthe next morning i was struck by my seeming lack of curiosity the night before about the final flash that occurred so close to me.  why was i able to so easily go to sleep so soon after the incident?  also the discrepancy in our observations about whether i went outside to check it out or not.  and lastly, our trusty dachshund, which sleeps in our bedroom and is very sensitive to outside sounds, did not rouse.  if someone had been playing with flashlights outside, he would have heard it.\r\nwe checked with the next door neighbor on march 31, 2014.  she had not seen nor heard anything on march 29.  however, the next neighbor over did notice one flash of light on her bedroom curtain some night earlier but couldn’t be sure of the date.  she just thought it had happened some time in the preceding week.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":64353,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.330875885741264,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03312015-0019","longitude":-95.50563289939137,"occurred":1427697900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1427869189000,"summary":"Observed flashing light on bedroom blinds, then observed single flash of light approx 15 ft from window.","tags":["flash","light"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"77304","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Conroe, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:46359"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Bristol","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"What if you actually encountered something,would you go to the government, or keep it secret? can anyone actually be trusted?

i noticed a brilliant green object descend in about a second of time from an angle of about 80° in the night sky.  it appeared to be similar to a meteor, we know that this is not possible under 12 miles altitude.  this was seen through our living room window.   the direction was 333° or roughly nnw.  the object appeared at about 17° height from the horizon, and when it had descended to 12° it hived off at least one smaller object that continued in the same direction as the main larger craft.\r\n\r\nthey would likely have entered blue springs lake at about 343°.  at approximately 1 mile distance, and covering a descent of 834 feet in about a second before vanishing beyond the trees, the objects would have been travelling at a rate of approximately 569 mph.\r\n\r\nthese craft seem to have just become visible at the time that i saw them.  if they would have been visible longer, i would seem from their trajectory.  there is an upper group of windows higher in the great room as large as the one from which the craft was observed.  this leads me to believe that the larger craft appeared, or materialized just before entering the area of the lake.  one can only speculate as to the mechanism of travel.  however the objects have entered once again in nearly the same area as the three previous craft from may 1, september 12, and october 15, 2014.\r\n\r\nthe odds of four “meteor” like objects descending ablaze in the same vicinity within yards of each other is 1,217,853.9 x 10256 to one.  the following seem to be the summarizing points:\r\n•\tthe plunging craft seem to have been traveling at a great speed due to the ionization.\r\n•\tthe objects are only visible for about a second or two.\r\n•\tthese craft materialize at approximately 2500 feet altitude.\r\n•\ton two of the occasions, the meteor like object has “hived off” another object.\r\n•\tprevious objects were brilliant yellow or whitish in color.  this was brilliant green, suggesting that it is made from different alloys.\r\n•\tthe craft head to nearly precisely the same location each time.\r\n•\tinterestingly, the star vega is nearby in each of the occurances.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

room window bright lights coming from the east and asked me to come and look, so i did.  we didn't think it looked like low flying plane or helicopter so we went outside to watch it. when we got outside it was obvious that it was something odd because it was very large and made absolutely no sound at all, totally silent. my wife ran inside and grabbed our binoculars and as soon as she looked at it through them she handed them to me and said \"that's not an airplane!\"  we watched the aircraft for approximately 3-4 minutes until it was out of sight.  i have attached an illustration defining the light arrangement. all lights were white except 2 red blinking lights.  i estimate the craft's altitude was approximately 2000-3000 feet and traveling approximately 100-200 knots.\r\nwe have spotted other strange aircraft in our area over the past 3 years but only a couple were extremely unusual.  however, usually after we notice something strange like this within the next day or two several blackhawk helicopters will be seen patrolling the area.  note: we are not close to any military bases or large airports but frequent sightings of unusual or unexplainable aircraft is not uncommon in our area. this is a rural area and mostly occupied by farmers and old order amish and he only thing close is a coal mine. however, about 30-40 years ago much of this area was strip-mined. in august 2012 i reported my 1st encounter to mufon and because it was such a life-changing experience for me, my wife and i continually watch the skies.  i am a disabled veteran and spend most of my time at home and even though 3 years have passed since my 1st encounter i cannot sleep more than 3-4 hours per night.  i never go to bed until 1 or 2 am and get up around 4:30-5:00. i am still struggling over it and finding that 1st experience very difficult to process.  there's more that i would like to talk about but i won't because nobody would believe me, (not even you !) life is very

the nights job. something caught my eye from the nw.  a shooting star.. so instantly i looked to that direction and watch the meteor break up into pieces this kne glowed bright green and had tons of debris coming off of it. it fizzled out and fell below the tree line and out of sight.  pretty neat i thought haven't seen to many of those in my life.  i looked down for a moment to place the gear shift in drive and as soon as i focused my sight on the road.  a orb of light shot straight up from behind the tree line exactly where the meteor had fizzled out at.  initially i thought perhaps it wasn't over but immediately recognized this object was going straight up in the air. these events happened extrely somountaniosly \"bang\" \"bang\" if you will. this object however continued up and up until it was abundantly clear this was not debris. it had a strange spiral like wobble and i cannot begin to explain the speed this shot up in the air at.  as it climbed it remained the same color. suddenly without slowing down it came to a hover and it illuminated to an extremely bright hyper blue color its light was actually reflecting off my vehicles hood. it then at a rapid speed disappeared behind the tree line and out of sight for the moment.  \r\n\r\ni turned left  onto  fire tower rd completed my deliveries on this road turned back north on silerton rd and the object was there again in the distance my distance cculation is just that is say perhaps a mile  from position to the direct west. it appeared to be moving how fast i could not judge i couldn't tell at the moment of it was moving towards me or away from me. knowing i had a different encounter on this same road a few months ago i felt more comfortable with or and dos not panic i chose to keep my eye on but continue my delivery route. in my rear view mirror i kept it in sight the object moved west to east then moved north directly behind me but quite a good distance between us.  at this point had to turn around as i turned around i lost sight of the object due to heavy tree cover.   i came to the spot again where i had initially spotted the object i stopped my  vehicle and looked in each direction and could not spot it.  i started to roll up my driver window and noticed my radio was complete static. having a nervous feeling i decided to just go home. as soon as i shifted to drive the object illuminated again
