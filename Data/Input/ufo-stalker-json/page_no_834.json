tree. it was a disc, sort of dome shaped with lights all around the bottom going around it. strangely enough, after 40+ years i recall that i was not afraid. all of a sudden it swooped up and moved at such speed in what seemed like seconds it has disappeared from my sight. we lived close to jfk airport so we were used to seeing airplanes all the time. i am as sure now, as i was back then, that what i saw was not an airplane or some military type aircraft.\r\n\r\nbecause of the stigma associated with these sightings we never even spoke about it amongst ourselves, let alone other people. i don't know if my brother remembers this incident, as he was really young and i lost touch with my friend after moving from the area. but i am sure of what i saw and would have loved to be hypnotized to

outside of town i was caught in a traffic jam as i was looking out the window to my left there was cows grazing in a pasture about  20 or so then i noticed an object above the cows about 25 yards it made now sound it was kinda a silver color or looked just like someone had blowed a big bubble the size of a house i first thought it was a reflection from the lake to my right so i rolled down my window and it was still there it made no sound the wind was blowing lightly in my direction from the way of the object but it just seemed like a natural wind i noticed no ordor from the unit it was just like the creature on the movie predator it reflected the objects from behind the craft and the only way i could tell it was there is that it distorted the things around it as it moved i watched it for about 3 minets then it either shot up and out of sight or it slightly moved streight up and disintergrated i dont know which i had written this down and tried to report this to the military all branches even the news but got no responce from anybody  i have tried seeveral times since 1997 to report this to proper authorities but nobody ever responded.I was not on any drugs then didnt even smoke cigeretts i have since seen something simurally on utube under ufo steals a cow in hawaii in i believe 2011 its on utube when i saw that video i about fell out of my chair thats exactly the same craft i saw back in 1997 i told my wife and family when i got home and they have agreed that the same ship i saw is the same as the one on utube i am not sure of what it is i suspect its a ship that
