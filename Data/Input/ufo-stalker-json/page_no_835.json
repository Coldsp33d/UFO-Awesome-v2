gary indiana, it was summer and hot. i set on a plat form outside until the mosquitoes started getting to me. so i asked my sister for the keys to her car and she gave them to me. i then got behind the driver seat, because to my right was a big tree i couldn't see over it in the car but i could see behind me, in front of me, and to my left. i played games on my phone so i wouldn't look crazy just sitting in the car looking up but i kept looking up. after about and hour i got bored lit a cigarette and opened the car door. i had stop playing my phone because i wanted too spot the mosquitoes i didn't want them in the car when i shut the door, but close to the end of my cigarette i saw a shadow move in front of me then back quickly. i looked up\r\nquickly and saw this triangular, disc like, unrealistic black type of material, with one red light, one green light, and a blue light one for each edge of the ship. as soon as i saw it i instantly got terrified for no reason though. i looked at it and then i panic and backed back into the car quickly hoping it didn't see me praying to myself like please god don't let it take me. all of a sudden i got calm because i wanted to see it that's why i was out there but when i got out the car it was down the road by the railroad tracks i looked at hoping it comes back but also hoping i don't get scared then it started flying away from slow to so fast i couldn't see it. and i remember going back in the house walking back and forth trying to figure out what happened and what it was and how it did all that stuff and we're it came from and what did it want and did it\r\ntake me and will it come back. so my sister told me to calm down its not real even if it is just forget it ever happened took her keys and went in the room. which i did but a couple nights later i had\r\na dream that brought me here. i had a dream that when i backed back into the car i was lifted in the air by this strange energy that felt like had me and i could get away but it didn't hurt but before i knew that i was screaming but it was like it was for no reason because no one did anything no one came out or nothing that's when i noticed it didn't hurt so i calmed down i don't know how long it took me to get up in the ship but i remember being ok on the ship but they were doing something to me i don't know what or who i felt sedated and whined up opening my eyes quickly remembering were i was and hearing them say something but because i knew i was out numbered out smarted and weak at the time i felt like my best bet was to treat them like friends an pray for her best so i asked them to fix my back i have (sluklyosous)[sorry i can't spell it hope you can pronounce it] and one of them told me he wouldn't and to kill me i might have been woke the whole time and then i woke up. i am telling you this because i fill like i know something i shouldn't. something that is smart and complex but\r\nalso simple. and doesn't belong in the wrong hands and

gaylesville, headed to ft. payne\r\n, al, when i suddenly noticed above the treetops, a speeding object.  it appeared at about the height that you would normally see a local  small aircraft, piper, cherokee, etc., but was very clearly not a plane or chopper.  it was actually flying over a large open pasture.  it seemed to be a solid white or shiny silver object, pod or egg shaped.  it had no projecting shapes, wings, rudders, etc.  no visible lights.  i'm certain it was fairly low,  500-1000 ft. because there was low cloud cover,  and as it sped north, it became hidden by the low clouds.  i watched for it the rest of the afternoon, hoping to get another glimpse of it.   i was so tempted to go to the nearby airport in ft. payne to see if they had received report of any such sighting by anyone else.   i  was 55 yrs old at the time and have been an avid aircraft enthusiast  most of my life and am very familiar with all sorts of craft, civilian and military and am certain this was something i'd never seen before.  i was so impressed by the speed and the silence with which it flew at such a low altitude.  i will never forget that sight.     i researched ufo sightings for months afterwards and was relieved? to see some photos of similar sightings from around the world.  i especially was looking for a report of sightings  anywhere near that same area.  i found only one report of a night time sighting of some lights, which  did not sound particularly unusual by the description.  i actually made a report to another ufo group a few months afterwards. 'don't recall their name.  i later actually created my own video simulation in a computer software, just to have my own record of the image and i guess trying to relive the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":64262,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.3077678,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03282015-0046","longitude":-85.60494539999999,"occurred":1284240600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1427606776000,"summary":"Witnessed a white pod-shaped craft speeding silently  in a s to n direction.   low altitude, very fast.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"35973","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1659,"locationName":"Gaylesville, Alabama","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:47684"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Hartford City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at work at the time of the sighting, on a smoke break, the event was also witnessed by my foreman. the moon was visible during the day, i looked up at the moon and noticed two small orbs circling erratically, and then noticed four in the same general area. i pointed out the orbs to my foreman, after a few seconds he finally saw the objects. all were circling wildly and appeared white and metallic as they caught the sun's rays. i said \"what the hell are those?\", after a minute or two he replied \"they're birds.\" my reply to that was \"no way\", i estimate the altitude at 30,000 to 35,000 feet high i said \"those aren't birds that high\", he said \"they are high i'll give you that.\" i returned to the mill to get another witness and when we returned the objects were gone. but in their place was a large, grey, oblong shaped object. the second witness said do you mean that jet, i said that's no jet and looked at the second witness, when we looked back it was gone, there was no condensation trail in the sky from a jet i said explain that, he replied i don't know what it was.

was the right alignment.  his friend owns a christmas tree farm so it was prime opportunity with no city lights. we were in the back yard about 40 feet from a barn that was roughly 40 feet tall . looking straight up with his telescope taking turns . about 100 feet in front of us were hundreds of pine trees . we were taking turns sitting one the picnic table listening to the owner of the telescope talk astronomy,  waiting for our next chance to see the planet. i myself asked what the star was on the horizon over the trees (i think it became brighter and actually caught my attention). then as they switched and his friend adjusted i noticed the light was slowly moving to the right. \r\n        his friend's brilliant analysis was it was a plane coming directly at us and it just looks like it was moving slowly and hovering. great hes a smart guy, but i didn't take my eyes off of it. as i was in mid sentence telling them to look it was no longer on the horizon it was right over the trees 100feet away from us moving about 5 miles an hour straight for the barn. it crossed the yard and went feet above the barn and continued by the house and out towards the road. while this was all happening they were both asking what it was as i was for whatever reason was going side by side with it saying i was leaving.  the illumination was baffling it was so bright it was hard to look at but it didn't illuminate anything at all except itself.  it didn't shine on the barn or the house, us , the trees. nothing. \r\n     the other mind boggling thing was how it got to us i didn't take my eyes off of it. neither did my friend and it did not accelerate there were no tracers it didn't just get bigger . it was absolutely baffling . right after the object left sight we left. my friend and i said we don't really remember saying goodbye to his friend, and we didn't even talk about it on the ride home. the next day we talked about it for hours. we were asking what time it was and what time we left and neither one of us could really even remember. we asked each other seriously did we get abducted but we don't know. the appearance of the object over the resection the horizon and the illumination was a little unnerving.

towards my position. i had my phone with me but saw how it would be gone before i could take a picture. i thought about pulling over and watching it but decided against it for safety reasons. \r\n at the highest altitude i saw it before leaving my sight the object looked blue on top half and white on bottom half. the bluish light appeared to coming from within the object and the white half was more like an aura that went outside of the sphere outline. i noticed a plane's lights blinking farther away (probably landing at the airport in lincoln calif.)\r\n i've seen large balloons rise in the sky but not as quickly as this. it appeared to be intelligently controlled. it was definitely not a rc toy that i have seen at night flying by i-5 where i live.\r\n i used to get real excited by

after a couple minutes of looking to the stars,  i see 3 red lights.  while they looked solid,  they appeared as if looking through a stained glass window(blurry almost).  the lights were in triangle formation,  moving south at a fast speed. the object was moving fast enough that i was sure i would hear a noise,  typical of any known aircraft,  but no noise came.  there did not appear to be a body to the craft,  though common sense tells me there should have been one.  i could only assume it may have been cloaked in some way,  but that is only speculation.  there are no roads behind my apartment,  nor any other buildings close enough to cause any reflections.  there were no clouds in the sky at all,  nor any fog.  i have been a believer in the unknown and/or unexplained,  but i know to reason things out before coming to any conclusions or judgements.  the object and lights moved too quickly for me to take any photos,  and i do not care if anyone thinks i am crazy.  i saw what i saw.  i hope this little bit of information helps towards a full disclosure some day.","distance":"101-500
