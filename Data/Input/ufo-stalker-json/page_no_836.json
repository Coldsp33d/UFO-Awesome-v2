service, my sister and i were heading home. i glanced at the sky from my car window and saw a shape with flashing lights. it didn't look like a plane or a blimp (blimps were fairly common sights at that time for advertising). i stopped the car and watched, trying to figure out what it was.  my sister wanted to know why i had stopped.  as i watched, i noticed the general shape- a round to oval shaped object with a central band of lights around the middle, almost like windows.  each \"window\" lit up in sequence with a pause as the the sequence must have continued around the back side of the object. the sequence went from my left to right.  the window flashes were not uniform in color.  they ranged from blue to yellow to orange.  suddenly it darted to the right, changed direction and traveled up, and then came back to almost the original location.  i was stunned and told my sister that i thought we were seeing at a ufo.  i pulled into a driveway and watched through the front windshield as the object continued to dart and hover.  it then traveled straight out and away from us, getting smaller.  it stopped, darted right, came back toward us becoming larger.  it hovered, moved right, came toward us more, becoming larger.  i backed the car out and headed to my friend's house.  i wanted her and her dad to see it, too.  i told my sister to watch it and it started to travel away from us.  by the time we got to my friend's house, it was very small, like a star, and getting fainter all the time.  it just disappeared.  my sister, who is 3 years younger, never really looked at it, and has no recollection of this event today.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then

at the sky above the treeling in my yard and i saw what i initially thought to be three geese flying above the tree top in my back yard but it quickly became apparent these were not birds. there were three boomerang shaped objects flying in a close formation in a steady direction across the sky. the objects gave off no sound whatsoever. they appeared to be grey in the night sky. it is difficult to say if they gave off their own illumination or i was able to see them because of the natural moonlight and/or city lights projecting upward. it was as if they were a light greyish color in a dark night sky. they did block out the sky in the space they occupied. there were no lights on the objects. this was not a sighting of \"lights in the sky.\" what i saw were three distinct crafts. my sighting lasted about 30 seconds, probably a bit less as it did not take long for these objects to move far enough away that they could no longer be visible from my vantage point. when i realized that these were not birds i called for my daughter to come look but by the time she arrived the objects were in the distance so it was difficult to point them out. they quickly were out of viewing range. i wish i had called out earlier because i do not want to be the only one who saw this as i'm certain no one would believe me. but i know what i saw and these were solid objects. not planes, helicopters

\r\n\r\nthe first night i didn't think much of it, as i thought i had just had one of those 'you dream you are awake, but you're not'-dreams. but then i heard it more often. it really freaked me out as i lived on my own at the time and i really started to doubt my own sanity as far as that i really started to think it might be ufos, because i could only hear the tones, but no 'air plane engine' sound to go with it. \r\n\r\ni told my boyfriend (now husband) about it, and when he spend the night we agreed i would wake him up if i heard it again. i am sure he thought that when he heard it he would be able to reassure me easily and explain what it was... but, when i did wake him up, even he seemed a bit freaked, although i could tell he was trying not to let on. so... we got up and got dressed and went outside to see where it was coming from (i hadn't had the courage to do anything more than look out of my bedroom window before). we walked around for quite some time, and both agreed the sound was coming from the sky, but he also couldn't hear engine noises... the noise went away almost as soon as we started walking around outside (which was odd as it normally lasted much longer on other nights, so i was a bit disappointed as it kept us from finding where the sound came from) after about 10-15 minutes we decided to go back home and to bed. \r\n\r\nit crossed my mind that one of my neighbours could be pranking... but realistically the sounds were too loud and clear (i.E. not muffled by walls, unless they had a huge open window or where outside themselves) for it, and my partner also agreed the sounds seemed to be coming from the sky rather than a nearby building. \r\n\r\nthe airbase i lived close to is volkel airbase. this is a dutch airbase, but it has americans stationed there to look after the nukes. (this is not publicly admitted to by the government but common knowledge among locals and former dutch prime minister ruud lubbers recently publicly admitted to this - possibly by accident).\r\n\r\ni also know they have/had awacs there. so in the end we decided that it must have been the awacs radar making the sound when it's flying at night. \r\n(don't know how it can 'hover' over the same 2-block area that long though) \r\n\r\nstill, after all this time i am not 100% convinced this is true though. is it? does an awacs make 'close encounter' tone noises when engaging it's radar at night? or maybe even another 'silent' military airplane we haven't heard about yet? \r\n\r\nbtw, i do know what an owl sounds like, and a fox or whatever... but this was definitely not an 'natural' sound. if you would have said my neighbour was playing his keyboard very loudly in the middle of night you would be closer... (but not quite). \r\n\r\nyou might also want to know that there were no high rise buildings for miles, but there are some electricity pylons only about 500 yards away...\r\n\r\nall this happened at the end of 2001/beginning of 2002 (i heard it on at least 3 separate occasions, probably more but i know it was at least twice before i mentioned it to my boyfriend.) i have been trying to find out what it was off and on ever since.  since 2010-11 more weird sounds seem to have been heard by people around the world, but going through the videos on youtube, none of them really seem to hit the mark, as most of those seem to be a hum or metallic sound.\r\n\r\ni thought that if it was military experimental planes i would have heard about it by now, but... nothing so far. but maybe you might know something that the general public don't know yet. if so, i'd love to hear your take on this.\r\n\r\nthanks very much in advance,\r\n\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":64213,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.697941389845845,"location":null,"logNumber":"NL-03272015-0013","longitude":5.655579257473335,"occurred":1007807400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Noord-Brabant","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,  A","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1427500287000,"summary":"Tones heard, not unlike the communication tones in 'close encounters' (but not quite).","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/Amsterdam","timeZoneName":"Europe/Amsterdam","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"5403","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4857,"locationName":"Uden, Noord-Brabant","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:48340"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Aiken","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Simple \r\ni need to email someone about what we seen over srs (savannah river site) \r\n\r\ni work for doe \r\n\r\nthis thing has been driving me crazy for many years \r\npeople need to know what we seen over our nuclear sites \r\n\r\ni must remain hidden for we was told to never speak about what happen over srs and them reactors \r\n\r\n\r\nnot only srs about 5 years later they where more ufos \r\naround the chemical plants in north augusta and they where about 5 people who seen this ufo for days and being chase by black jets that the government uses to fly over \r\n\r\ni've said to much on this \r\n\r\nplease email and i will explain it all \r\n\r\ni don't want to leave this world without telling someone who can help \r\n\r\n\r\nsorry if they are type ooos in a hurry \r\n\r\nplease help!!","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":64212,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.5628168,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03272015-0012","longitude":-81.7121333,"occurred":728726400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"South Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1427499238000,"summary":"Over reactors at srs ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"29801","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8087,"locationName":"Aiken, South Carolina","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:48341"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Northcliff Sub Division","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving north east on frontage road i-35 hubururtus road north cliff entrance i observed a falling trail of lights descending like classic burn trail of meteirr vertically to field near cell phone tower vicinity of old nacodoches road.  appeared to be burned out clearly falling near vertical.
