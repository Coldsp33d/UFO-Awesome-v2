time the aircraft in the night sky. some of our group were former military and paratrooper trained smoke jumpers, and were pretty familiar with craft in the sky, at that time.\r\n\r\non the night in question, we saw a red orb streaking across the sky coming at the same path as the satellites. as it passed over the tree, everyone began clamoring that it was 'theirs' and it looked like a sure winner. we had been timing all the satellites from the tree on the eastern side (about 25-30 degrees from the eastern horizon) to the edge of the western horizon (at 180 degrees), clocking about 27 to 32 seconds to do the route. they would be abreast of us in about 15 seconds from leaving the tree to being right in front of us. this red orb made it in about 6 seconds. as it came abreast of us, it stopped dead and hovered. we didn't know if it was reacting to our presence, as we were at the top of the hill with a couple large pickups / crew cabs, in a clearing with a clean line of site in 220 degrees sweep around us. it was a completely clear sky, with no cloud cover at all. \r\n\r\nas our timing took this object past the 30 second mark, (since it was standing still), it was the clear loser of the race. those who had claimed it were moaning about losing, and being ribbed by the others. then, doug noticed that fighter jets were scrambling from whidbey navel air station. if we were located in the middle of an invisible sphere around us, and 90 degrees was above us, we were looking due north at the object (which could have been over canada.) as it was approximately 110 degrees (relative to our position) due north. the fighter jets appeared to be below us and to the left. (if level with us was 180 degrees (relative), the fighter jets were 200 to 200 degrees downwards, and to the left, or westward of us. mostly around the navel air station.)\r\n\r\nthe jets came up one right after the other, as fast as they could (probably about 5-7 seconds apart.) we don't know how many actually made it up before we noticed them, as we were transfixed, staring at the orb.\r\n\r\nwe counted 6 fighters coming up, and they fanned out from sumas, wa to over the ocean. at this time the orb waited, fighters came towards us but did not make it (to be under the orb). once the jets were in the sky, we noticed that the orb had slightly moved east, (reversed course, slightly backward), and was moving rapidly into outer space, for it appeared dimmer. the fighter jets were moving really slowly in comparison. the jets did not at all gain the altitude of the other orb, which appeared to be under intelligent control, and was not a ball of gas or electrical phenomenon or extrusion from a cloud/lightening (no clouds).\r\n\r\nafter a while, the jets started doing a grid pattern, going up to the canadian border, which was less than 10 miles directly in front of us, and then turning around to continue a grid pattern. we were up so high on the mountain, our heads were looking nearly straight up at the orb, and downward towards the fighter jets. it seemed like the jets were flying below us, and mostly staying around the base. at about a half hour after coming up, the jets started landing back at base. we counted around 7 going down, with the final one landing about 45 minutes to an hour, after it had come up. \r\n\r\nuntil the jets scrambled, we thought we were looking at experimental military craft. it was obviously not a satellite, since it was faster, different color, and stopped absolutely from high speed to total stillness, without moving. there was no wobbliness, as would be expected from a helicopter, with which the smoke jumpers were familiar. also, the red light was stationary at a magnitude higher than the fighter jets, since it was so small in comparison to the jets, which were appearing as moving in a straight line and whitish in color.\r\n\r\nin 1977 the animal mutilations were much in the news, and a few abductions were starting to be discussed in the media, so some of the questions we were asking ourselves were \"why were the jets apparently looking for this craft? why did it stop in front of us? did we have any missing time?\"\r\n\r\nsince we were home before midnight, we did not have any missing time. the next day, our squad leader said, \"are we going to talk about this?\" and we replied, \"well, we thought it was a satellite until it stopped. and then us military experimental craft, until the jets came. then it went out to outer space. so, i guess it is unidentified flying object. what's more to say?\" we didn't go out to do satellite races any more, and a few weeks later our contracts as firefighters came to an end.\r\n\r\ni haven't stated this publically until now, but i thought it was time to get it down, before i die or forget. i have not seen this recorded anywhere else, so i wanted to put another piece of the puzzle down, in case this all ties together with other sightings somehow.\r\n\r\nthe 8 of us were stationed at mount baker ranger district, us forest service, and lived in glacier, wa.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":64206,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.9242888,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03272015-0006","longitude":-122.077093,"occurred":239434200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1427477583000,"summary":"Red orb, crossed canada quickly. us fighter jets scrambled to intercept.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13750,"locationName":"Maple Falls, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:48378"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Riverton","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Heading towards home i noticed a vary bright star in the north at first i thought it was just a star. it was just hanging there  then it started moving up and into the clouds. i also then thought maybe a plane with its landing lights still on its not far from the airport. but it poped out of the clouds and blinked out gone like it disappearded. i was floored now just looking to see if it was or will be reported or if anyone else see it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":64205,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.8467064,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03272015-0005","longitude":-89.5369717,"occurred":1427462400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1427471589000,"summary":"Thought it was a star then it went up and into clouds poped out then blinked and disappeard","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"62561","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Riverton, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:48379"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Umatilla","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Me and my family were standing in a field at juniper springs recreation area,which is located in ocala national forest, looking at the stars.  i then told my dad i think i see a satellite and showed him.  he was then like that is not a satellite i think it is a helicopter.  it had red and orange blinking lights.  we started to look at the stars again and the object was not moving at all except for barely moving left and right.  there were at least five helicopters flying around the sky around the area.  a helicopter started for the object and then the object hauled itself out of there and went below the trees.  the helicopter passed over it and then it resumed its original position hovering and barely moving left and right.

was in the house when i had the urge to look outside and i saw two red flashing lights and a vague outline of a craft. i grabbed my girlfriends ipad2 and began to film it. at first it was virtually soundless, i filmed for almost a minute and it wasn't flashing red anymore, it actually had a bright white light and seemed to flash a yellowish/red light (must see video), and then disappear or shut off. i waited about 20 seconds for it to reappear, and then shut off the camera, and thought i hope it comes back. about 30 seconds later i saw it again about 50 feet from where it shut off, at this point it started to come towards the neighbors house and kind of sat there for a few seconds above their house and watched me with just the white light on, bright like the moon. at this point at around 15 seconds of the august 2014 2 video you can see the  object defy regular flying capabilities, almost like a pendulum swinging it defies gravity (seemed like anti gravity). it hovered above the neighbors house for 30 seconds or so and then over my girlfriends house and eventually over my head. i tried to flash the back house light at it, and when i did the loud noise started, it sounded like humming, a sewing machine and then a helicopter and finally a jet from the distance. the strange thing is up until now at only 25 feet away at the most (probably less) there had been no sound. so after i flashed the lights at the craft, the red flashing lights started again, this time with the white light on too, it hung over my head about 25 feet up for about 10 seconds and then slowly went to the left of me and over the garage. at this point it really started moving weird and erratic as the video shows. it also sequentially flashed the red lights back and forth for about 30 seconds or so, i felt it was communicating with me. anyway it was one of the weirdest encounter's i have had, besides the entity and landed craft visual my girlfriend and i witnessed at a lake in sudbury ontario in augast 2012 (also submitted to mufon). i felt i lost at least an hour of time, as it was about 1 a.M. when i went outside and it was 2:40 a.M. when i came back in. must watch video closely at 53 seconds as it is over my head you hear a loud noise, almost unexplainable and the camera shakes and and i say ugh, which was strange cause i don't remember that part at all. i feel something else happened but i only have the video evidence and my memory to go by. please watch carefully and if you slow down the video or zoom in, you can make out the craft's shape. i thought it was disc shaped but it may have been more sphere like. also if you watch closely near the middle of the video, you can see the lights seem to move and change color from the same bulb or light, very strange indeed. attached is the second video i took and a close up zoomed picture cropped from the video, will save the first video for proof, as i don't want to use too much of your storage, the second video is the best one.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then
