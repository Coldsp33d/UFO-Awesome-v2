area with a few homes on the further hilltop. it is a rural area and the hillsides are covered with oak and scrub oak and the like.\r\nthere is a row of power line towers that cross the canyon and make their way up the hillside on the other side.  i woke up randomly near 5 am.  i went out on my patio for some reason, and i saw a strange brilliant blue light across the canyon area.  i went outside and over to the fence to get a better look.  i saw a light sphere or orb that was bright blue and from it it was emitting what looked like a laser or plasma dome over itself.  i say lasers because it looked like lasers shooting out from the center sphere with the effect being the look of a half circle with the flat part on the underneath near the ground.  the blue lights would fade to almost undetectable to bright blue and pulsating.  it at one point dropped a white orb or sphere.  this light would travel eastward from the blue light.  it traveled slowly and sort of milled around different areas before returning to the blue orb.  while the white orb was away from the blue one, the blue one would fade out almost entirely.  upon the return of the white one, the blue one became exceptionally bright.  the blue one was also not stationary.  it would follow the ground and raise up off the ground as well.  even though it was a dark evening, it wasn't so dark that i couldn't make out the tree line or the power line towers.  the blue one remained in the area of a tower that is different than the others.  it is more rectangular and different in purpose perhaps.  i will hike over and see what there is to see.  the blue orb would move a little back and forth east and south/west as well as up and down the hillside.  it would not venture out like the white one.  the white one would go out mill around and return.  it did this numerous times.  each time it met up again with the blue one, the blue one would get very bright.  i watched them for approx 25 minutes until the white one returned to the blue one and seemed like it went inside the blue one which then faded out and was gone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

\t\r\nflying wing mirage... or yb-49 in 'silent' flight over?\r\n\r\ni first though i saw the faint silhouette of a large night owl seen through the branches of a tree, but when i followed it in the dark as it cleared the tree, i thought i was seeing a mirage of a large flying wing silently gliding through the night sky. it traveled northwest to southeast over what from its point of reference would have been over the coast of orange county in southern california. but i couldn't be sure, because it had no engine noise, no flashing lights, no lights at all except for the eerie glow from beneath, more like a reflection of city lights, as it quickly disappeared into the night sky. it did seem to glow of its own light, very faint, like a low amber light with no running lights at all, and no sound. it was fast too. \r\n\r\ni immediately dismissed it, thinking i was seeing things, or some sort of ufo, when over these past days a strange idea kept insinuating itself to me. the image of a flying wing in the night sky was not a ufo but a test plane reincarnated from the old yb-49 era, with a new engine aboard, one silent that gives off a faint glow. it moved quickly enough to make me think it was a jet, but no sound at all. what was it, this flying wing 'mirage', my mind kept asking subconsciously? \r\n\r\nhowever, as this flying wing concept was inherently unstable, why would anyone be bringing it back now, except on an experimental basis? and that's what my mind read, that this above silent, lightless plane was an experimental run of a new kind of engine based on a whole new kind of physics. i imagined, more like a mirage, that aboard was a spherical vacuum container within which was high spinning hot gas plasma, so its self gravitating spin was generating a radiating axial light energy, which covered the whole plane with a faint eery light. but more importantly, it boosted the vessel's lift by lowering its 'inertial mass' (lower g aboard), so it took very little to maneuver the craft with silent engines and great stability. the axial jets of energy were covering the whole body of the craft, which is what gave its eerie light. this would be new physics, and it would be revolutionary to say the least. but i am only reading my imagination and have no way to confirm any of this, except as an apparition or mirage of what i saw. it definitely was not a b-2, which i had seen in night flight over oklahoma. so what was it? \r\n\r\ncould our air force be testing an experimental plane over the southern california coast, flying it from edwards base? the base was named after a pilot who died in the second test of yb-49, so why not? but it must be 'above top secret' if so, and we may never know until a fleet is produced in some future. for now, i will treat it as another ufo. if its our own, we will learn it by and by. but why test it here, with no running lights? unless... it was to give the city lights a show? \r\n","distance":"101-500

witnessed 2 ufos, my mother would take us out every time she got paid, so although im not sure of the particular date or year, i can narrow it down to a friday, and most likely between 2001/02/03, which really isn't bad because the scene was something im sure someone else witnessed. so this day, after 3:30pm school was let out, my mother already cashed her check, and my 2 brothers, mother and myself were en route to go out to eat. while we were driving by one of the airports, i was in the backseat, behind my older brother when maybe 40 miles to my right, high in the sky, were 2 stationary grey spheres. not exactly sure what they were i asked everyone \"what are those\", when suddenly both objects started to zigzag in the sky, going miles apart then stopping suddenly, returning, literally going all over the sky, then stopping, no particular flight pattern just random crazy zig zags, then sudden stops. we kept driving, and i eventually lost sight of them. my mother witnessed them also but my 2 brothers couldn't see them although they were trying to, that's literally how fast they were traveling, then making sudden stops. when i ask my mother does she remember she plays it weak and says \"yeah we saw something\" which is kind of annoying because i know for a fact that she remembers more, she lives in \"reality\". i was horrified of the dark as a child, and i do remember(imagined) a couple nights being extremely scared that i would have an circular vehicle with about 20 small led that shined bright like headlights and were in a circular formation on the front of the craft outlining a window would use powers to abduct me through the window(lol) and i slept in my parents room for a bit, although i will admit im not sure if that was directly connected to that particular sighting or not. we lived in a lower income neighborhood, so witnessing ufos at that time when you're hearing gunshots nightly probably wasn't seen as a priority also is why im not exactly sure of the date this occurred, nor why none of us thought to document it, we had different issues daily. i recently found myself and grew back fascinated with the universe, so that's why im now documenting this. ive realized how important that sighting was and the magnitude of what i saw.","distance":"Over One

so perhaps this sighting could have been attributed to the drugs however it did seem very real to me at the time and i wasn't the only witness...  i saw a very slow moving fighter jet like object it had wings but they wouldn't be very aero dynamic as the craft was like a cross shape and the wings had a downward portion on their tip the craft was definately a one or two seater aircraft and it moved so slow and made not even a modicum of noise.. it had lights on the leading edge of the wings that flashed out a beam of white light... this was my first ufo experience and happened well before i was visited by the gray aliens.. there isn't much more i can say about the sighting really so i will leave it at that\r\n\r\nthanks martin","distance":"21-100

out the door... a friend of mine had started a fire in a field once and it made a circle in the ground so we called this field the ufo field and i walked towards there however before i reached the 'ufo' field i stood in the car park where the guys play cricket next to the pavilion and i saw a ball of lights in the sky...  the lights on this ball were an orangy red in colour and there seemed to be two configurations in the pattern of lights on the ball and they flashed in sequence about 10 lights flashed on and then another 10 flashed on.  i watched in amazement for a good few minutes and then something fantastic happened that is kind of unbelievable a beam of blue light came out of the craft at about a thirty degree angle downwards and the beam stopped and the end of the beam opened out into kind of an oblique square almost as if it was projected onto a cloud but it wasn't... i didn't feel scared because i have been visited by gray aliens for a number of years however i was totally blown away how the beam of light seemed to stop almost like it was made of some hard substance... i have seen four or five ufos in all my years and this is one of my stranger experiences..

100 feet away.  i heard no sound and thought at first it was a satalite or just a star.  i was talking to the object and as i watched someone walked down the street on my side of the road.  the object descended below the house until the person had passed by and then returned to its original position about a metre above the house and behind it.  i immediately ran upstairs and returned with a large knife and i held the knife in my hands with my hands outstretched in front of me. i layed the knife on the ground in a gesture of peace as if i was laying down arms.  i have been visited by gray aliens for much of my life and it is always a thrill to see a ufo in the flesh.  i have seen about four ufo's and also voices in my head once told me to go outside if i wanted to see something and i walked up the street and saw a shooting star that they had probably been tracking.  anyway back to the story... i stood outside my house for about five minutes more and the ufo finally rose up into the sky and disappeared... i really think these type of aliens are here to help us on earth... i think they despise the use of nuclear bombs and they cannot stay on the surface of this planet long because of fungi and bacteria... they are making some of their children into humanoids very much like us however they want their children to lay eggs... i once had an experience of how male grays look after their eggs the female has a vagina where our belly button is and the males suck the eggs out of this hole and clean them in their mouths before returning them to the vagina i am unsure if the eggs are fertilised in this way or if they are merely maintaining the health of the infant grays...  once i was taken to a base where i met some of their human like females and was encouraged to have sex with them.. i had three girls sit on me and they expect you to come immediately so i was unable to come with the first two girls and cried for the third girl to stay on me longer they were really stunning girls in their looks and they had strange vaginas in that they were bigger in girth than our women and the inside of their holes were covered in spikey protuberances as if to give the man grip when he enters them... i was just able to come inside the third girl but i did notice that the girls seemed to lack self esteem despite being absolutely amazing to look at... i felt they thought they were not good enough when i didn't come immediately... i think their vaginas were this size so they can push out eggs with babys inside...I guess you would know their babys because they would not have belly buttons when they break from the eggshell... i have also noticed that they don't like how we eat eggs perhaps because they are scared that they may be used like chickens..  i know this would not happen and i hope you agree with me...\r\nthank-you for listening... martin\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

started getting better pics of them, turned out to be tubes that end on a dime, distinctly, as if they have gone into a wall that i am unable to see. also, every single pic i take outside has a big blue beam going right down the center. last week i took a close-up pic of the screen on my porch, where one of the \"eyes\" always appears, and in the pic you can see a tiny orange dot, and a wire going in and out, so i know this is at least part fraud, but very much not a nickel-and-dime operation. the light and the wire are almost impossibly tiny. there have been military helicopters flying over my house. one night about a month ago i took a night walk in my neighborhood and saw a man, who was about 95% invisible. it was exactly like one you tube video i saw; a us soldier running back into the tank, and he was wearing something that made him almost invisible. i have reached out for help from many many people and organizations and have not gotten a single email back, out of maybe 20. as an expiriment i posted an ad on craigs list, titled project blue beam, and wrote all about it and said email me for pics. zero responses. every time i try to call mufon or other orgs i get a

here; lots and lots of demonic imagery. i am desperate for help. please call me. i know many of my emails are not getting through, and i don't expect this to either, so the phone is the best bet
