observed low in the woods and moving through the woods and several hundred feet in the sky. at times we would see just one or two and other times 20 - 30 of them. some of the video i obtained over the years is similar to this current event and some different, some video and stories of events that took place are hard for people to believe. the orbs at times appear to be right there and then seem to disappear and other times seem to be transparent. we also have obtained video of a craft objecting the orbs late evening and very early in the morning.\r\n\r\nthis event took place just recently and we were seeing the strange bright orbs on several different evenings and at different times. the few days surrounding march 17, 2015 video was obtained of the orbs. on one evening as i walked from one area of the house into the kitchen and out the sliding glass door i could see a bright light descending over a large track of wooded land behind the house. video was obtained of one of the light hovering over the trees. i have seen this orb hundreds of times over the past couple years. the video tells a good story on what they look like in the day light and evening.\r\n\r\nif you find the

augast of 2014 at around 1 a.M. i had the urge to look outside, where i saw 2 red flashing lights above the backyard. i grabbed my girlfriends ipad2, and began to film it. when i started to filmed it as it hovered above the yard, it looked like a star or full moon. as i filmed it, the object changed colors and looked then appeared to shut off and then disappear(see attached media). i said to myself i hope it comes back so i can get a better shot of it. i shut off the camera and about 30 seconds later, it reappeared about 50 feet to the right of where it shut off. i then turned the camera back on and this ufo started to stalk me, it's almost scary to be honest (must see attached videos). i did swear at it once, as i was nervous as it watched me and then hovered over my head ascending and descending 20 and 30 feet above me. the object remained quiet until i flashed the back house light at it numerous times. it than started to hum and became louder like a sewing machine, than  helicopter and finally a jet as it slowly left my view. the strange part is i filmed the first clip with it having no sound, and some of the second with no sound. as i said the sound started after i flashed my light at it. if you watch closely, you can really see the craft make very unusual flight patterns above the neighbor's house and myself. also after i flashed the light at the ufo, it started to blink the red lights again, as it did when i first saw it above the back yard. i felt as though it was trying to communicate back to me. please excuse my comments as i was very excited, to say the least almost prepared for a face to face encounter. this is not my first sighting. of a strange craft and there have been more to follow, i will submit the other sighting/video i captured at another time. the craft looked like a big black ball or sphere about 10 feet or so feet around give or take a few feet. i will attach a photo of the video that i cropped out and zoomed as well, which kind of shows it's true shape.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

would go away and re appear several times.I immediately started looking to the sky and saw nothing,five minutes passed quizzing him asking him to tell me everything, as my wife steps outside and told them jokingly \"please don't get him started\". you see i have always been interested in ufo's,space,our planet's history, etc. and i've always wanted to see something i couldn't explain as far as this subject goes, but never did. \r\n\r\n we unloaded the tank and equipment and brought it inside, still asking him about what all he saw. the conversation continued and we were inside about 10 minutes before they were about to head out. as we stepped outside, we walked to my driveway and we're saying our goodbyes as i was still intrigued of his sighting we gave a look to the sky, i first, and the pair of them almost immediately after and there it was. a very large, dark,  craft, boomerang in shape but with sharp edge's. 5 large, dimly glowing yellowish lights underneath the craft with the middle one where the front would be and 2 on the sides, but all underneath. i could not believe what i was looking at and began to hit the arm of my friend as to get his attention to look up but they were both already staring at it as well. it made no sound, and the best description of the  way it looked against the night sky was like how in the movie predator, when he(the predator) would be cloaked in the trees, you really wouldn't be able to see him except if he moved, well that's how this craft looked against the night sky. you could see the edges, but only because it was moving, and slowly at that.As for the lights, they were glowing with a slight pulse, bright but very faint at the same time, but large. it traveled slowly in plain sight and as weird as it sounds, just disappeared. totally where it should have still been visible, but just wasn't. this whole ordeal lasted only 20 seconds or so but made a very big impact on me. i wrote the date down onto my desk, even called my friend after we freaked out on what we had just seen and had him tell me exactly what he saw as if i had not been there. just amazing\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
