on the curves of the moon with my 83x retractable zoom. this time the really bright light was bouncing off the surface of it. this made the autofocus on my camera go back and forth, and every time it did this it would create what looked like a shadow on the side of the moon. this made the bright object show every time too. finally i figured out a way to zoom in on the object, and then i snapped these four pictures. \r\n\r\nthe 1st picture shows an orange glow coming from it.\r\n\r\nthe 2nd picture shows what looks like the object changing its shape. \r\n\r\nthe 3rd pictures is the most interesting one because it looks like a reentry capsule with its circular heat shield. some think it might be a lunar probe with the extension on it.\r\n\r\nthe 4th picture looks like it might have some heat coming out of it like the first but not as intense.\r\n\r\nwhy did i only snap 4 pictures? well, because i figured they might be a waste of time, and that i'd probably delete all of them anyway due to the object being nothing at all.\r\n\r\nit wasn't until i put them on my laptop that i said \"wow... what the heck is that?\" now i wish i had snapped more pictures of it, and maybe a short video too, but i will remember to do that the next time... hopefully there will be a next time.\r\n\r\nit now has me hoping to see more of mystery object whenever i zoom in on the moon.\r\n\r\nmaybe someone can clear up the mystery.

caught a glimpse of something very large and very bright in my peripheral vision. it had multiple bight yellow-orange lights, maybe 6 or 8. it was heading in a downward type trajectory and appeared to be at least as big as the biggest jetliners ( 767 etc). it was moving very fast but not so fast it blurred. i’ve never seen any object that large move that fast. my initial instinct was that i was about to witness a jetliner crash within a mile of me and as i stood up in horror to take in the ensuing crash/explosions it disappeared before reaching the ground or cresting the horizon. from the time i caught a glimpse to the time it disappeared was less than 5 seconds. the lights did not fade away, they went off like they were switched off. there was no discernible sound. ( a jet, plane, helicopter, etc would have been audible from the short distance away). it occurred to me,in those brief seconds, that while my instinct told me it was an inevitable commercial airline crash it was not like it was attempting some sort of emergency landing...More like the craft was being intentionally steered downward at a steep angle. the lights were not well defined lights with distinct edges. they had more of a “flamey” nature sort of like an afterburner. after the sighting ended i had this empty, confused, creeped out feeling and felt confident i could not have been the only person who saw this. this was no speck in the sky in the middle of the night. this was in a populous area in the early evening and it wasn’t subtle. it was really quite spectacular. i called the local police dept the next morning to see if they had received reports about this and they said they had not. i’m a reasonably intelligent person not under any drug/alcohol influence and i know what i saw. i feel compelled to find someone else who saw it also. this was in the lake ariana area in auburndale florida (near lakeland and winter haven). florida has a fair share of military bases. i am certain, beyond doubt, i have seen either: a) a secret military aircraft capable of extraordinary speed, cloaking, and who knows what other technologies beyond the scope of comprehension by ordinary citizens. or...B) a bonifide extra-terrestrial craft from outer space. ?? no one could successfully convince me that what i saw could be explained away as anything conventional or normal. the image is burned in my mind and, quite frankly, i wish i had not seen it at all.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":88584,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.0706275,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12062017-0009","longitude":-81.78326059999999,"occurred":1512499500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1512563216000,"summary":"Lit up suddenly on downward trajectory. thought i was witnessing jetliner crash. big, bright, and close. lights disappeared before reaching ground/horizon.","tags":["sound","landing","lights","crash","disc"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1512699647737,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":28,"maxtempi":82,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":22,"meantempi":72,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":62,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":28,"maxtempi":82,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":22,"meantempi":72,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":62,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Auburndale, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7282"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Macomb","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in my living room preparing to head to my friends house across the street to spend the night. my friend was with me in the living room but went outside before me. i heard him frantically calling my name and to \"get my ass out here\". when i left my house he was about 200' away at the entrance to our subdivision. i ran to him. he pointed at the craft and said \"don't ever forget this.\" i immediately knew it was a ufo in the traditional sense. it hovered 30' over a bridge in a field adjacent to our subdivision that was not yet developed. there was a car parked under the vehicle with it's headlights on. the craft had 6 white lights and just hovered there. i cant recall if it spun or not. about 30 seconds after watching the craft hover it descended to the east into more dense forest at a very slow rate of speed. the vehicle then drove away the opposite direction.My friend and i ran to his garage to grab a baseball bat and golf club and into the forest to find it. we found nothing. the next morning we described the event to my friends mother. she accused us of lying. she thought we had read the newspaper from the day prior our sighting which described the craft had been sighted in our county.The descriptions were identical. i have tried to locate the article in the local newspaper (the macomb daily) past issues but they are not available online prior 1994. the event occurred in 1992. i'm hoping that by reporting this maybe the driver of the vehicle or anyone that may have read the article would have more info.

hollesley bay and the former raf woodbridge both my wife and myself observed a pulsating red light hovering about 10ft above a field to the right of the lane. as i drove towards it it started to gain a little bit of height and was moving towards the road at about 90 degrees to my path. as we got closer i opened my cab window to see if i could hear anything. the red light passed over the bus at between 20 and 30ft and was completely silent. i couldn't make out any structure to the light either. bearing in mind that i am an aviation enthusiast and good at aircraft recognition i still don't know what this light was. we also get a lot of british army ah 64s practising around here and definitely wasn't one of them.\r\ni appreciate that i have taken a long time to report this but it is only in recent years i have had access to programmes like ufo files unsealed and it was one of them on the rendlesham incident which wasn't far from my sighting referring to a pulsating red light that maybe i put two and two together. as for the lighthouse at orford ness that has been used to try and debunk the rendlesham incident in my case that was directly behind my bus and to the left of the red light.\r\nchris beard ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line
