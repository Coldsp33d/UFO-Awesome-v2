to the st. lawrence seaway shipping canal.  the day was a high pressure day, no clouds, no aircraft were sighted and the temperature was about 60 degrees f. the sun was at the west horizon, and just barely below it. \r\n\r\ni observed a solid looking reddish-orange sphere flying above and along power lines that lead directly into alcoa.  they originate an the robert moses power dam that lies east northeast of alcoa by about 5 1/2 mile.\r\n\r\ni immediately noticed that the object did not have any lights on it as required for aircraft navigation. upon making this observation and bringing it to my wife's attention i saw the second sphere following the first on the same flight path.\r\n\r\ni was nearing a section of the highway that didn't allow any further observation.   we continued easterly on route 131 for approximately 200 yards when lise and i observed a sphere, i assumed it was the first one, cross route 131 at right angles to the road and at an elevation of approximately 600 feet.  the sphere was larger in diameter due, i assume, to our closer proximity to it. i quickly lost sight of the sphere as trees on the north side of the road blocked our view. \r\n\r\ni had reached the turn to the south for the dennison road and took the turn and stopped. lise and i immediately saw the second sphere leaving the proximity of the power lines at a right angle and it seemed to follow the same northerly flight path of the first sphere.  again, due to trees we lost sight of the object.\r\n\r\ni brought the vehicle back on route 131, traveling east and sped up to allow us a better view to the north.  when we reached an overgrown meadow with shorter trees we saw the first sighted object in a stationary position over the seaway shipping canal.  as the second object neared the position of the first sphere, the hovering sphere moved off to the north very quickly. the flight path was not a perfectly straight line but could be characterized by a slight porpoising and the object quickly became smaller to the point that it could no longer be distinguished.\r\n\r\nthe second sphere,upon reaching the recently vacated position of the first object began hovering, stationary without discernible movement. when the first sighted object was no longer discernible, the second object followed the flight path of the first sighted object until it too was no longer visible.\r\n\r\nduring our observation our conversations were quite simple like \"do you see that?\" i expected that, at any time during our observation, something would happen to explain the event, such as aerial navigation lights would be turned on. sitting along side of route 131, with the objects no longer in sight, i asked my wife \"what did you see?\" as opposed to providing her with my recollections and observations that might taint her viewpoint.  her descriptions were identical to mine.\r\n\r\ni continued easterly on route 131 until the eisenhower shipping canal locks were in view and decided to go to the elevated tourist observation\r\nto determine if the lock workers or the general public had the same observations that we had.  two people were at the elevated observation\r\n location and they stated that they had not seen anything out of the usual.  \r\n\r\nwe wife and i had cell phone cameras but were too mesmerized by what we were seeing to try taking photos.

(this detail will become important later) after walking approximately 10 minutes, we were within a couple of blocks of the friends house i was staying at. as we approached, we noticed a white luminous object that we both first thought was a search helicopter, with a beam shining down to the ground, approximately 3/4 mile away and  to the southeast from where we were walking. we stopped for a moment to take notice as this would not be typical in this rural area, and that we could not hear any noise.\r\n\r\nafter a moment, we both simultaneously noticed that the craft was not traveling on a path parallel to the ground as a helicopter would, but rather on an elliptical path, getting slightly further away and higher, then closer and lower, etc.. we also took notice to the fact that despite its movement and change in position, we could not see any structure of a helicopter or any other type of known to us craft, only the very bright light of the object itself and it's beam. at that close range, a helicopter would have been immediately recognizable, even in darkness, by its sound, and lights. we began to realize that we might not be looking at a helicopter and were rather confused as to what we were seeing. after watching it's \"orbit\" for approximately a minute, the beam, as best i can describe it \"filtered\" up to the craft. a light being switched off would result in the column of light visible being instantly gone, but this light appeared to retract. after the light retracted into the object, it's elliptical orbit stopped and the object itself dimmed considerably, to the point where it was hardly visible. after remaining dark and stationary for approximately 10 seconds, it simultaneously grew in luminosity and apparent size greatly, perhaps 3-4 times, casting light and shadow over a rather large area. it was bright enough that, in the absence of any streetlights, we could momentarily see the yard of the house we were then standing in front of, as if it was early twilight.\r\n\r\nit remained stationary for another 15 or so seconds, at its larger size and brightness, before dimming to it's original level when we first noticed it, turning the beam back on (which appeared to filter down to the ground with a total time of around 1 second) and resuming it's elliptical orbit. we were absolutely frozen at this point, awestruck and terrified at the same time, but unable to really say or do much but watch in awe. as terrified as we were, we felt compelled to stay and watch, rather than run the couple of blocks to his house. i don't know why. it did this cycle a further 2 times before going dim and staying stationary for approximately a minute. all the time, we cannot see any discernible shape, or hear any noise. it resumed it's original brightness, and remained stationary for approximately 30 seconds, before taking off on a flight path that took it directly over our heads approximately 150 feet up, at a speed of around 30-40mph. it appeared to be about 20 feet across. as it passed overhead, we looked up, and could tell there was a solid structure that the light was emanating from, but due to the brightness of the light, it was hard to tell what it was, but appeared to be shiny and metallic, with the light coming from the exterior of the craft itself. in other words, there appeared to be no point light source, but rather, the entire craft glowed uniformly. there were no external features that we could discern. in a moment, it was gone over the trees and out of our view. we were quite shaken up over everything that had just happened, and having this craft fly over our heads only a couple hundred feet up, and basically ran for our lives back to his house. we did not sleep the rest of the night. we tried to rationalize what we saw, but no matter what scenarios we came up with, nothing could explain what we saw. we spent the entire next day together, replaying over and over the previous nights events, questioning whether or not we had even seen what we thought. questioning ourselves and our sanity. \r\n\r\ni said earlier that the tapes we had made the previous night would become important, and here is where. later the next night, we were in his room, still shaken up, but calmed down considerably, and decided to pop in one of the tapes we had made the night before. listen to some music, take our minds off of things and relax. we made two tapes full of music, and neither of them were playable. the contents were distorted and mostly un-listenable, in the exact same way if you were to pass the tapes by a large magnet. the tapes were fine when we left as we listened to a part of one of them before leaving where they were recorded. if there was any doubt that what we saw was real, that doubt was now gone. it was real. that realization was terrifying, and for me, left me with anxiety and a feeling of helplessness for quite a long time. even to this day, when i think about it, i get a chill, and recounting this experience right now, i've got tears forming. it was a very powerful experience for me, and i imagine him as well, though after that weekend, we didn't talk much about it.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

and tripod set up. we noticed a bright chevron shaped object in the sky. it was brighter than any other stars and seemed to be moving slowly from ne to sw. i assumed that it was just an airplane until it changed shape to a u. i took a photo of the object right before it changed shape and then after it changed. then i took photographs of the different sections of the night sky, at about 70-80 degrees to the se, sw, w, nw, and ne. later when i uploaded the photos to my computer started looking through them expecting to see some fuzzy star patterns i found the other dark objects in the sky. some of the shapes were orbs, some had a resemblance to the space shuttle only black or at least not fully lit up, of the other two types one was a squatter angular version of the shuttle and the others were cigar shaped. the shuttles seemed to be in a formation, the cigar shapes and orbs were in looser formations across the sky. we routinely go out and watch the iss pass over head when it is scheduled to pass by at a reasonable hour so we are familiar with what that looks like and it passes much faster than the object was moving that night. i uploaded some of the photos to my facebook page to see if anyone saw what my wife and i did in the photos. i have photographed the same sections of the night sky periodically since that night but have not since captured any unusual objects in the sky. i checked my lens for dust etc to insure that it didn't produce the images but the lens was clean and a picture through a dirty lens would have produced the same object in all sections of the

that the sound was coming from outside. i followed her as she dashed out the front door.\r\n\r\ni could still hear the trademark military jet-type whooshing sound in the distance. it's sort of an irregular pulsating whoosh that starts suddenly and ends as suddenly as it started, and then repeats that maybe five or six times afterwards, the sound fading off.\r\n\r\nso we're standing out front looking at the cloudless sky, and i'm telling her \"you know, sometimes when military jets are sent low over areas they don't usually don't fly over, it means there was a ufo spotted in the area.\"\r\n\r\nand not 30 seconds later, out of my left eye i see a light-orange-yellow spherical-shaped light moving nne to ssw high in the ssw sky moving ssw through the constellation orion. about a second later, as i'm alerting my wife to what i'm seeing, a second light that looked just like the first light appeared about 3\" at arm's length to the west, moving exactly parallel with the first light. a second later, the second light faded out, and the first light continued on with its ssw trajectory a couple more seconds and quickly faded out.\r\n\r\ni've seen probably 100 meteors, including 2 fireballs, 6 or so comets, satellites. and i've seen some unidentified stuff, too. but this was by far my most spectacular and unusual sighting. i'm 58.\r\n\r\nthey moved slower than a

real close.\r\n\r\ni got a real good look at them. they weren't steady, like light bulbs. nor did they strobe. they were distinctly round, but diffuse, and they gave the appearance that they were moving behind a sheet of water, or slightly translucent film with an irregular surface. at the point of fade they were maybe 40% of the diameter of a full moon.\r\n\r\nby far the most unusual

process of making a right hand turn onto dairy farm road, i observed, at a distance, in the sky, an object that i will describe as looking like four shiny black bowling balls, held tightly together by force or design and positioned at an approximate 20 degree slant to the right, hovering motionless in the sky. this particular evening was very different from the normal sunsets i am used to. the sun was setting unusually large and an extreme orange, glowing through an unusual cloud cover resulting in a beautiful sunset. the object startled me at first because it was so unnatural and out of place in the early dusk sky and i wasn't sure if i had actually witnessed it or not. after made my right turn onto dairy farm road i was going to try to find a spot along the road to stop and try to take a photo but i couldn't in a safe manner. periodically i would lose sight of the object in the tree line but it never moved or left. after traveling for aproxmately 4 minutes i arrived at the intersection of dairy farm road and sc59, preparing to cross north onto smith dairy road. i witnessed the black object, still in the sky to my left, now to have changed shape to a silver cylinder. the object remained in a stationary position, occasionally reflecting the soft orange gow of the large setting sun. aproxately 10 minutes later i arrived at the west-oak hs. the object was still in the same position and remained there while i walked my dog and waited for my daughters bus. at around 8:10pm, the sun was almost completely gone in the western sky and the now silver cylindrical object was fading and left behind what appeared to be a soft cloud of the same size and shape which soon dissipated. i would like to add, and it seems to be of importance that during my witnessing this event there was a lot of airplane activity in the sky above and around this object. i observed at least four ionized exhaust lines left by planes traveling horizontal just below this object and approximately four or five more traveling from the sky above the object and down at a very slight angle towards the earth. i apologize for the description i am providing, perhaps i can furnish a drawing of try event if you wish to have it. this whole event, from witnessing the object and jet planes and them watching the object change form and disappear took about 40 minutes.
