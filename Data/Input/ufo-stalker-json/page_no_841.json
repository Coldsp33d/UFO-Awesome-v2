fall or explode and kept becoming brighter. they moved in a triangular formation straight up at first, then across the sky toward me. they made no sound whatsoever and as i watched, the two lights furthest from me flashed and went out but i could still see the first light moving towards me. it was red-orange in colour and very bright. it looked like a ball of fire. as the first one went directly over top of me, i saw one of the two that had gone dark. it was a dull gray and i could barely see it, except that it blocked the stars and reflected the light from the streetlamps slightly. it passed directly over my head as well and it looked like the bottom of a plate from directly underneath it. it was hard to tell how big they really were because i couldn't tell how high they were when they were directly overhead. i did not see the third one pass over. they moved slowly and silently over top of me and then towards the end of my street and over the gorge. my first thought when i saw them was that i should hide, but then i just felt mesmerized and excited, then slightly afraid when they were gone. i lost sight of them when they passed below the tree

and does his business.  after finding an watching three satellites and not finding the fourth i heard and saw one of our uh-60s flying past hershey park on their way back to ft. indiantown gap.  while watching the helicopter and noticing that several other airplanes and commuter jets were in the air on such a clear chilly night; i detected movement out of the corner of my eye.  i turned my head and there was a giant black v flying fat from the se to nw.  it had to my best recall, six red lights that i could see on the lower left wing, one under the nose and one i could make out under the right wing in the further most aft position.  i initially said 'holy ?@#$!'.  then i tried to commit as much detail to memory and take measurements.  with my arm fully extended and the right hand thumb and index finger fully extended than was the size from nose tip to trailing edge of a wing.  it was completely silent.  it travelled a heading of about 320-330 degrees.  it past over and just behind the blackhawk i was watching.  all other air traffic was unaffected.  i waited several minutes after trying to take a picture and no fighter jets were in trail or chasing it.  looking directly at it was harder than using off center viewing which is best for night time.  looking at it directly the red lights were very dim and the craft was shimmery almost like star trek cloaking.  with off center viewing you could see the red lights better and the outline of the craft.  it wasn't like it was flying.  it was like it was sliding on a solid surface.  it was so smooth, fast and silent.  whole exposure time was about 5 seconds.  to the average person that may not sound like much but to a aircrew member 5 seconds can be an eternity when the adrenaline and training kicks in.  i tried to get a picture with my cell phone but once you took your eyes off the craft it was hard to re-acquire the target.  then a tree was in the way and then i snapped a pic in the area it would of been in but it was inside the satellite app of my iphone.  doing my own research it mostly resembled the v from phoenix.  my educated guess on altitude and airspeed would be 5,000 feet  and 1000 mph. with zero sound.  heading 320-330 degrees and size estimate 300-350 feet long nose to tail/end of wing.  24 years military service; still active national guard.  enlisted for 15 years and now a warrant officer since 2006.  i spent my whole career in aviation and most of it flying and crewing ch-47 chinooks.  now a course writer and platform instructor.  i know aviation well and i am trained to react and work under pressure and unusual environments.  after the sighting i finished with the measurements.  looked up pa mufon and sent an email.  their report link is broke so i am submitting it here.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings, Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

1970.  i was ridiculed and asked by the host if i was on pot at the time.  that was the last time i told this event to a large group.\r\n    i was about 15 or 16 years old at the time so my eyes were very good.I became a private pilot a few years later, so i have a scientific interest.  i was standing on the side of our public school waiting for my buddy to finish saying good night to his girlfriend. he was around the corner of the building a few feet away while i waited for him.\r\n    while looking at the starlit sky, i noticed that one of the stars started to move, relative to a telephone pole across the street.  the star like object seemed like it was above the atmosphere.  it moved straight north about 1/2 the distance of the telephone pole and then stopped for a second.  then it moved again about a foot, based on a ruler held at arms length.  then it stopped again.  then it moved northeast about another foot, based on a ruler as a guide.  then it moved to the right about a foot at arms length,before stopping.  then it moved north again so that it was now about 60 degrees from the horizontal.  as it stopped, it began to get dimmer and dimmer.  i could see that this \"star\" was wavering or spinning a little before it finally diminished so that it could no longer be seen. it appeared to leave the area and the sun's reflection seemed to be the source of it's illumination.  i've never seen a satellite move in any direction other than in a straight line.  we didn't have sophisticated satellites back then, as far as i know, that would change direction and leave the earth's area.  i brought this to the attention of my buddy, who was too busy kissing his girlfriend goodnight, but he does recall seeing something like what i described.  to this day, i can not explain what i saw.  if there is a reasonable explanation for this, and you have similar reports, i'd like to know what i saw.  to this day, i'm still mystified.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

usual time during late sunset. as i explained earlier, carl paulson explained to me that after the sun sets the rays that are still shining light up into the sky, light up these crafts and they cannot hide from it.\r\n\r\nso i intentionally walk every day at this time and look to the west to trap \"ufo” potential activity.  3 years ago i caught a plasma powered cigar maneuvering right in front of me in the setting sun. \r\ni reported this to mufon and carl paulson explained its propulsion system and reason for its uncloaking.\r\n\r\nfact: yesterday, march 19, 2015 @ sunset i am reporting two in echelon formation machines traveling from the nw sky toward the se at 20,000’  these “aircraft\" were in routine echelon formation to each other. \r\nthe one on the right was .25 miles forward and .25 miles to the right of the trailing wingman.\r\n\r\nthese machines were traveling at approx twice the normal airliner speed and making the very same small contrail signatures the plasma powered cigar i saw 3 years ago did.  they were clearly over the northern tip of sanibel island and coming over land toward me and in a se direction.\r\n\r\ni immediately surmised they were experimental usaf pilots on a training mission going towards the upper keys. but their speed was incredibly fast for a landing approach.\r\n\r\nhowever, usaf/usn planes do not leave contrails. usaf/usn planes are not allowed to break the sound barrier over land and they were way past that speed. in fact, i waited for the sonic boom after they would've\r\n past my position and heard nothing. \r\n\r\nthey made my \"strange list\" and i stopped in my tracks and studied the sky waiting for them to pass my position.\r\n\r\nfact: these machines did not exhibit any coloration like the orange/yellow plasma colors i have seen on 2 other occasions. the short contrails were white and did appear similar in size and diameter of what i witnessed before on the plasma powered et craft reported previously.\r\n\r\nfact: under tight turns usaf will generate turbulent atmospheric conditions that will appear white.  however, these machines were moving in a straight line and much faster than mach1. \r\n\r\nfact: these machines were silent. however they were not past my position and the sound trails aircraft. so is this fact fuzzy? read on please. \r\n\r\nfact: here’s were it gets more strange, as they crossed over ground or as they approached a purplish/pink cloud they disappeared contrails and all.\r\ni assumed the setting sun’s rays could no longer light them up and waited for them to come closer to me to get a visual. they were no longer visible at all.  wow.\r\nthey were gone. as if the were never there. missing from the sky, no contrails no sound, no physical objects on the trajectory they were traveling in…. nothing. gone\r\n\r\nif: they made a turn at the speed they were traveling at the pilots would’ve died from extreme g forces. also, i would've had a better chance to see them with their wingtips up in the arc of the turn.  \r\n\r\nconclusion: i still remain that these machines were usaf because of the common formation flying position. however, i have a nagging suspicion that 20% of 100% surety that they were extra terrestrial.\r\n                    reason is because they are unknown and i have no data to determine origin one way or the other. i offer a 20% option to et is because of the overwhelming statistical data that does not allow common repeated et sightings. \r\n                    most sightings are misidentified aircraft, usaf/usn alien reproduction vehicles, atmospheric conditions etc leaving very little room for the 5% unknown potential et sightings.\r\n                    question: does the military have sonic boom avoidance technology and cloaking capability for high speed aircraft?  answer: very likely military or black budget capability exists and american citizens are not in the \"need to know\" loop.\r\n\r\n                    i am reluctant to keep reporting these sightings but the number of strange machines in the sky is increasing and undeniable.  i am a sober, military trained observer and do not seek any publicity or adulation for any reason whatsoever. \r\n                    in fact i consider this an intrusion in our airspace and wish i did not see these machines at all. these things are real and seem to operating routinely in our skies. \r\n                    \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

over the cattle field heading at a steady slow pace towards us, just a little to the south of where we were standing. all i could really see against the night sky was two lights that appeared to be attached to something huge. the space between the lights, was at least a football field apart. when it went by the house we never heard a thing and finally it disappeared behind the tree line out of my line of sight. i convinced my self that it was two helicopters flying at the same rate of speed, and the reason they were so quite was government technology and so and so forth. keep in mind i never told anybody about this. almost a year later i did some work on my neighbors car and she started telling me about 6 or maybe more lights she seen moving like they were connected, also quiet.

that night we all saw something pretty incredible. my girlfriends daughter noticed it first and got everyone's attention. my buddy and his girlfriend saw it next. when my girlfriend and i spotted it i started to record it on my iphone. we saw a craft with no clear edges or sides and it seemed to emanate ever changing light from its entirety thereby obscuring it's surface. it appeared to be 20-50 foot in length although its exact distance from me was not easy to judge so i couldn't say to any certainty its size or shape. it appeared to be in our neighborhood and hovering over the rooftops and a height of no more than a few hundred feet. i would say it was about 200-400 feet away from where we were all standing in our back yard. it would hover then move slowly then quickly, alternating between the three. when i say quickly i mean instantaneously. i would estimate that from the time we first saw it until it became stationary it traveled a couple thousand feet. this all took about 30 seconds. it then sat there for about 15 seconds at which point it started pulsing, let out a very soft but weird kind of electrical whine and then flew almost directly away from us towards the southern horizon at extremely high speed, then abruptly made an almost right angle turn to a course of almost straight up and at an unbelievably high rate of speed......All while staying directly in the center of our field of view. during this whole time the object didn't make a sound. not even the sound of air rushing over it as it whipped by us!!! it did let out a strange electrical noise, like it was charging up to take off and that's exactly what it did. 6 of us watched it and i have the whole thing on video. that's another oddity, what we saw with out eyes appeared maybe 30 foot across but it hardly showed up on the video, like it what cloaking itself or messing with the camera. i can't say what it is that i saw with any certainty but, i believe that it was not a plane, helicopter, rocket, jet, ballon, lantern or anything like weather phenomenon. it seemed to move intelligently and as weird as this sounds, it seemed biological in the nature of its movements and lighting.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

light in size but brighter. as i spotted the object, the appendage immediately turned to my direction and the light focused on me. i felt very nervous as if it was watching me. it was definitely not a boat because i had lived in a coastal town for most life and this was not like any boat i had seen before as it hovered above the water, had an arm protruding from it and made no noise at all. at this

blinking seemingly randomly. we thought we could make out a dark mass attached to the lights that made us think it was a helicoptor from the local hospital. the night was quiet and we thought we could make out an engine sound but it was very faint and could have been from something else. we watched these lights move north then arc to the east and out of view.  as the object banked, we were then able to see a single steady green light on the craft. about five minutes later i saw the same craft follow the same northerly path. at the time i dismissed it as special lighting on the emergency

zone that i previously did not know about. ufo's have been known to study earthquake prone areas before & after major events happen. they have been seen around chili subduction zone quakes & around the japan 2011 great quake. due to this experience of the orb, i am having a tendancy in believing the great cascadia quake is close to happening. people are ultimately unaware of this great quake in the pnw & maybe, just maybe because i knew about the information, & because i was new to the area, it, the orb, came to visit me. since the experience i have decided to move away from the quake & tsunami prone areas and continue to have these dreams. i have not seen the orb since moving away from the longest beach in the world.

park.\r\nsix lanes of traffic quite busy i had to pay attention to driving.  i saw ahead to my left in the sky what i assumed was a  commercial plane flying toward the fort myers intnl airport.  but when i seemed to pass it, glancing , i noticed it had a line up of red, green and yellow lights along the full side.  it was not moving as i had to quickly glance back to see it.  when i was finally able to move to a side street, stopping and looking back , it had vanished.\r\nit was  growing dark and the sky was partially cloudy, the vehicle being below the cloudline.  i heard no noise, and when thinking back realized it seemed small for a large jet to be that close.  i repeat, it did not move either as a jet would have been far forward of the traffic and i would not have had to look back to see it. i knew it must be a ufo by the colored lights that ran the full length.\r\nam not good at describing distances and as i was driving did not think of it.\r\ni am a mufon member and am trying to be more careful of such

to start my decent down the highway, i noticed a large, bright, orange, amber, red glowing light. it was shaped like an egg, with the small end at the top and seemed to be the size of a volkswagon beetle. it followed my truck across the top of the hill and dropped down to a lower level and continued to almost track my movement down the road. i continued to watch it closely and pulled to the side of the road shoulder, i had both windows open and i shut off my truck. there was no noise.. i then exited my truck to retrieve a pair of binoculars from my truck tool box. all the while the egg shaped craft was glowing and there was a solid outline of the egg, but the inside was like flowing lava, with a liquid fire like flame or pulsing boiling almost alive movement of what i call lava light. i found my binocs and put was raising to put them to my eyes... and that thing left out of there in a way that still sends chills up my spine... it was like warp speed x 10!! i traveled in a straight line trajectory to the nw. there is nothing on the face of this earth that can move like that! there is not a speed i can even equate to it. and it was intelligent and observing me. it did not want me getting a closer look. i marked the time and returned home and called the local skylark airport and ask if there had been any unusual activity reported at that time and they said no, and nothing on radar in that area. i will say that it has changed my life and my belief system forever.","distance":"101-500
