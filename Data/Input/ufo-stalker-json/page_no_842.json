state street toward eisenhower parkway at roughly 10:25pm eastern, i noticed in my periphery to the west (looking left) a redish-orange circle above the roofs of the houses on the left side of the street just as i was approaching the traffic light at stimson street. at first i thought it might be a helicopter, since there is a good bit of that type of traffic to uofm hospital.\r\n\r\nwhen i made it to the traffic light, it had just turned red, so i rolled my window down and tried to find the object and to listen to see if i could hear the normal loud medical chopper, but could not at that time nor hear anything related.  i turned left onto stimson toward industrial, and as i reached the light at the stimson & industrial intersection, i again spotted the object in the sky clearly beyond, but above the old kroger building, and it was now moving south.\r\n\r\ni turned right onto industrial parkway, heading south toward eisenhower parkway, and continued to track the orb the whole way, again, with no sound from the object.  throughout this time, it was no longer a solid color but more of a plasma-type effect, transitioning from red to orange to yellow to white, and mixing in between.  it's aerial path also seemed to be a bit erratic at this point as it seemed to decend/acend in jagged movements.  at this point i was fumbling trying to get my phone to take a video or pictures, but was unable to do so due to driving in an attempt to stay with the object. \r\n\r\nas we approached woodbury gardens apartments, i lost sight of the orb due to a bit of traffic on the road requiring my attention.  i decided to turn left onto astor avenue heading west to see if i could relocate it.  i drove a short way down astor, until i came to woodbury park.  as i stopped, i spotted the orb to the north, just as it entered into the bottom of a very large, very dark triangle-shaped object that i hadn't seen prior to this. \r\n\r\nthe triangle-shaped object's surface was extremely dark, such that i was able to make out any detail of the surface of it.  there were, however, 3 flashing white lights that followed a repeating sequence in the shape of a triangle.  \r\n\r\nthe lights were moving from the north toward the south, and seemed to be approximately 2-3 miles away.  i shut my car off at this point and exited the vehicle to look and again try to snap a photo or video.  i also noticed there were people walking in the neighborhood and i asked if they had seen the lights, which they hadn't until i pointed them out.\r\n\r\nthe large triangle-shaped object moved smoothly, continuously, with the lights continuing to flash in the same sequence across the sky from north to south at a brisk clip.  unfortunately, it was brisk enough to have moved beyond the large trees in woodbury park and prevent me from getting a photo.  \r\n\r\ni glanced at the clock and it was now just after 10:31pm.  i attempted to drive to the south to see if i could find the large triangle-shaped object again, but was unsuccessful.  i stopped to jot down a quick drawing of a map of both object sightings and of the objects, and to give mufon a call at that time.  after returning home i checked playback of flight radar data for the time in question and no flights where in the vicinity at the time either.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

apartment is on the third floor of a building with a large sliding-glass window leading to a balcony. my boyfriend noticed some strange-looking lights outside. i thought it was maybe a plane and wouldn't have given it a second thought. however, he went up to look and started exclaiming that what he was looking at was not a plane. i looked, and it appeared to be a disc-shaped craft with mostly white lights possibly hovering then traveling slowly and we lost view behind an apartment building. i got the impression that the disc was not spinning, but i don't know for sure.\r\n\r\nwe stepped outside on the balcony and my boyfriend pointed out a strange triangular craft with a red, green, and white light blinking at each point it flew overhead slow enough that we were able to observe it. then he noticed another, and another. they were flying in different directions across the sky and would eventually fly so far away we would be unable to see them.\r\n\r\nduring the sighting, i was in a state of disbelief. i was focused on trying to get a video, and my boyfriend was yelling that what we were seeing were ufos. i tried to be skeptical, and thought of what they could possibly be. i have seen satellites before, and these were too close to be satellites, plus they did not look like any satellites i had ever seen. they were not planes, as they were completely silent and flew in all different directions across the sky.\r\n\r\nmy boyfriend was excited to chase after them, while i was a bit scared. i was shaking as we ran outside and through the apartment complex. we would stop and see another blinking triangle flying above us. at one point while we stopped to film, a helicopter flew overhead, my boyfriend confirming my suggestion that it was military. at this point, i filmed possibly another slow-moving disc across the street. it looked the same or similar as the first one.\r\n\r\nwe split up and i went back to my apartment building to review footage. my boyfriend soon joined me. he said he ran into two guys while he was running around who sitting on their balcony who were seeing the same triangles flying around. i encouraged him to call the police to report the sighting because i thought, \"there is no way we are the only people seeing these!\" he called and we went inside because i was cold, and he continued to watch from the deck. i went out occasionally to look. i'd see the triangles fly over us on the balcony once in a while. at one point, i was sitting on the balcony by myself. i noticed one triangle going slowly across the sky, and it almost looked like it would \"drop\" something every few seconds, like a yellow beam or ball of light.\r\n\r\nthere was one very bright \"star\" present for the duration of the sighting that my boyfriend said was a ufo. i said it was probably a star or planet. by the time we stopped seeing the triangles, the star was mysteriously gone. it was a completely clear night.\r\n\r\nmy boyfriend received a call from a man from the faa. he described the sighting to him, and the man apparently said that he would be completely skeptical if it were not for someone in reed city reporting something similar 30 minutes earlier. i did not directly observe this, but my boyfriend swears he saw a silver disc speed off in the distance at incredible speeds. at about 12:30 am, my boyfriend stopped seeing triangles or other ufos. the last one i personally saw had more of a diamond shape with an additional small white light.\r\n\r\ni'm a fan of the supernatural, and i love pondering what we don't know and what could be possible about our world. but throughout this experience, i was scared. to be honest, part of me felt that i didn't want to be seeing this. it was a \"why me?\" sort of feeling. i kept trying to be skeptical throughout this experience, and i looked up possible human explanations. the only possible ones i can find are drones (the videos i've been watching of them flying at night don't really look similar to what i saw, plus why so many?) or some kind of secret military devices (though why would they be flying them in clear sight?). \r\n\r\nif there was just one object, it would have been easier for me to dismiss as some sort of a drone, but the number of these things we saw made me doubt that explanation a lot. also, the faa person my boyfriend talked to said he knows the person who flew the military helicopter over, and he didn't report seeing anything. if they were drones, i think they would have just said they were drones. we both suspect some sort of cover-up. it was an overall spooky experience for me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

whilst i am awake and i have seen an alien by my bed using some device that buzzes like a dentists drill... it scared me so i opened my eyes and tried to kick the alien in the head he moved back in time to avoid my blow but i noticed he had a kind of tattoo on his face a black line that was over his eye and down the side of his face it zig zaged...  there was a time previous to this that i was visited by about 4 or five aliens and they kind of milled around in my living room and they came up to me and kissed me and i cuddled them but somehow i reacted badly and attacked one of the aliens pushing my fingersb into his eye sockets and after this the visits stopped until i tried to get them to return and appologised profusely.  once i was taken to a ship and put on a table and one of the aliens extracted some of my facses and he squeezed it through his fingers whilst he looked a little puzzled i know this is because of my old addiction to heroin because it makes your poo hard when yu use the drug opium... mostly the aliens just hug and pet you like maybe you would with a dog as they want to make friends with us i think.. i think the purpose of the genetic experiments is to make humans that can lay eggs because live birth is strange on their planet.... i have met and had sex with women who have an enlarged vagina so they can lay eggs and i have also seen their experiments with dogs that have hands and kind of crawl about","distance":"20 Feet or

seen plenty of weird things in the sky but this is by far the most amazing!! since i was a lil girl i've always looked up skyward and will always do this. maybe one day i'll catch even better pics

aircraft enthusiast and when the mke active is 7r, it is not unusual to see inbound traffic out of the southwest/west. this was not an airliner although i thought it might be a bizjet headed for crites. the unknown had only three (3) white lights arranged in a triangle. absolutely no nav lights or blinking strobes. my route has me turning right and then up a slight grade that gives you a good view (approx. 20 miles) of the airspace north to waukesha. in the 20-30 seconds that the object was out of my sight, it had vanished. the usual array of tv news choppers can be seen easily at the same distance if they are out and about. due to the darkness, no physical form was visible.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the sky.  i noticed around eight separate contrails from different objects but could not see the objects and thought to my self that it was very strange because planes cannot fly that close together or they would crash into each other.  then after about a minute i saw a low plane flying under the trails. it was very far under the trails so i knew it had not generated them.  then that plane flew away and i saw one of the trails go completely straight up in the air. i thought to myself that cannot be a plane because it was going straight up like a roller coaster would do.  i ran in the kitchen and got my phone and started taking pictures. it was completely vertical. then after about a minute or two of going straight up it moved toward my house coming south east.  i watched it as it went over my house and the object in front of the trails was gold and glowing and oval/egg shaped. it did not look like a plane and i was directly under it. i kept taking pictures. it was moving fairly slow. then it left my viewing site.  very strange incident. i looked at the pictures and blew them up on my phone and as i thought it was not a plane. i kept going over it in my head and just kept thinking how it went completely vertical and straight up in the air before it turned and went over my house. the other odd feature was the bright gold color.","distance":"101-500

that night we all saw something pretty incredible.  kyle noticed it first and got everyone's attention. my buddy and his girlfriend saw it next. when my girlfriend and i spotted it i started to record it on my iphone.\r\n\r\nwe saw a craft with no clear edges or sides and it seemed to emanate ever changing light from its entirety thereby obscuring it's surface. it appeared to be 20-50 foot in length although its exact distance from me was not easy to judge so i couldn't say to any certainty its size or shape. it appeared to be in our neighborhood and hovering over the rooftops and a height of no more than a few hundred feet. i would say it was about 200-400 feet away from where we were all standing in our back yard. it would hover then move slowly then quickly, alternating between the three. when i say quickly i mean instantaneously. i would estimate that from the time we first saw it until it became stationary it traveled a couple thousand feet. this all took about 30 seconds. it then sat there for about 15 seconds at which point it started pulsing, let out a very soft but weird kind of electrical whine and then flew almost directly away from us towards the southern horizon at extremely high speed, then abruptly made an almost right angle turn to a course of almost straight up and at an unbelievably high rate of speed......All while staying directly in the center of our field of view. \r\n\r\nduring this whole time the object didn't make a sound. not even the sound of air rushing over it as it whipped by us!!! it did let out a strange electrical noise, like it was charging up to take off and that's exactly what it did. 6 of us watched it and i have the whole thing on video. that's another oddity, what we saw with out eyes appeared maybe 30 foot across but it hardly showed up on the video, like it what cloaking itself or messing with the camera. \r\n\r\ni can't say what it is that i saw with any certainty but, i believe that it was not a plane, helicopter, rocket, jet, ballon, lantern or anything like weather phenomenon. it seemed to move intelligently and as weird as this sounds, it seemed biological in the nature of its movements and lighting.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional
