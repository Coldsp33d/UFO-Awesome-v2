was about 10 meters in diameter. the lighting in the area of the object was in was poor. no traffic at the airport, no activity in the tower. i think the airport was disused at this time. no sound was heard. i observed this for about three minutes and did not arrive at what it could be. i continued to go home to målilla.\r\n\r\ni'm going out on the road 34, and run past the first roundabout after

about things, and this mass ufo sighting was unlike anything i've ever seen on youtube.-\r\n\r\nthis happened during st. patricks day so i'm going to start first by saying my girlfriend and i were both sober the entire night. \r\n\r\nmy girlfriend and i were sitting on the couch watching gravity falls together. i turned my head and saw about 8 red lights connected to a flying saucer-type ufo. it had 2 white lights on the bottom of it. this first ufo hovered directly over our apartment building, over the parking lot, and behind the building across the lot. we got up and watched it, thinking it might be a helicopter at first, but it was not. we ran outside, chased it behind the building, and in under 2 minutes it was over a mile away. this ufo was about 250+ feet long and about 80 feet tall. \r\n\r\nafter observing this ufo flying away we noticed about 3 red and white blinking lights, all in separate directions. after a few seconds of watching them, we began moving to observe them closer. we began noticing more and more, until we saw about 8 different ufos. a couple flew over us and we noticed they were black triangle ufos. they flew over about a minute apart from one another.\r\n\r\nafter seeing those triangle ufos and observing 8 different ufo, red and white blinking lights, we tried getting closer to one that was moving towards us. as we got closer and got a decent video of it, a black military helicopter flew right by us.\r\n(here is the interesting thing. i called 911, and reported these ufos in my area. about 30 minutes later the faa(federal ariel administration) contacted me and began asking me questions about what i was seeing. he talked with the pilot of the helicopter that flew by us, and funny enough the pilot told him he didn't see a thing. we have video of his helicopter in the same frame as the triangle ufo, within a few hundred feet of each other.)\r\n\r\nafter the black helicopter flew by we moved again to see another triangle ufo fly closer to the ground, like 200 feet above the ground. at this point i ran ahead of my girlfriend and ended up getting separated trying to keep up with the ufo that was flying right over the woods. after watching several other red/white blinking lights fly around in different directions i started trying to follow the ones closer to me to get the best videos i could.\r\n\r\nat this point i ran into two guys smoking on their balcony in the apartment complex my girlfriend lives in. they asked me if i saw the ufos and the flying triangles, i said yes. we even talked about the black helicopter with green lights. a few minutes later another ufo descended and and flew past the woods, so i split from those guys and started chasing it to get a better video, but it was too fast and i just got a couple lights behind the trees.\r\n\r\nafter running around for near 40 minutes i met back up with my girlfriend. we went inside and stood on her balcony and watched 15+ red/white blinking ufos in the distance. a few minutes of watching them from a distance a few of them flew over us.\r\n\r\none of the ones that flew over us had 3 red lights in a triangle pattern, and a white light in the back forming a diamond shape. this was the only diamond shape we saw.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend started getting cold so she went inside. as i was watching a red/white flashing ufo triangle a mile away, a grey/silver disk about 30ft wide and 15ft high zipped between me and the ufo i was watching. this disk was about 150 feet off the ground and about 100ft away from me. i only caught it for a split second and it didn't have any lights on it.\r\n\r\ni got a call from the faa, but my phone dropped the call mid-conversation. so i called him back on my girlfriends phone. i explained to him everything we witnessed and assured him i'd send him emails with these videos. he said there was a similar case that happened in reed, michigan a little earlier, which is why he called me asap. as i was talking to him i saw a bright white streak across the sky, about as wide as a basketball at arms-length for a split second. this was unlike a sattelite entering the atmosphere or a shooting star/meteor. i've seen them before and it was unlike anything i'd ever seen.\r\n\r\nthis is the video from reed, michigan, posted on mufon earlier this night.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Mufoncms.Com/files_jeud8334j/64011_submitter_file1__trim.E07b0fd9a61e4f5898b6a20746327c5b.Mov\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend brought a blanket and binoculars out and we ended up watching the ufos fly north and south, right past each other. they were about 150ft above/below one another, flying in opposite directions. they did this 3 or 4 times before they flew out of sight.\r\n\r\ni noticed a bright white light, the size of an asprin straight across from our balcony, a mile out. at first i thought it was a ufo, but it didn't blink or move, and gave off the same light as a star. my girlfriend convinced me it was a star so after the ufos stopped showing up we went inside and i started checking out all of the videos. about 30 minutes later i glanced out the window and the star i thought was a ufo was completely gone, as if it had not been there. this was a completely cloudless night by the way.\r\n\r\na few hours later(3am michigan/ohio time) i showed the videos to my friend in ohio over skype. she looked out her window and witnessed 3-4 of the same red/white blinking objects flying in the distance, and one of her friends took a photo of them.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path

that was/is. on february 10, 2015 when i was walking up the end of my driveway after getting the mail from the box, i glanced up at the beautiful, cloudless sky and a flutter grabbed my attention. insects were flying high above me and the sunlight was shining through their wings making them look like sparkling tinkerbells. i wanted to watch them longer but the sun was too bright. then i realized if i stood in the shadow of the utility pole close to the end of the driveway, i could use it to block out the sun and enjoy the sight a bit longer. i stood there for about 30 seconds or so when another movement caught my eye. it was close to the sun and looked like a white crescent cloud, but it wasn't a cloud and was cupped toward the sun. it went straight into the sun and was gone. it only lasted a second or two. a few seconds later another appeared, the same shape though a tiny bit larger, moving at the same speed but from another angle and it too disappeared into the sun. then a third appeared about 10 seconds later and was about the same size as the first. their length was roughly about one fifth compared to the diameter of the sun. what held my attention was the fact that they were going into the sun and not away from it. i watched for about 10 minutes and saw about a dozen of these things. have no idea what they are. they didn't look anything like the insects still fluttering several yards away from the utility pole. went out earlier the next day, but didn't see any. i am going out again in a few minutes and have another look. absolutely incredible to me. as of now, march 18, 2015, have not seen crescents again.  have not had a day with as clear sky as that day. am curious to know if anyone else has ever seen this phenomena. my android phone camera couldn't

i thought was a white remote control airplane coming from a farm field in the distance from the left. i pointed it out to the driver and said, \"look at that remote control plane\". that's when he said, \"no that is too big to be a model plane.\"\r\ni thought it was a remote control plane by the way it was flying. by that time it was making a pass from the left field to the road we were on, but still ahead of us. this is also when i came to the realization that the plane was indeed too big to be a model, too high up and too fast. then the biplane hovered over the road and turned into what looked like a crop duster. i said to the driver, \"did you see that?!?\" and he \"said yea it looks like a crop duster\". at this point im thinking this is impossible, but i just confirmed what i saw. the road had no cars on it ahead of us at the time so the driver could watch this plane or whatever it was with me. im thinking the whole time take out your camera phone. tell him to pull over, but all we bot could do was watch. next the plane took off over the farm field to the right of us made a slight turn and did the second impossible thing. it disappeared. not in a flash of light, or went supersonic, it was just there and then not. before either of us could verbally react it reappeared as a small jet facing the way it was trying to turn. the way it was flying made me make a joke, \"hey that plane now reminds me of my jet in gtav\", a video game i play. it was flying back over the road, made an impossibly tight turn over the left field back over to the road again. it was not going particularly fast, that's why we had such a good view, it was also completely silent. yes we had the windows open, and the radio off. then it made a sharp turn in the right side field. at his point im thinking there is no plane i have seen, in real life or on tv that can maneuver better than my video game jet. i commented on this and the driver agreed. he was in disbelief too that a plane could move like that. the last thing it did was fly back over across the road to the left field and hover as a helicopter would. no it did not morph into a hover craft to land. it stayed looking the same white jet that it had last morphed into. at that point on the road we were aside it. it was about 1/4 mile away the last position i saw it in was hovering about 50 feet from the ground. there was no dust, or debris being kicked up whatsoever. then a small tree line was in the way as we passed. i looked back for the plane, but nothing was there.\r\nbeing in the moment we discussed it a bit. as i said its disbelief and i was trying to find every logical answer as to what it could be. we actually did not talk about it for a whole day just to see if we came up with the same story a day later. we did. this is when i decided to report my sighting. i was not alone. it was in bright daylight. we both saw the aircraft. i still can not explain what i saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

outside no people nothing. i was about to cross the road to go home to my flat when first i looked up in the sky in this same direction i always look in, for 2 reasons, i love the orion constellation and where i am i get too see it quite often so i am always looking for it, the second reason is because i have had 2 previous sightings in this same area just as weird as this one. so i noticed the strange light because it was not moving, it looked pure red with a reddish glow and was round and about 6 ft wide and 6 ft tall. i stayed still looking at it to see if it was just a star not moving or the movement of the clouds eluding me. then about 20 seconds after the stare off it suddenly started moving at about 10 miles per hour and i was standing still trying to make out if it was a plane or one of these ufos i have seen in the past. it was not high up at all maybe about 150 ft.And this circle ball of light moved across the road next to the building i live in, so i decided to follow it and get as close as possible and forgetting to mention the whole experience there was no sound emitted. so i was walking to try and get underneath it while it was still stationary and as i was walking i got on the phone to my girlfriend and i got under some trees and could faintly see it and when i got out from underneath the tree i looked up and i see approximately 5 of the same balls of light in a complete small circle i stood and looked up in shock and after about 3 seconds they literally just vanished from the sky as if they had a switch to turn the lights off. i waited around 10 minuets

east. i lost sight when my view was blocked by my building. i took about 15 pics with my phone. not the best camera and i couldn't see anything when i looked back and zoomed in.  i have sent the pics forward to a mufon investigator. a little time after seeing the orb, and i can't remember how long, another military helicopter flew over in the same route and the previous two. i took a pic... 5:08pm

by army intelligence when it hit ground directly below dogfight area.  this material was analyzed by dr robert sarbacher dod scientist and said material was composed of magnesium-orthosilicate and embedded every 10 microns with spheres of bismuth. bismuth being the most highly anti-magnetic substance known to man. it appears this served as an insulating device of the hull to keep hull surface from becoming magnetized. it would appear the the huge negative magnetic field generated by the craft; allows it to float in our atmosphere at will by dialing up the field in intensity to rise and lowering it to land. the power supply must be some form of cold nuclear fusion to allow for the extreme acceleration and rates of climb. this was initially reported in frank edwards book flying saucers - serious business in the middle 1960's but was ignored by the press. i think we need to take another look at this book. frank died not too long after publication. george meaney told him to

maybe green. it was flying faster than i've ever seen something fly before. it would make a hundred eighty degree turn and be full speed in a split second. when airplanes turn they make large banking turns, yet this object made precise fluid turns on a dime that would kill a pilot from the g forces if they were flying this object. it made a pattern in the sky like two s's on top of each other while lowering it's altitude and then shot off westbound angled at about a 55 to 60 degree angle towards the sky disappearing in the blink of an eye. the whole sighting last maybe a minute  or less. i first thought it was venus because when i first witnessed it it was just hovering stationary in the sky. then i thought it was just a plane that was moving very slowly on the horizon giving the illusion that it was stationary, but then it started to move very very fast eastbound towards my house. i didn't take out my camera because by the time i realized that it was moving unlike anything i've seen, until the time it disappeared was maybe only 10 15 seconds tops. i was yelling for my fiance to hurry up and get out back so she could witness it as well but it shot off right before she got out back. the strange part is, on march 6th of this year, 10 days ago, i witnessed roughly seven objects in the sky that looked very similar to this. they were the same color yet they left fireball tails behind them almost like a comet. they were in the sky making different patterns, and then all of them either shot off  at an alarming rate of speed or blinked out in succession. so in a matter of 10 days i have had two ufo sightings. a quick google search yielded statements from other people here locally in the peoria arizona area saying they have witnessed very similar objects in the sky over peoria. about a year, to maybe a year and a half ago, my fiance and 2 kids also witnessed something just like this while driving home from her mother's house 4 miles away. i was able to see it after she called me on the phone and told me where to look right before they blinked out as well. it shook her up pretty bad, she thought they were meteors falling to earth until they started moving around doing different patterns and disappeared. this is a definite ufo flap and i think somebody needs to seriously investigate what is going on here.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
