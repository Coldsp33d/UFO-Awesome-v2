one day my brother remembers seeing something fly by our bay window and my mom coraborates that he started yelling and went running outside to chase it. he was about 10 at the time. he says he remembers it being mettalic and small...Like frisbee sized and that it flew in front of the window and then flew off. \r\n\r\n4- my mom and brother one day witnessed a 'cloud' above the house move at right angles and zip around.\r\n\r\nagain, our house was 200 acres in the middle of no place. my mom said something about the locals in readsboro calling it ufo mountain at the time....So anyway may be worth it for you guys to look into this town and see if these things continue. \r\n\r\ni was a little kid at the time like 3 - 6 years old or something. i don't recall having anything happen to me personally. again, please don't post any of this ...Especially my name ....Just want you to know about this town in vermont and that back when we were there in the 70s / early 80s. seems lots of weird stuff was going on. \r\n\r\n\r\nalso please not phone numbers given are random / invented...I really don't want to be contacted by phone.

him and his girl friend were watching these\r\nufo's or flying lights above their home. they were very excited and said\r\nthey had been watching them for quit a while, not sure exactly how long,\r\nbut at least a few minutes. my son was describing the first one that got\r\nhis attention as the mother ship. he described it as three white lights\r\nthat were in triangle formation at shoulder width apart if your hands were\r\nheld at arms length. he said that he thought it was a solid black object\r\nbetween the light. after that he and his girl friend saw more groups of lights moving across the sky. they had been watching them for around 15 to 20 minutes by this time,( i'm writing this the morning after the event and\r\nhaven't talked with him since last night), so the time maybe a little off.\r\n     they had been laying in their backyard on their trampoline looking at the sky, as it was one of the first nice day's since the bad winter weather, and began to notice the lights. they said i should come over and check it out. i grabbed my binoculars and video camera and headed over.\r\nthey live in town about 2 to 3 miles away. when i got there they came out to met me and were still very excited. i didn't believe they would still be\r\nthere,( the lights) when i got there. they began telling me more about it as they\r\npointed to the sky. i was looking up also, as they told me, hoping to catch a glimpse of something but not really expecting it, when three lights in triangle formation when zipping almost over head. they were going south to north at a high rate of speed. i would estimate their size as the size of an around your thumb at arms length. this is a guess as i think back on it today as i didn't stick my thumb up in the air when it happened. anyway i thought, well at least i got to see one. little did i know of what was to come. \r\n    well, they began asking me what it was, right off the bat i knew i couldn't explain it, and by this time this event had been going on for at least half an hour. the sighting lasted for over 2 more hours with between 30 to 50 groups of lights,at least, traveling in all directions, mainly north, some making swerving high speed turns. some lights stayed in fixed positions to each other some did not. some lights were rectangle some round, and one looked like 3 brightly lite seagull wings that moved closer and farther apart from each other as they speed across the sky. this group i observed with my binoculars and was the most impressive to me. some of the lights that made up the formations were clearly seen as rectangular lite white lights that stayed in fixed formation as they sped at high speeds across the sky. the smaller groups moved faster than the large ones. the mother ship my son saw moved the slowest. they event seemed to peek in intensity after about an hour or so and began to taper down only to surge back up again a little later. as we lay watching this on the trampoline it just seemed surreal to me. it was like watching a fireworks display. it began to overwhelm me in being able to keep track of what i was seeing. it was unbelievable yet there it was, like a space highway in the sky. the sky had a thin cloud cover with clear spots here and there. some were seen through the light clouds, some very clear in the openings. i have been interested in the subject since i was a young boy, i'm now in my sixty's, and that's probably why they called me. i've always been interested in astronomy and have owned more telescope than i can remember and logged many, many, many hours sky watching and never experienced anything like this. i have no idea what it is. nothing i know of can fit the bill. there were four of us who witnessed this, their daughter came out after about an hour or so to watch. i would think that others would have had to witness this. after two hours or so it was getting late and my son had to work that day and the ufo flap was winding down and we decided to hang it up. after i returned home i went outside to see if i could see anything, but nothing. i did try to use my video camera but it would only pickup dark sky. i'm not really a camera guy and you may be able to set it to record at night but i have never used it that way. i do believe that these lights were working together and had a common purpose, all appearing in the same wave and mostly going in the same direction. they seemed to move alike and made up of the same kind of lights. anyway i thought this sighting was significant enough to report. hopefully more witnesses will come forward and report this and possibly add more details.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

noticed a bright white orb hovering  above a small skyscraper and got my cousins attention. at first we thought helicopter but no aviation lights and it did not move. we then saw a high flying airplane going by it but at a much higher altitude and they were not even close to the same let alone no airplanes just hover. we then thought maybe it was a tower on the top of the skyscraper with the lights for low flying traffic. so i got out my digital camera and my cousin got out his apple i 6 plus and we zoomed in on it. it was not a tower as nothing was attached to it. he took a pic of it and i got a nice zoomed in shot of it. we then moved across the alley to an open lot with a clearer view of the object and he took more photos and i shot a few more videos of it. after 15 minutes we noticed it was actually moving but very slowly across the sky. we then left. after we got home we uploaded our pictures and videos and looked at them closer. the weird thing was 2 of his shots had a different craft in it along with the orb that we did not see and did not show up on my video. it was different than the white orb. it was 2 yellow orbs together. now the first sighting was nw of the parking lot outside of my building and it's slow path was going n.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

 during my ride in the darker rural areas i noticed a cluster of stars and was debating if it was perseus, so i decided to go out onto my deck to see if i could determine for sure.  i was looking toward orion, i had used orion as a reference point earlier, when \"movement\" of something caught my attention to the west of orion. it took me a second to understand what i was observing move through the sky because it was almost identical to the color(s) of the night sky, except for the edge which seemed to be ever so slightly reflecting light from the town below it.\r\na large circular shaped object, mimicking the night sky in color, as if for camouflage, was moving in the west going north.  there are a few stratus clouds(guessing they are under 6,000 ft.) tonight and this circular object was below the cloud cover, which is probably the only reason i was able to get a visual fix on it.  it was blocking the clouds behind it, even though it was the exact color of the night sky, it faintly stood out because of the cloud cover and the edges having an ever so faint light reflection.\r\nits flight path was steady and smooth. when i realized i was seeing something out of the ordinary, i focused on whether i could hear any sound, there was no sound, and there were no contrails of any kind.  i held my fist up to try to determine size, it was larger than my fist at arms length.\r\ni lost sight of it due to a tree line and as it got further away, the edges were not as easy to make out visually.\r\ni would say my reaction was of being in awe.  i know i said out loud to myself, 'what was that.....What was that?'  i stood on the deck for about five minutes, looking to see if there were possibly others in the area.  i then became uneasy standing out there and returned into the house.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

clearly not a house or yard light, it was much larger and brighter- did not see a craft- i stared at it for 15 minutes and thought there was no way i was going to pass,i was nervous and was not up to meeting with our star neighbors that evening-i turned around to go the the woody creek community center to have other folks take a look to confirm what i was seeing and as i was driving i was curious to see if the light was still there so pulled over and looked north west and it was gone.\r\n\r\ni was extremely nervous to travel back home in the direction where \r\ni saw the hovering light but i

judging distance. that being said, here are some guesses at distance and size and what else i saw. the night was so dark to me i couldn't see any part of the thing except lights.\r\n\r\nthe craft (i don't know what else to call it) was probably about 300 to 500 feet off the ground. i have no idea of how big the light was on the front, but it might have been 15 to 20 feet in diameter. about what i'd guess to be 50 - 100 feet behind where that light was there was a small green flashing light. then about the same distance behind that was an elongated red light in a vertical position. there was also another red light just to the left of the larger one that was shaped exactly like the other red one, but it was smaller. maybe half the size of the other one or a little less. i got the idea that this light was on the far side of the craft. if so, this would have made it pretty wide in that area.\r\n\r\ni have no idea of noise since i was driving. when it turned to the south, it was a little north of me. as it passed me, i was trying to keep my car on the highway and watch it at the same time. i only saw the side lights for a 10 to 15 seconds then it was behind me and i lost it.\r\n\r\nthere were other cars on the four lane and i'm sure others saw it as well.\r\n\r\ni've never seen a ghost or a bigfoot, but now i have a hard time going outside without watching the sky and wondering what i saw. i nearly didn't file this because i didn't want people thinking i'm crazy.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

minutes until news years on the east coast. i went out the back door to have a cigarette. i looked to the north and noticed a bright red/orange light. \r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a helicopter but did not see any blinking navigation lights which struck me as odd. the object looked to be approximately 5 miles up valley slowly heading from north to south at an altitude of approximately 100/150 feet. i watched it move south for about 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nas it got closer and closer it remained fuzzy around the edges. it stopped traveling south and became stationary about what looked to be 4-5 blocks away at an altitude of approximately 100 feet. there was absolutely no sound. it remained stationary for 30 seconds or so and then began moving in a westerly direction while slightly gaining altitude at maybe 5/10 degrees. within 6 seconds it got so small i could not follow it in the night sky.\r\n\r\nit must have accelerated at an incredible rate of speed to have disappeared that quickly. the acceleration was not a single burst of speed but rather smoothly. we live in the flight path for the north/south corridor for aircraft out of san francisco/oakland/san jose airports and watch many airplanes traveling around 300/400 miles an hour above us. this had to move at least 20 times faster than them.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

rainbow was showing.  i was taking photos of the rainbow and didn't actually notice the lights in the frame.\r\n\r\ni took a series of photos to catch as much of the rainbow as i could but after transferring to a memory chip i put them away and forgot about them.\r\n\r\ni was sorting through old memory chips a few days ago when i found these photos.  the first one showed a couple of ellipses with what appeared to be a solid centre. this was at 15.24 gmt. the next photo showed two large balls of light low to the ground and apparently in front of the lamp post.  the time of the photo was also 15.24 so the lights had moved very quickly.\r\n\r\ni think it may have been reflection off something because there were a handful of cars in the carpark, but none moving to the best of my recollection.  the angle of each photo is slightly different but not by as much as the difference in position of the two sets of lights.  also the first ones were very small and seemed distant, the second ones larger and closer.\r\n\r\ni would love to know what created this phenomenon or if i have caught something awesome on camera.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":63961,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":52.4260312,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-03152015-0003","longitude":-1.4342649,"occurred":1257377400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1426437794000,"summary":"Two

thanksgiving gathering in lincoln, ca.  i went into our master bedrm. put the cat window perch up in window . the window faces out to the front yard/street. it is a high window.  i am 5'7\"and the bottom of window comes to my chin.I put my cat up on tall dresser (just under the window) he then can jump from dresser to window. about ten or so minutes passed, i had changed into my pjs, no lights (except a night light) were on in the bedroom.  i walked up to stand next to my cat and look out.  thats when i saw five or more very big glowing,flashing balls of redish/orangish lights.  they seemed to be in a line formation. up and down, spaced the same amount between each other.  i yelled to my fiance to hurry up you have to come see this. he was in  our family room.He came and he too could not believe what we were looking at. we both wanted to get our cameras or phones but knew if we did they might be gone. within a minute a couple dissappeared. then three made a triangle shape for about a minute or two. i ran out the front door to the driveway and a minute later they all were gone. i posted it on my facebook with hopeing someone else saw the same thing. but nothing.Please i would really like to know if there were any other reports of this on thanksgiving night in sacramento, ca. ??","distance":"Over One
