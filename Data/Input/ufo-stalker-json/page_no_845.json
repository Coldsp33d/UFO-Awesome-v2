(my location in 2 miles south and 4 miles west of the south end of the runway at hill afb) this is not a normal approach to hill afb, we heard no noise but the jets in the hot tub were running, as soon as we could shut them off only normal surface traffic noise could be heard.  other aircraft going into hill afb can usually be heard over the jets in the hot tube.  normally aircraft approaching hill afb would be 500 to 1000 feet higher and 4 miles further east.\r\ni have a lifetime of observing aircraft, i have worked on active flying aircraft for 20 years, 10 years with boeing experimental flight test.  i have never observed any low flying aircraft with absolutely no lights and i have never seen the odd greyish glow on anything so have no further description or comparison.\r\nit was odd and un-nerving and immediately ended our time in the hot tub and send us in to the house for the evening.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

photos. nothing seemed unusual at the time. after the photos were taken i went to start the car and it would not start. i checked my watch to see what time it was and it had stopped. seemed just like a coincidence. we left in a different car and the rest of the day seemed normal also aside from feeling queasy . when we returned home the car started right up and my watch started working about 1 hour after it had stopped.\r\n\r\na couple of days later we had the film developed only to find this strange translucent oddly shaped anomaly present in both the picture and negative directly above my daughters head. being a professional photographer it was unlike anything i had ever seen. i did considerable investigation and follow up initially including contacting the film manufacturer and consultation with several professionals only to find more questions than answers.\r\n\r\ni have had the film analysed and the results found were not consistent with what would be expected given any of the possible suspected causes of the anomaly. the physical proof is not rationally explainable.\r\n\r\nin short every professional spoken with and my own education regarding this gives the same conclusion. it makes no sense and should not be possible.\r\n\r\nlater that day i felt ill (nauseous) for quite some time and i had a hard time concentrating. after seeing the photo i no longer believe the problem with the car and my watch was just a coincidence. also from that point forward my daughter developed exceptional artistic skills and is now in one of the finest art programs in the nation.\r\n\r\nthere is much i can explain about why this is unusual and the proof regarding that but it is best done in conversation rather than writing as it is quite complicated. \r\n\r\ni have the original pictures and negatives from this incident but do not wish to send them via the web. i would be glad to provide them for inspection and/or analysis. i have attached a drawing of what the object looks like. this has troubled me for years and i would like to get as much info about this as i now possibly can. please help.\r\n\r\nmy wife believes this is a matter of faith, but i am more sceptical. we initially contacted her local priest who put us in touch with the cardinal. the cardinal after seeing the picture and requesting a copy, later requested that the original picture and negatives be submitted to the vatican for further analysis. when asked if we would get them returned he said that was not possible so we kept them.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

over our field and saw a huge what appeared to be a fire. it was really windy so i got alarmed that it might catch the whole area on fire. at that time i saw the red fire glowing it was so bright it shined above the trees and you could see like smoke billowing up. i ran and told my wife and daughter there was a fire and i had to go check on it. i came back out less then 2 minutes later and ran to my 4 wheeler and looked over and could not see the fire and couldn't figure how that could be possible, i grabbed a pair of binoculars from the tractor and looked through and saw what appeared to be red hot ambers and coals in a diagonal angle left being the high point coming down to the right. i jumped on my 4 wheeler and went across my field to the fence. i could still see the fire under the tree branches. but it was going in and out but was still there. everything seemed odd at that point, i couldn't figure how they got that fire under control so quick and i hadn't seen anyone over there nor could i hear anyone. then off to the left i saw a light from a flash light maybe shining it down towards where the fire was then it turned away and i saw red light. a couple planes flew by and i swore i saw one out in the air behind the tree when i first saw the fire so i know there must of been other witnesses to this. anyway i yelled over to the people and said hey what are you all doing over there. i got no response but a little more movement and they shine the flashlight over towards my direction and i spotlighted them back but could not make out any shape. i then saw huge flashes of white light in the sky over behind where i saw the flashlights like lightning flashes that stay in the clouds. after that i saw nothing, the fire was gone the flashlights were gone and it just seemed creepy but i climbed under the barbwire determined to see where the fire was. i was in water shoes with no socks walking in palmettos which are like snake houses so i didn't go real far. i felt like there was something there but could see nothing or maybe i was just a little freaked out. but i called out again and asked who was out here but got no reply. i was out there a little over an hour. i looked back to the location that i had originally saw the fire to make sure i was in the right spot and i was but saw no smoke no smouldering ambers. so i decided i would come to look in the morning. this morning i went over there and drove everywhere on that side and up where i saw the flashlights or whatever they were and found nothing. i drove my 4 wheeler up and down the location of the fire and not a trace of a fire. thats when i was sure something strange had happened. i know there is a couple pilots out there that saw something here last night.

was between the age of 12-14 and i can't even remember the time of year but i know it wasn't winter.  i'm writing this now because i've been desperate to know if anyone else has ever experienced something similar and because i've only just recently put together a number of odd events that have happened in my life and there is a possibility it links back to the event in the early 80s.   \r\n\r\nit was sometime after midnight, i was asleep in my bed in a bedroom at the end of a hallway that leads to the stairs descending to the front door.  directly beside my room at a 90 degree is my mother's bedroom and she always falls asleep with the bedroom light on and the door open. the light from her room shines into the hallway and slightly into my room as my door was about 4 inches open.\r\n\r\ni woke up to a strange sound coming the stairs, similar to what a 45 vinyl record would sound like on 33.  i use that analogy because we listened to a lot of vinyl in those years. i can't describe the sound but it wasn't music. there was another sound like a ski jacket rubbing up against the wall and as i could hear it approaching my room, i became terrified.  i brought the blankets up to my nose and peered out over them as the object hovered at my door. all i could see was something black there and light coming from my mother's room glowed below it, where you would expect lower legs and feet.  it was probably 4 or 5 feet high.  it only hovered for maybe 10 seconds and it changed direction and into my mother's bedroom for maybe another 10 seconds.  i could hear it moving and i was too scared to move to help my mother (a shame i have carried with me ever since).\r\n\r\nit changed direction again and i could hear it move into the kitchen next to my mothers room for maybe another 10 seconds. eventually, it moved back out into the hallway and down the stairs.  at that point i flew out of bed and woke my mother in a panic trying to explain to her what i experienced.  she got up and we walked into the kitchen together.  every kitchen cupboard, top and bottom was open, every kitchen chair was out of place, yet i heard none of this activity while the object was in the kitchen and it happened in seconds. we went down the hall and looking down the stairs found the door open.  upon further observation, we discovered the door was still locked. \r\n\r\nyears later 2000/01: i'm in my early 30s and i am the single mother of 2 girls aged 13/14 and (wow, i just made the connection that my oldest daughter was possibly the same age i was when weird things started happening again) my youngest was 6/7, renting the top floor of a house in victoria, vancouver island.  at least 3 or 4 times a night, i would wake up and find my back door wide open and still locked.  everyone thought it was my x-boyfriend trying to make my life difficult. he denied this and offered to stay with me to see if it would happened while he was there.  it did, and he stood there in absolute surprise at the wide open locked back door.  i thought maybe i had a stalker or something and reported it to the police.  i then moved me and my two girls across town to live temporarily with a friend while i tried to figure out what was going on.  my bedroom was beside the front door. within 2 weeks, it started happening again.  i ended up getting back together with my boyfriend and within weeks moved into his townhouse (shortly before 911.  it stopped happening.  \r\n\r\nyears later 2013/14 - i moved in with my fiancé in nanaimo vancouver island, now i find the back door to the kitchen wide open and locked except down, it's daytime when it's happening. i work in an office in the basement of our home and have come upstairs for a coffee and found that door open and unlocked.  all these years i thought i had a stalker, but one night while staying at a friends house over night (my headquarters is in victoria) i woke up to that similar sound i heard as a teenager and immediately regressed and was terrified.  turned out it was my friend's son coming home and music was playing on his cell phone while he was walking up the stairs to the house (my bedroom window was just above it and open slightly to let in fresh air).  before i realized it was him, i forced myself out of bed and down the hall stair to the front door, praying i wouldn't find it open and locked (or something hovering there).  it was my friend's son. thank goodness.  but that was when i made the connection of all the times i found the doors open and locked to when i was a teenager.  \r\n\r\nmaybe it's not connected at all, but i have been left somewhat psychologically scared by all that happened in the early 80s and would love some answers.\r\n\r\nl\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

saw what looked like a low, slow flying plane with bright lights coming in our direction from the nne in a straight path. we went outside with binoculars and as the lights veered-off slightly from the straight path over our house, we saw that there were two distinct objects. they made no sound whatsoever and flew as slow, or slower than a small single engine aircraft. the larger one with very bright lights was boomerang shaped with a yellow-orange pulsating light in \"front\" with two white lights on each side of the yellow-orange at equal distances that also pulsated from bright to faint. the pulsing was not sequential or in any order. in front of this one and moving slightly faster were two smaller red lights in a diagonal configuration, the leading red light lower than the trailing, and flashed similar to an airplane but not sequential. the objects made a sweeping turn from a westerly direction to the sw, and at that point could see a third very faint red light on the smaller object at a point what seemed to be between the other two but did not blink, so it seemed to give the object a triangular shape. as they passed away from our house to the sw then s over the town of elma, the smaller object seemed to take on a slight outline of a triangle. it was clear that the larger object was boomerang shape. as they moved further away, there was a very faint \"whoosh\" sound similar to rushing air but nothing like a prop or jet engine, that lasted maybe 3 or 4 seconds. it did not seem like the objects made any banking motion like a conventional aircraft, but the larger one flew with the right-side slightly higher than the left side, even in straight flight. they flew without any speed change until out of sight. about an hour later, they were seen again well-off in the distance to the ne of our home, moving from left to right with the smaller one behind the larger. we watched them for about 20 minutes making the same sweeping flight path, coming toward our area, then the smaller object made a sudden \"jump\" to be in front of the larger one. they then made a quick change of direction back to the ese and disappeared over the capital state forest. the next day we saw on an elma, wa facebook page that other residents of the town also saw what we did. unfortunately there are no photos or video. at the time of the first sighting we thought the lights were from military aircraft, until we realized they made no sound, were not shaped like and did not fly like a normal aircraft (airplane or helicopter).","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

approximately at 45 degrees.  the object was moving slowly from west to east and when it got to the far east it sped up and disappeared.  i went into my house at twin lakes and came out approximately 10 minutes later and the object was back again and repeated the same thing.  i stayed to see if it would come back for another 15 minutes but it did not return.  the color and appearance was sun like and did not resemble a light from a plane or other night flying device that i have ever seen.  it was not star like in color, but was of bright yellow and orange with irregular edges with the appearance of being on fire.  i took several pictures with my iphone of which two were visible, one is very faint as it was in the southeast as it was about to disappear and the other is very bright and represents the object well.  the night was dark and the quality because of the distance the object was from me is not real good.  i have not explanation for what the object was.  i was very curious but not alarmed or fearful at the sighting.

mind. i'ts difficult for something in a state of free fall to change direction randomly. since the only thing that can change the direction of planets and such is gravity, im pretty sure it was a ufo.
