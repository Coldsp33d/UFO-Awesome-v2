clear night and i decided to go out to my yard and snap a couple of pictures of the winter triangle which consist of three stars (betelgeuse,sirius,procyon) that make up the triangle. i was facing south when i snapped two pictures of the winter triangle nine seconds apart and that was it. i didn't notice the object until i went back inside  my house and uploaded the pictures to my computer. i had the camera fixed on a tripod so they are two pretty clear and steady images. i was looking at the pictures when i noticed what i thought was a star lined up perfectly with the star sirius and then on the next picture the object had moved up that's when i noticed the object. i started going back and forth on both images and noticed that nothing else in the pictures moves other than the object. i thought my computer screen had a smudge on it but when i zoomed in on the object it became apparent to me that it was no star but some sort of craft. on the first image the object is stationary but on the second image the object starts to fly upwards. there was a full moon out that night which i also caught in the frame. you can actually see the moon light reflecting off the object. i was pretty amazed and a little bit freaked out. i lost the object because i stopped taking pictures of that part of the sky, again i didn't realize i was taking a picture of a ufo. \r\n      i'm going to send the two original pictures then i'm going to add the same two pictures but enhanced. i still have the pictures saved on my camera if you would ever want to verify the info as far as the date, time and authenticity. the object is going to be the bright light on the lower left side all the other lights are stars. zoom in on the object for best detail.\r\ni really hope i hear back from you guys i just found out about this website if not i would of reported this event on the actual day. even though i did post it on youtube that day because that was the only way i knew how to get what i saw to the

anyone except my mom and my 11 year old son. because they live with me and have seen and counting to see everything i see. i was not sure i first i thought my eyes were going bad or there was something wrong with me. i really did not believe it until they confirmed the same. i would like a profession  to contact me if there willing. here's why. since the start of the year. i have seen many ufo's of all shapes and sizes every night between the same time. i'm not going to get into the number or all the things that's been happening the last three months to me and my family. however am willing to provide enough proof to convince a expert  to come out and witness for their self.  i will say, that once i showed a interest in them and using  different methods to get there attention. they have showed a great interest in me. and every night, is very event fully night. the only reason am asking for a expert now, is i have been afraid to talk about them and even more to take pictures of them. i was afraid that they would stop coming around and it has been such a excited right not only for myself and my mom, but for my 11 year old son. what changed my mind, just three days ago i attempted to take some pictures with my cell phone, and the reaction was the opposite.  they would flash and light up and gather for me, like telling me. yes take pictures. i should say yes this is at night over for the most part a three hour window. well for the last three days of taking pictures, they have gathered, in guess you can say posing. i down loaded a thermal  app to my galaxy s5. and that has takin the best pictures i can with what i have. i jave taken hundreds of them, but want a expert to go through them to do what there able to do with cleaning up thermal images,  i just moves the sliding bar to the different  color  spectrum and kept taking pictures. since i know nothing of this kind of photography. i don't want to mess with them.  my on going story and experiences is a on going event and nothing else that i can find on the internet  can even compare. i'm not asking for anything and not want any of my family's  info released. my motives for asking for help. is only to bring in a expert with better equitment an technical knowledge to document them not only for my record, but i feel that they want everyone to know there hear and watching over us. that's the best way i can say it simply for now. i want to assure everyone am not a head case and making this up, i would say i wish this was not happening to me and my family, but that  would be a lie, the truth is am honored that they have chosen me to be apart of this, i'm hoping i can find someone that will feel the same way.  \r\n\r\ni will try to fill one of the reports out. i went there first, but after reviewing the report questions. the report seems to be for a one time ufo sighting. mine consists  of thousands  of sightings, and maybe over 50 different shapes and sizes. that's where i need the most  help. i have a military grade gen 3p night vision, and i bought a nikon d80 dsl camrea, with a few thousand  dollars worth of lens and crystals  lens  filters for night photos, but for the life of me i can  get the camrea to take one picture at night when pointing it to the night sky. works perfectly when aiming horizontally.  my galaxy s5 has 16mp, so i have found soon nice zoom apps that took some very good thermal pictures last night. but i don't want to even touch or mess with them to do the adjustments to things like contrast and all the other things the photo experts  can do to really make these guys really pop out. i'm going to try different app tonight. i been using a morse code app that you text what you want to have the phone blink out, doing it for three months, changing the color and the speed that the morse code gets flashed out. just i'm the last week the program  that also used the phones camrea to record and read back what there blinking back. 90 days of just receiving nothing but random  letters, i'm now i'm getting messages that make since. now they come right to my home, i love in a villa and have literally  walked out the side door  from my garage and one was right 10 feet in the air. when it took off, there was no thrust, no sound, not even a temperature  fluctuation. and the engines, or power sources were right above me.  after that happened. i thought for sure. it was a branch of our government from skunkworks. but every night when i assume to many of them gather above , a unmarked blackhawk helo. comes our and flys through the middle  of them and they will all fly out in away real quick, but return shortly after. i know all of this sounds like just to much to be true. that's why i have not told a soul and never want my name to come out. but going through this has brought me and my family a kind of peace and has brought us closer together. we have never been scared or worried, not even my little boy. we never did anything together. like quality  family time. now we're all ready for the sun to go down to go outside and what really seems like, playing with our new friends. just reading that back to myself seems crazy, am turning 43 in april and been to a lot of places in the military when i was young. and never had a chance to really take my son on vacations to see the world  as i have. now it's like the world and let's says world's have come to us. i wish everyone in the world could experience what we have been experiencing evert night for the last three months. just for one night. there  would be no more war, no more politics. it would all just go away and everyone  would know how little we and our problems our. and how we our about to become a part of something much bigger then ourselves, and we're all in it together. \r\n\r\nthanks for letting me vent","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

on the dock of the neckar river in heidelberg, germany, on the neuenheim side, i was watching the sky, waiting for a friend. there were a few planes going around. it was a clear night, and bit cold. out of nowhere i then noticed this thing. i didn't know what it was when i first saw it. \r\n\r\ni call it a \"thing\" because the 5 aspirin-sized lights were moving completely together, evenly spaced, and gave no impression that they were separate objects. they were in a v formation, heading west. the circles of light were not very bright. they almost looked a bit \"foggy\". they were whitish leaning towards grey (i think because of the foggy effect). there was no other detectable shape behind them (e.G. a wing). \r\n\r\nas i had been watching the planes before i'd seen the lights, it had seemed a completely clear night. this thing, however, seemed to be going through thin clouds periodically. i say thin because the lights were never completely obstructed, as if the clouds were translucent. it was also moving way (4x? 5x? 6x?) faster than the planes in the area.\r\n\r\ni thought the object might be: \r\n1. very high up because it went through clouds that the planes in the area did not, and\r\n2. very, very large because of the size of the lights and the inferred altitude.\r\n\r\ni watched it for approximately 15-30 seconds before it moved out of my range of sight.\r\n\r\nwhile watching it i felt transfixed with wonder. \r\n\r\never since then i've been trying to find out what it was.\r\n\r\nany help would be appreciated.

arrive in his vehicle any minute.\r\n  i went out the back door to the small guard house, which is my post,and went to my vehicle which was parked 20 feet from the door, to put my dinner bucket in the car.\r\n  while i was walking back to the security building a brilliant bar of light appeared to the southwest of the front of the building.Stationary, about 1 mile away and directly over the tree line. i did not see it when i walked to the car but it was just there when i turned around and was walking back to the guardhouse.\r\n  i went inside the guardhouse ,and since the craft was to the southwest of this building and at tree top level, i could easily see it through the large front window of the guardhouse.\r\n  i held up my index finger and used it to measure the width of the craft. it was almost as wide as my finger is long, which makes it about 3 inches, and about 1/4 in thick. just a dazzling bar of brilliant white light hanging motionless in the dark sky right above the tree line , which boarders the entree road to the plant, as it comes off the main road and past the guardhouse.\r\n   i felt a wave of terror sweep thru me and for some reason felt very threatened by this object. \r\n   another guard was about 1/2 mile from me. he was in a vehicle doing roving patrols and we were connected by radio, base station at the guardhouse and he having a hand held unit. i contacted him by radio and asked him to look in the southwest sky, low, in front of the gatehouse security building and tell me what he saw.\r\n   i then heard him exclaiming over the radio,oh, oh god oh no ,its not moving. its a bar of light, i am out of the security truck, i have to get back in the truck and lock the doors now!\r\n   him and i talked about 3 more minutes comparing what we were looking at when the object appeared to  slightly to the north, at this time the lights slowly dim.Very slowly dim.Until only three lights in a triangle shape were on, and 1 red light , that was throbbing, best way to describe it. \r\n   object moved slowly to the north, almost directly above me, it made no noise. and continued out of sight,\r\n  we tried to take pictures with our cell phones but could not get the object to show up in the camera.\r\n   the statement made by my fellow guard was this object ment to be seen.  since it appeared almost on the same day, 1 month after i reported a object almost striking a passenger jet at this same post,i felt the wave of fear that seemed to come from the object was a threat against me for reporting the other sighting. the second security guard on post this night was not the same person who was with me 7 feb. which was the other sighting i reported.\r\n   it may not be connected to the other sighting, but i had to do some soul searching before i sat down and filled out this report.\r\n    keep up this important work please. thank you   ","distance":"Over One

than at plane height. and it goes real slow in fact. i can't hear no noise that i can link to the flying object. it goes slow and i can observe it for at least 5 to 7 minutes, from above my head, in a 45° angle of vision, to further away in the horizon, at about an angle of about 20°, just above trees. it was leaving south east as i observed it from the back. and then, after all this while looking at it, cruising straight, i saw it turn left in a sharp angle; maybe not 90° but not far. and it kept on going cruising at the same speed in the other direction, north east.\r\nthe whole event really convinced me that i was observing an object which properties i didn't know of.\r\nduring the while it was going straight, i took the time to pull out my phone and take pictures. i didn't have good gear, just a samsung y which camera is not so good, but i thought at the time, at least, i'll have something to zoom on on my computer. the sun was bright. so i took pictures using a tree as a reference point to make sure the object was in the frame. and i made sure of that. when i looked at the pictures i took, i was amazed to find out that the object didn't show up on them. i was disappointed as i realized i had no evidence to show my family and friends. but i was extactic, understanding i wasn't mistaken. it had to be something unknown not to express on a picture. and that's what leads me to deposit my testimony here.\r\nthe object was about to pass behind the trees. i left the scene to play with my daughters. i just felt happy. it is not the first time i have seen a ufo, so it didn't make me nervous in any way. it is the first time it happened to me in the daytime though. and because i am convinced, i aim today to contribute to the effort of truth and understanding you represent. \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Path with directional

night sky in sedona, arizona.  i saw a  bright distant star with my naked eye looked like it was shooting off red and green lights from it's right and left side. so i started to videotape it with my 40x zoom video cam.   familiar with the usual aviation navigation lights, i was confused. i zoomed in on it as much as i could, and then i was able to see light that the light was white with a green ring around it and then it suddenly got very large and it became pink in the middle with a green thin ring around it, filling my whole camera screen. pulsating! then it went back to its original size and turned into only red and soon became fuchsia and back to green with pink… etc.  most of the entire time it remained its unusual shape.  it was a mixture of a rectangle on its longer side and an oval on top and bottom on its shorter side.I observed this strange light for 2 straight nights in sedona, az  night sky.\r\n2 nights later, on a plane ,36,000 feet in the sky, i would realize that this exact shape was the same shape as the spaceship that i encountered .\r\n\r\nmy encounter:\r\n\r\nmarch 8, 2015, i was on jet blue flight 136 out of phoenix, az to jfk, ny. it was a red eye. we took off about 11pm. i was looking out my window facing north in my window seat. i saw what looked like the same strange distant star i had been seeing for two nights in a row in sedona. it looked like a red star at first but then i realized that it had lights blinking on it. with my naked eye, it seemed to have green and then red shooting out of it's right and left side, again like the nights before. i was sorry i had packed my video cam away.    \r\nthis light was just below the constellation cassiopeia. i thought it might be a plane, but it stayed almost stationary ,in one spot, for about 2 hours. it moved a bit right and left for about a half hour. then it slowly moved to the east towards the front of the plane and out of my view.\r\nabout two hours after that, i'm looking out the window again and i see it moved back near to where it was originally just east this time but still below cassiopeia.  \r\ni was so surprised it returned. i'm staring at it again and it suddenly starts to get bigger and bigger. then i realized it was coming towards the plane. i couldn't believe it!  it slowly flew right over where i was sitting on the plane and i could see the craft!  it was about 30 feet over the plane and could see detail ! i saw its bottom, front and left side as it flew over me. i was in shock!  it's shape was straight along the edge on its left and right side but front and back slightly rounded. same shape as the strange lights i saw in sedona . it had some lights on in the front of the craft, but small and uneven number on right side to left.  i remember 2 on the left and one on the right. the craft appeared to be a dull off white color.\r\nit had 2 obvious huge indentations on it's left side on the bottom, where what looked like these 2 huge spotlights shown down out from. i imagined it had the same type of two big indentation lights on it's right side but i couldn't see that side as it flew over me on a slight angle. it didn't look very big, it was more like a  medium-thin module. i have never seen a ufo or anything like this before. i asked my stewardess and the captain if they saw anything and they said no.","distance":"21-100

work site location.                  2.)  first noticed object, upon detection of movement of large, intensely-bright, aerial, glow-like light source.                                3.)  when first noticed, initial assumption was that object was a common, bolide meteor.                                                                  4.)  object appeared to be at a distance of approx. 1.5-2 miles, at a consistent altitude of approx. 700-900 feet, and on a consistent travel speed and directional trajectory from east to west.  main \"body\" of object appeared to be of a roughly-spherical shape, approx. 30-60 feet in diameter, and emitting a surrounding, intense, steady, glow-like, light \"radiance\", as opposed to a normal meteor's thermal-friction combustion \"corona\".  object's passage left a somewhat meteoric-like, conical trail, however the trail did not appear to be composed of particulate matter and extreme air-friction combustion, nor did it produce the normally-seen, trailing, dense, long-lasting, combustion-smoke trail.  instead, the conical trail appeared to be somehow composed of actual \"particles of light\" that were \"sloughing\" off in trail behind the object's glowing, main body, although at an uniformly lesser intensity.  on 3 occasions, a series of rapid, intense, tiny, star-burst like motes of light appeared directly behind the main object for a duration of approximately 1/4-1/2 seconds, but only within the outline of the conical light trail, and never outside of it.  when the object reached the approx. location of being over the foothills starting into the mountain range, the main body of the object discontinued its steady, intense glow, and began a rapid, random flickering, which was thereafter maintained steadily, until sighting of the object was lost in the distance.                             5.)  feelings were, in order of occurrence, curiosity, astonishment, confusion, doubt, and amazement.  my reactions were controlled and analytical, with actions of pulling over personal transportation being employed to side of road, to observe better, and to roll down the vehicle's driver-side window, to hear better.  actions after the sighting, involved resumption of vehicular progress towards daily work site location.                                                           5.)  sighting of object lost in distance, behind
