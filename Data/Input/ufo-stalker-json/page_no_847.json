sound! it was dark outside,but the object was\r\ndarker than the night sky.If that makes any sense! i watched it move away\r\ntoward town.Probably only 20 or so seconds.I was in total disbelief.What did i see?? my heart was pounding so hard.I was shaking.I ran inside with my dog.I told my family what i just witnessed.Now everyone went outside on\r\nthe front steps of the house to try and see the object.Or where could this\r\nobject have gone? i told them that it went toward town.Which for us is only\r\na few streets away.But it was already gone.I went back outside to the backyard where i first witnessed this object.Hoping that it would come back\r\nso i could see it again.But nothing happened.I didn't see anything.All i know is i wont be able to sleep tonight.It's all i can think about right\r\nnow.Im still shaken by it,but excited at the same time! there is no doubt\r\nin my mind that i was witness to a ufo.","distance":"21-100

were in the backyard visiting, when i noticed a large orange ball of light approaching from the west, fairly low in the sky, headed east. i pointed it out to my friend and daughter. as it came closer, i had the distinct impression that it was a plane, and the engines were on fire, because it appeared to be plane-shaped, and the fire appeared to be in the area where the wings join the body of the plane. it made no noise like a plane does and appeared to be flying above the superstition freeway/us 60, about 2.25 miles south of our house. my daughter and friend thought it was a plane too because they remarked about it in the same manner. i tried to take a picture of it with my iphone 5s when it was close to us, but when i focused on the object, nothing appeared in the square. ( when i took my camera down, i could still see it quite well.) the ball of fire made a turn to the south as if it were headed for williams-gateway, but instead of going due south, it moved more to the southeast. as we watched, the flames started going out, then saw a shower of sparks and couldn't see it any more after that.  i called my husband (he wasn't home at the time) and asked him to get on the ham radio and see what the radio traffic was saying about it. he reported back later that he never heard anything. i called falcon field this morning and asked about a plane in distress and was told nothing of that nature had been reported. i called williams-gateway admin and they also said they had no reports of a plane in distress or a crash. i'm really concerned about this, it was a \"horribly beautiful\" sight in some ways and very scary to watch because i thought it was a plane on fire. i'm relieved it wasn't a plane on fire, but if it wasn't, what was it?","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":63891,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.43740903004467,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03112015-0015","longitude":-111.65548841177332,"occurred":1425970800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1426120951000,"summary":"Large ball of fire passed by my house, turned south, turned into sparks and disappeared.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"85207","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Mesa, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:51932"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Chattanooga","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In 2007 an friend and i were sitting on an old concrete boat ramp by the tennessee river looking at the stars on the clear autumn night. we had a six pack of beer and were both on our second beer each therefore we were not drunk or even feeling the effects of alcohol. \r\n we had put our bottles in a crack in the concrete. we both looked up at the exact same time to see a triangle shaped craft literally appear out of nowhere about 200 feet from us, over the river and perhaps 75 feet above it. it was appox. the size of a 2 bedroom house. it had  white/bluish lights on each end and one yellowish light in the center. only a couple of seconds had passed when this object accelerated behind us. it didn't go directly over us but took a sweeping path around us. it flew in a \"frisbee\" motion.\r\n maybe 7-10 seconds had passed. my friend and i looked at each other and said \"we have just seen a ufo\". right after we had said that it sounded like all of the wildlife that was around us went crazy and were running from something. birds were very loud,crickets were loud and it sounded like a bunch of deer or maybe entities? were running right towards us. this frightened us greatly. so we jumped in my car and drove off very fast. about 15 minutes later curiosity got the best of us so we went back. we got out of the car and looked all around the sky. i happened to look down where our beer bottles were and they were gone! i looked for water lines to see if the river rose and were washed away. i could find absolutely no logical explanation for that. i knew who or whatever it was took them. perhaps for dna through saliva?

a few seconds then it moved what looked like higher. i took a picture with my phone and while i could see it with my eyes i couldnt see it in the picture. then i couldnt see it at all because it had vanished. a moment later i saw it move down and move along the horizon north of me, still well above the ground and away from me. at brief seconds above me again. i decided to run video to try and catch it that way. about 35 seconds later i stopped recording and gave up. the next day i decided to take a closer look at the picture and the video. in the portion of the sky i thought i had seen the object i enlarged it greatly and did find a small dot what seemed like miles in the sky. i went to the video and did the same thing. just toward the end of the video i kept seeing a streak that flashed across the sky. on closer look i found what i believe to be the same object entering the field of view(during the 33rd sec and frame by frame) at tremendous speed,from lower left to upper right, traversing that part of the sky in less than a split second before turning straight up and vanishing. if you do not look at the video frame by frame you will not see it, its moving so fast.

sience, which was released in norway, and was put out to the\r\npublic eatch month.\r\ni wrote an article about the famous ufo crash in roswell at that time.\r\nthe farmer, who was the first person on the crash site, find a piece of\r\nthe ufo's body, and took it to his house.\r\nwhen he examined this piece, he find out that when he put a light source\r\nat the fragment of the piece, he noticed that small light points came\r\nout on the other site of the fragment. when he examined it futher, he\r\nfound out that the lights followed through the fragment, with tiny mirrors\r\nwhich was standing in a quid position agains eatch others, and let the\r\nlight goes through the fragment, from one side to the other. the farmer\r\ncould not understand what this was made for, but he made a drawing about\r\nwhat he discovered. at the time a saw this article, and the comments about\r\nit, no one understand at this point, what this was or could be.\r\nat the end of the 1990s, i was working in a saving bank, here in my home\r\ntown tromsø. the boss at the it department in the bank, told me that they\r\nshould installed a new computer system, which include a new system with\r\nsomething he called fiber cables. i ask him about this new tecnology, and\r\nwant to see how it worked.  when he showed me the drawings on these fiber\r\ncables, i got some of a shock. it was exactly the same as i saw illustarted in this sience magazine in 1969.\r\ni have seen many tv programs about the roswell incident, but never have\r\nseen something mentioned about these fiber cables found on this ufo.\r\nthis convinced me that the ufo crash at roswell was very real, and that\r\nthe goverment in usa, holds back informations about this ufo crash.\r\ni think this issue could have some interest for you, and your work around\r\nufo cases.\r\nbest wishes from\r\n[name

became visible. i simply hit the shutter, never seeing the object in the left upper field of the photo.\r\n\r\nthe next morning when i downloaded the camera, i was shocked by what looked like a jet smoke stream running across one of the frames. however, when i blew up the image, it proved not to be a smoke or vapor stream at all.\r\n\r\nit was a series of lights ranging in every color imaginable, broken up into little square shaped boxes, that appear to slow down suddenly, change direction, and eject something.\r\n\r\nthe strange thing is that i never saw the object in real time. i only captured its existence in my nikon. \r\n\r\nin the original photo, there is a telephone pole in the forefront. i eventually went into photoshop, and removed the pole, because the photo went right onto wikipedia in the ufo article as well as others, and i wanted better composition for its debut. \r\n\r\nthe photo i am sending you, is the original j-peg i saved \"before\" i took the telephone

shaped object with many different color lights hovering about 500 feet from the ground and maybe a quarter mile from me . looking at something i've never seen  it grabbed my attention . as i stood there to observe it and try to come up with an explanation as to what it could of been,i was soon convinced that it was very different from the planes and such that i normally see since the airport is about a mile from where i stayed.As the object hovered in one spot and its different color lights were flashing it quickly moved in a weird pattern covering about a half a mile in less than a second then stopping like it hit a wall and continued to make this weird pattern of flight for about 20 seconds then it slows down almost coming back to where i originally spotted it.I never heard anything from it. as it slowed down hovering but moving very slow  it started heading to my right and away from me. it started to move behind the neighbors pine trees across the street to where i started walking to my left so that i could see it clearly again . when i moved enough to my left to get a full view again it quickly comes back to where i first spotted it except it was a little closer to me this time.I almost felt as if it seen me and was making it clear it seen me as well when it came back from behind the trees and right back in the same place i originally seen it but closer to me that had me on fairs,so hearing stories of abductions and etc.I quickly went back inside where i looked out the window from inside and got to see it head south east very very quickly.The \r\nwhole incident had deffenitiy spooked me as every hair on my body had stood up as i felt overwhelmed by what i had just witnessed.Almost a year later i saw a very bright light which seemed to be coming from the woods behind my house but this time i only seen a light . however there is an airport not far at all from my ufo sighting .The only thing that didn't make sense a year later was that i know airports have a bunch of lights but the one i saw ,i've never seen a light that bright and in  that section of the woods . \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
