          ovni em avarã©-sp, brazil.\r\n\r\ndescriã§ã£o dos fatos ocorridos no dia do avistamento do ovni sobre a represa em avarã©-sp.      \r\n\r\nno dia 19/10/2014, domingo, por volta das 17h:30min, eu voltava da represa jurumirim para avarã©-sp de carro com meus filhos durante um forte vendaval e um tempo muito feio, caracterã­stico da chegada de uma tempestade,...Pequei meu celular e comeã§amos a filmar toda aquela agitaã§ã£o do tempo,...Quando vã­nhamos pela rod. sp255, chegando ao aterro da ponte para atravessã¡-la do lado de itaã­-sp, meu filho de 9 anos disse,...: -olha, tem uma coisa dentro da ã¡gua,...!! o que mais tarde ele disse que parecia ser um balde ou lata de lixo preta,... na hora, ninguã©m mais viu nada ou deu importã¢ncia ao fato e continuamos pela estrada filmando as ondas o cã©u e tudo mais,... ao chegar em casa, passei o filme para o computador e percebi que havia um ponto luminoso no cã©u, acima da represa e em baixa altitude pois as nuvens estavam baixas e ele estava bem abaixo delas,...Meu celular, filma em 21 quadros por segundos e usando o programa bsplayer, consigo ver quadro a quadro,...Entã£o voltei o filme e observei o objeto no cã©u,...Pude perceber que era um ponto luminoso â¨ovalâ¨, com quatro pontos menores ao redor, dois acima e dois abaixo, simetricamente posicionados,... depois voltei o filme ao ponto onde meu filho disse ter visto uma coisa na ã¡gua e comecei a olhar quadro a quadro,... pude constatar que havia sim um objeto na ã¡gua, preto parcialmente submerso,...Avanã§ando o filme, vi que ele â¨mergulhouâ¨ e apareceu novamente,...Depois disso, o objeto aparece e desaparece na ã¡gua vã¡rias vezes sendo que em algumas delas, ele parece estar flutuando no ar, logo acima da ã¡gua e quando se pode ver tambã©m, os pontos acima e abaixo dele, como o do objeto do cã©u, porã©m com cores mais escuras e sem brilho,...O objeto parece ter a forma de uma esfera, as vezes menor, preta e densa e as vezes maior e mais clara, como se inflasse e se tornasse menos densa e com os pontos a sua volta,....Num certo instante, quando ele parece flutuar no ar acima da ã¡gua, de uma fraã§ã£o de segundo para outra, ele desaparece e nã£o aparece mais,.... toda essa filmagem do objeto na ã¡gua nã£o dura mais que 5seg. mas ele pode ser visto em aprox. 64 fotos feitas a partir dos pauses que o programa permite e em menos de 10 fotos, com relativa clareza,...Meu sogro, que tambã©m voltava da represa e estava no carro da frente, disse tambã©m ter visto uma coisa na ã¡gua no mesmo local, e que parecia um tambor preto, desses de 200l, mas com os cantos arredondados, mas tambã©m nã£o deu importã¢ncia pois com aquele vento poderia ser qualquer coisa sendo arrastada,...Mais tarde, depois de assistir ao vã­deo muitas e muitas vezes, reparei outra coisa estranha no cã©u, logo acima e a direita do objeto luminoso,...Sã£o outros quatro ou cinco pontos luminosos entre as nuvens, formando um quadrado ou um pentã¡gono, â¨parecendo ser um outro objetoâ¨, maior, mais alto e mais distante que o primeiro. esse suposto segundo objeto, ainda nã£o estã¡ confirmado podendo ser apenas impressã£o pelo formato e iluminaã§ã£o das nuvens, mas tambã©m impressiona pela posiã§ã£o dos pontos luminosos sugerindo ser algo estranho. o vã­deo e as fotos jã¡ foram enviã¡das a vã¡rios ã³rgã£os e pessoas especializadas no assunto e atã© agora nã£o chegaram a nenhuma conclusã£o,... me pediram que enviasse uma cã³pia do vã­deo para o instituto de criminalã­stica do paranã¡ o qual tambã©m irã¡ investigar o caso. estou aguardando respostas e publicarei assim que chegarem.\r\no vã­deo original e as fotos estã£o no link a seguir.\r\n[link moved to fi section/cms/tg]\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

it was at this point that i noticed what he was talking about. as soon as i stepped off the porch [facing north] i noticed a single globe type object moving directly over my head to the west. it was round, but not perfectly. it was a semi-opaque light which looked as if it had been illuminated from the inside; white outer with a yellow and orange inside color. the light cast a dim ring of illumination that surrounded the semi-opaque object. john told me to look around in the sky while he kept an eye on it. i quickly scanned in all directions and looked back to the object. it moved quickly but not fast, steadily, straight west. it traveled directly between 9th and 10th street, through our backyard. it was fairly close to us, it seemed closer than the helicopters that typically fly in our neighborhood at night. we continued watching it until it seemingly vanished while slowly ascending. there were no trees blocking our view in this direction.\r\n\r\nwe were stunned. we spent a good bit of time trying to figure out what it was. i was frightened, i refused to let go of john as we were walking around our yard staring into the sky. john went inside briefly to check on muffins we had put into the oven right before we went out for a cigarette. after he returned, we continued to stare into the sky discussing what we thought it was for about 5 minutes. \r\n\r\ni walked to the west in our back yard, in the direction we saw it disappear. i was looking in the sky, it was clear, no clouds. i could see betelgeuse to the south west as well as sirius and jupiter. out of nowhere from the south i saw a string of three lights floating across the sky right in front of me heading north. they were higher than the first object we saw. i yelled out to john and he came rushing over my way and we were yelling about the three lights and how fast they were moving and what we were really seeing. the lights changed formation, into what i can only describe as a right triangle if you were to draw lines between the lights. the three lights continued to move very steadily in this formation, quicker than the first object, over the trees in the backyard to the north/north east. these lights were perfectly circular; they were illuminated just as the stars in the sky were. they were not as big as jupiter appeared but not as small as sirius either. as we were watching the lights move, john yelled to me to go inside and get his phone, i was in and out in 2 seconds, enough time to continue watching the lights move over the trees in my neighborhood to the north/northeast until i couldn't see them anymore. i could hear john messing around and talking to his phone, i wasn't paying a lot of attention to him after i handed him the phone. at this point i was almost to the front gate line of my side yard as i was trying to get a better glimpse of the lights moving through the neighborhood trees after it moved over our backyard. we watched it until it was barely out of sight when i ran in and grabbed the binoculars to try and catch a better view before they moved out of sight. i lost them over the trees and lost a couple binocular lens caps in my yard in the process.\r\n\r\njohn went back in quickly to check on the muffins and came back outside. i asked for his phone and called my mom. she didn't pick up but i left her a voice mail which is time stamped at 11:45 p.M. we stayed outside for about 10 more minutes, saw a couple of airplanes flying through, and shared a cigarette just talking and trying to process what we saw.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":63861,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.977443960508605,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03102015-0003","longitude":-82.43172644173731,"occurred":1425969000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1425980639000,"summary":"3 spheres appeared e to w;

hill (we live on mary hill)and immediately we both saw the bright lights and my husband slowed to a stop in the truck.  the lights were in the centre of our vision, directly down the road we were driving, could not miss them. (we both had witnessed a light phenomenon in mexico in the mayan riveria about 7 years ago....So we knew what we saw immediately wasn't right....)i was trying to look and fumble at my phone to try to get a video asap.  the lights were just over the top of the trees/houses there were 5 lights, four of them were hovering, moving extremely slowly in unison, three out front were in an arc pattern and then one centred at the back about 20 or 30 yards behind and between the orange/red lights (very very intense balls of light)was a much smaller rapidly and irratic moving white light between the lights.  it was moving extremely fast and i could not decifer a pattern in its movement, just rapid movement within the parameter of the other lights.  the entire group of lights were moving extremely slowly to the right...West direction it looked like they were right over eastern drive, the street we live on.  we were driving up western and were about 7 or 8 blocks away from eastern drive when we first spotted the lights and slowed and stopped the truck.  i tried my best to video on my phone but was shaking so badly my husband never took his eyes off the lights, and we started to drive quickly towards them about another block and just past lamprey they clean just disappeared.  just completely dissapered like the lights turned off, no rapid movement or anything and no sound..  we do get a lot of helicoptors as well as float planes in our area so we are very used to the noise and sound of aircraft.  i had my window down and there was only the sound of our vehicle.  we drove very fast up the last of the way to eastern and tried to see if we could see anything at all as eastern was more at the crest of the hill, and there was nothing....Crystal clear night, stars way up in the distance....I could clearly see orions belt, as well as a airplane way off in the distance...Absolutely no other lights.  we drove the two blocks to our house at the corner of eastern and elinor.  we ran inside and out to our deck that has a full view of the entire valley, and absolutely nothing.  i thought i saw one red orange light to the north west but it was over near sfu hill and disappeared quickly, and i wasnt' sure if my eyes were playing tricks.  we called our neighbor who also ran out and looked in the sky with us for about 5 minutes....Nothing at all. we were both very rattled by this and i had the shakes for the rest of the night...","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

sanger, ca and noticed an incredibly bright light behind them.  first thinking it was a car, or truck, even possibly an atv with their high beams on, realizing that the truck that was behind them turned off a side road, they then realized that this was something different.  my wife noticed it was roughly 3 feet or so above the road, and traveling pretty fast.  this object was circular in shape, but not a perfect circle..She said it wasnt like an egg either..She cant really describe the shape as it was a shape that she couldnt relate to..And this object was only about as big as a beach ball. in the middle of this object was as she described a incredibly brilliant white light,which did not light up any trees or the road below it, which was unusual, she said this was brighter than any high beam or led she has ever seen. she could notice some blinking lights on the bottom..Not sure of color or amount.  my mother in law said there might have been bluish lights on the bottom and said there were about 4 of them.  they said the object was only about 3 or 4 seconds behind them, my wife put it as if her mother would have hit her brakes that this thing would have hit them, it was that close!! from the point of first contact, they were only about 4 miles from home, it followed them the entire time until they came to a bridge which is where piedra comes to an end.  at this point they both noticed the object was nowhere to be seen.  they made the rest of the trip home which was only a couple of minuets.  both of them scared and excited about what they have just seen and trying to figure out what exactly it was.  once home, they got out of the car and noticed the object returned next to a vacant store right by the residence.  the object was clearly off the ground, and the store does not have any sort of lights on the outside, atleast any that work, but especially at the area this object was hovering. my wife then ran to the house to get her cellphone so she could take a picture.  she was only in the house for about 30 seconds or so and the object was still there so she snapped a couple pictures.  immediately called me, and at this point the object was gone, and no sign of its presence anywhere. this is not the first time this has happened, and couple of weeks prior a resident living in the same area witnessed the same type of object just not as upclose and personal.  over the last few years of living out in the foothills of sanger my wife and i have witnessed some interesting things, she would on multiple occasions see lights across the street from where she worked and it was not any sort of vehicle that she knows of, we have both witnessed what looked like a plane or helicopter flying over pretty low, but when we stopped and looked up this object made no noise and only had one maybe two lights on it and it was moving very slow, she also witnessed red lights that seem to dart off in a direction that no other aircraft could do...Thank you for reading our report of this strange encounter and the past encounters..My wife has no access to a computer so i put this report in on her behalf..I know my wife and she was very shaken up about this..The dark photo with the different lights is the one with the anomaly the light more towards the top does not belong there..The ones lower on the image are a neighbors little solar lights...The other pics are just showing the area the pic was looking at..Because the one with the object is too dark to see surrounding trees and the store this object was near..And my wife said that when she was taking the photo of the object that with the naked eye she could see some lights blinking on the bottom but with her phone camera she couldnt get a clear enough picture..Take what u want from this experience..It happened..I believe her...Thank u again","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

day because of it. it was fairly cold outside as well. the roads were really bad and there were basically no cars driving around at the time. it still wasn't completely dark outside as well. i had the door to my garage open (not the actual garage door, but a small door that you can use to get in the garage) and i was standing in the doorway halfway between outside and in the garage while i was smoking. \r\n\r\nright when i finished smoking, something caught my eye above the trees to my house. what i saw...I'll never forget for the rest of my life. i'll describe it as best as i can. it was undoubtedly an aircraft..I knew that instantly. however, it did not look like any known aircraft that exists. the first thing i saw was something coming out from above the trees, and the way it moved...It was impossible. it was right in front of me, yet it made no sound. for how big this thing was, and how close it was to me. it was as big as a fighter jet above my house. i could see it plainly. it was black, triangle shaped but not exactly a triangle. not only that, but it had white orbs built into the bottom of the aircraft. there were quite a few of these white orbs. it slowly moved in a straight line when i saw it, it moved so slow...With no propulsion..Like it was hovering. there were no lights on it either. it shifted to the right a little to reveal more white orbs attached to the bottom of it. again, these orbs were not lit up. it had to have something to do with it being able to move like it did. \r\n\r\nthe whole thing lasted about 10 seconds before i turn around and ran back into my garage, tripped over a push mower, and ran back through a door in my garage that connects to my room, and locked the door behind me. i have never been so scared in my entire life. nothing in my entire life have a seen anything that comes close to what i saw that night. it changed my life. my entire life culminated into a single moment wouldn't be as significant as what i saw. i was crying out of fear and confusion. i didn't go back outside for the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nbefore this event, i always considered ufo's to be a possibility, but i never considered them to be a reality. until now. there is no doubt in my mind that what i saw was real. i don't know if this was a government entity or otherwise. all i know is that it was a highly advanced aircraft, with technology that we couldn't even comprehend. it fairly easy to make that assumption from what i saw.\r\n\r\ni have no reason to lie about this. i can't sleep at night now, and i am afraid for my life. i am almost positive that it saw me, because of my proximity to it. this happened only days ago, and i am still scared to go outside now at night. i've never been like this before. it is like seeing a ghost; something unreal that you can't explain. \r\n\r\ni have so many questions about what i saw, but no answers. that's the scariest part. i hope that my story gets out there, because i want people to know that these things, whatever they are, are out there. i have included a drawing that i did about 1 minute after this happened. it is not completely accurate because was symmetrical designs on both sides of it, but it is the best i can do. i never really got a good look at the back of it either. thank you so much for reading about what happened to me.","distance":"21-100

11:15-11:30pm i saw something in the air in the corner of my eye so i looked out my window from where i was sitting on my couch. \r\n\r\ni immediately recognized that the aircraft was unique. it was a perfect triangle shape with all three edges straight. i immediately got up, stood on the other couch and looked out the window. the aircraft was traveling relatively slowly and at a low altitude. i was able to see the aircraft itself, not just the lights. i called for my fiance, who was sitting on the other couch and did not see it when it passed by the window. she jumped up onto the couch with me and watched it as it flew off. by the time she saw it, it was father away and hard for her to see anything except for the triangle lights. \r\n\r\ni have been thinking back to what i saw all day and trying to remember more details about it, but i can't remember certain details with absolute certainty so i left them out. i believe that the lights on the aircraft were two of the same color and one a different color, but i cannot remember with certainty what colors they were, so i am not including that information. i cannot remember if they were pulsating or blinking. \r\n\r\ni cannot remember with certainty the color of the craft but it appeared almost greyish. i remember seeing the texture on the bottom of the craft but cannot remember much about it. from the time i saw it to the time it was flying off in the distance was a matter of seconds. the time that i was able to see it low and detailed was perhaps 3 seconds. i was somewhat in awe and wish i had my camera and big zoom lens on hand when this happened. the aircraft seemed to be flying low and appeared to be large, but not huge. if i had to guess, it was somewhat smaller than a commercial airplane, but bigger than a small cesna airplane. based on what i perceived its elevation to be, i would estimate the aircraft was between 20-50 feet long, maybe larger as it was difficult to tell just how low it was.\r\n\r\nfollowing the sighting, perhaps ten seconds later i heard two or three banging sounds coming from outside my window in the direction the aircraft was flying. i cannot say if they were
