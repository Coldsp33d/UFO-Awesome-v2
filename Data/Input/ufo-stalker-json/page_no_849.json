my husband's sleeping behavior involved him thrashing his arms so violently during his sleep that i had to sleep in the spare bedroom for safety, especially since i was pregnant.  there were two

in the sky at about the same location. the light was about the size and intensity of a single semi trailer brake light is at about 200 yards. there was only a single light and as i drove nearer towards it i could see that the rise of the light per my distance and speed would have put the light to the west of my house by about 300 yards, and about 400 feet high from the ground. i glanced in my jeep to see if the light was a reflection from something in the jeep, there was nothing that would emit a light similar to that in the sky, i looked back up to see the light and it was gone. total duration of my experience was about 1 minuite.  when i went to work the next day, i described my experience with a coworker, then he described the same light in the sky that he saw about 20 years earlier in the same place from a different viewing place. whatever this (these) lights are, they reappear. \r\n           mchenry had an earthquake a few years ago and i watched the flashing earthquake lights for about 2 years.  the earthquake lights were like seeing the flash from a fire truck light bar from 2 miles and over a hill. these lights started out with just one here and there once and a while and escalated to the point that the whole southern horizon was constantly flashing every night as well as once in a while  i would receive a shock and see a bright flash of light, day or night, eyes open or closed would see these flashes. after the earthquake all the flashes and shocks stopped immediately.  what we have seen in the sky \"ain't no quake lights\"; been there, done

enough, about 15 minutes later, as we were headed north on 127, we could see that strange green color glowing from behind some foothills about 1/2 mile to the east of us.  i pulled over to the side of the road, stopped, got out of my suburban, and walked to the rear of the vehicle.  my 8-month old black lab, max, was barking and raising all kinds of hell in the rear of the vehicle, because he could see and possibly hear the object as well.  as for me, there was no sound that i could detect, possibly because of the distance involved. the object appeared to be hovering maybe 15-20 ft. above the ground, slowly moving forward in a northerly direction.  it would appear and disappear behind a series of foothills .  the phosphorous green glow was more apparent when the object was out of view behind a foothill.  when the object came back into view it appeared to be a disk shaped craft and if you drew a lateral line across the middle of it, the whole top half looked like a glass dome.  inside the dome were hundreds if not thousands of very tiny, multicolored lights.  reminded me of christmas tree lights, red, white, green, blinking very fast. i would guess the craft was 30-50ft. in diameter with no visible landing gear, and no external lights.  all the lights seemed to come from inside the dome, with the whole craft surrounded by that eerie green glow. i saw no occupants, and it never landed.  i viewed it for perhaps 3-5 minutes, and at my wife's insistence got back in my vehicle and drove away. i would guess that this occurred a few miles south of the dumont sand dune area on 127.  too bad i wasn't alone, or i would have went for a closer look.  no camera available, and no one else passed us by.  don't know why i waited so long to report this, but of all the ufo stuff i've seen on tv and elsewhere, i've never seen anything that remotely resembled this.  just wondering if you have.

completely still, and from my perspective, about 3 feet above the roof peek of my neighbor's house which is east of my house at a distance of approximately 300 feet.  there was absolutely no sound coming from the direction of this object. i quickly returned to my bedroom to get my glasses and then went right back to my living room. approximately 30 seconds later it started to move very slowly to the right. as soon as it started to move something blinked sequentially 3 times on the right side of the orb.  it continued moving to the right but as soon as the orb passed the tree-line i lost sight of it. as this event was transpiring i was very interested and not scared at all. i was so excited to be seeing something so abnormal and unusual. there is no way to know how long this object

ontario from quebec watching tv at 7:30pm.  i have a huge picture window overlooking quebec and the river and out of the corner of my eye i saw something high in the sky over quebec in the northwest.  i turned my head to have a better look and it looked, at first, like a bright white star.  something about it was different though and then i realized that it was staying in place but it seemed to have movement.\r\n\r\ni went over to the window to get a better look and it was then that i noticed it was moving in a sort of hyper way - flashing in this bright white light but around it were red lights too that throbbed and actually looked like they were circling the white object but on it - not separate from it.  also i noticed a couple of what i can only describe of arm like objects that seemed to appear at the sides of the object -right and left - and then they seemed to go back down then up or they could have been attached i don't know, too far away.  unfortunately i didn't have binoculars so specifics were limited.\r\n\r\ni noticed that the object stayed where it was for almost an hour and then it started to move downwards a bit - almost like falling but slower and not too far down then it went back up to where it was and it kept doing this little bobbing kind of thing a few times.  now it was lower than when i first saw it.  all this time it was flashing and changing shape it seemed but since it was a star-like shape it was hard to see the shapes exactly but it grew then shrunk so i assumed it was changing shape in some manner.  the red lights continued to pulsate or spin around the white light.  the 'arms' would appear over and over but there weren't as many appearances of them as there was in the beginning.\r\n\r\nthis stage continued for a few minutes and then it started to come down a little more but still high above the horizon of quebec (gatineau) but this time it obviously was headed due north into quebec and it seemed to have turned a total red color - no sign of the white light now.  \r\n\r\ni watched the red object continue north into quebec until it was just a little pinprick of red light and then it was gone - too small to see or maybe it disappeared - don't know.  that stage of it heading north and changing to just red lasted only about a half hour.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound from it at any time but i was far away but i didn't hear anything from where i was.\r\n\r\nmy feelings were several.  at first i was stunned to see it moving but then it was just very interesting, especially when i saw the red lights going around and the 'arms' jutting out from the sides of the white object.  the dipping up and down were actually kind of comical - almost like dancing or playing.  i wasn't scared because i had seen another sighting of 2 orange balls over pretty much the same area of quebec a couple of years ago and that sighting was even more spectacular than this one so i know something is going on over there in that general area so i guess that is why i wasn't shocked at this sighting.  i was really freaked out the first time a couple of years ago because that one was very dramatic with 2 of the objects shooting out actual beams that hit the ground in quebec and you could hear booms when they hit.  i had a witness with me at that time so she saw and heard that too.  i think i sent that report to mufon at that time, i think i did.\r\n\r\nthis incident was followed the next day march 6, 2015 about the same time of night by a sighting of a similar bright white light in the same area but it was definitely just a star because it did nothing and so i know that what i saw on the 5th was a ufo because it started out similar but changed immediately to much more.\r\n\r\nthat's about it.  i sent the report to ufo hunters as well for their info too in case they have similar sightings in their data bases too.\r\n\r\nhope this helps with your sightings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

this is hard for me to type because of all the horrifying experiences my mother suffered through with what the greys did to her pretty much her entire childhood through her adult life until her death 12 years ago. \r\n\r\nbut my impression of the craft and it's possible occupants was friendly even childlike!! the way the craft was moving in the sky was like it was up there simply enjoying the light from the setting sun. it was \"playing\" in the light! i was just the only person i know to have actually noticed it up there! it appeared as a plane without wings but had that triangle on the top of it like our regular planes do. then it kinda looked and moved like a bird with in depth banking and circling maneuvers. then when i hit a stage of acceptance that it was nothing conventional or biological that i was looking at it seemed to notice i was tracking it with my eyes. just when my mind was wrapped around the fact that omg this is really happening and it's really up there i need a better look at it let me pull out my phone it showed itself to me! it's triangular shape the three white bright unblinking lights on what i assumed was the bottom of it the craft was silver and transparent at the same time and i saw the haze around its entirety like some sort of invisible energy field that's my minds best guess. or else it was its \"aura\" because remember i see auras as a normal part of my hybrid existence! it seemed to be saying hi there human so you noticed us up here well take a gander and then it either blended itself back into the sky or popped out of this dimension because i did not see it speed off. \r\n\r\nfrom the nature of its actions my heart is telling me either it's another species of extra dimensional being or it was humans piloting that craft. whatever or whoever it was friendly, playful, loving the light of the sun, and my extra sensory perception tells me it was shocked to have been noticed but pleasantly surprised. i was never scared while watching it and it obviously could morph into other appearances from looking like a wingless 747 to a bird to what it presented to me. after this experience no i don't want to be taken in their craft or really ever meet them but i sensed good in it and that alone has my mind reeling!! because my previous impression based on my mother's experiences was nothing but hatred for them well the grey's specifically. \r\n\r\nnow \"knowing\" that their are other explorers out there who are not interested in harming or scaring us my views are changing.\r\n\r\nthese other beings could be as vast and different from each other as we humans are from each other. perhaps the aggressive,  intrusive, harmful beings have their own agendas. then there are other beings who welcome our diversity and natural curiosity not with abduction and invasive actions to our persons but with a warm hello pleased to meet you and we see you as you see us!! so either explorers from somewhere else have seen me and now have a gentler impression of humanity too as i have a gentler view of them&#10084;&#65039; perhaps it really is one love throughout the universes!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":63815,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.08851950507956,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03082015-0010","longitude":-79.76428957835911,"occurred":1425694620000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1425835705000,"summary":"It started out looking like a wingless 747 then changed shape to a large black bird and then into a triangle shaped silver and transparent craft. there were no windows seen.","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"27401","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Greensboro, North Carolina","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:52371"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Beverly Hills","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at my my aunt and uncles house my cousins lee and michelle and my sister were in the front yard i was laying on the grass looking straight up the sky was very clear i saw to bright white lights one stationary and one moving across the sky. from the one moving came a smaller red light that went over to the stationary light and the a few seconds later it returned to the moving light. i remember even at nine i thought it was most likely some high tech that was secret because i was way into all that i knew and could identify them all selfridge afb was only thirty miles to the east. my father was a law enforcement professional also an air raid warden and then fallout officer we retrieved a couple of weather balloons so i knew about things even then. ten years later i had a closer contact.
