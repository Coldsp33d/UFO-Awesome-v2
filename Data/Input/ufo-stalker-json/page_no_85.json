in the middle of the triangle, where the \"kids\" were being silly. the lights went off then came back on diagonal. then they went off and we didn't see those orange ones again. we watched for awhile and the more we looked around the more we saw so many tiny jet lines ones that were going on form's of up and down and fast and slow...No direct pattern. seemed like the missionary 2 flashed their lights 4 times as they were flying. sometimes they went fast, sometimes slower, but sometimes the last flash of the 4 they accelerated. \r\nso at that point i had to take my son home to bed. he saw everything i did. and that means the world to me knowing my past where i was all by myself. he's been chosen too which, i think, is cool. \r\nso the area is the plainfield, wi area for the triangle part, then the other part was south part of wisconsin rapids, wi. \r\nthis is my 3rd event this year, just within them last few months. on top of that i was abducted/controlled twice. once for a few hours straight. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":88575,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.31408383575111,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12062017-0001","longitude":-89.81719361682376,"occurred":1512506700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1512525978000,"summary":"2nd time seen, 3 big orange ball lights, then numerous random flight planes, 2 different areas in 5 miles radius","tags":["triangle","ufo","lights","flash"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1512699048089,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"54494","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7510"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Westwold ","country":"CA","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My family and i were travelling on highway 97 just outside of westwold nearing monte lake. we were travelling a bit faster than we should have and i first had thought we were being pulled over but soon realized it was not what we expected. i had slowed down to around 50 kph pretty quick as i figured i was going to get pulled over but all of us in the vehicle observed what seemed to be like very slow pulsating red, blue and orange lights that almost dulled themselves down to a low beam to a bright light. we observed what seemed to be a dark objet near the passenger front section of visible window area. we had the speakers in our vehicle make a awful screeching noise and weird vocals that were not like anything i have ever heard. i then slowed right down to almost a rolling stop on the highway and our electrical in the vehicle started doing the funky chicken and what seemed to be like shorting out. i wanted to pull over and get out or at least pull a u turn and investigate but with screaming kids and them begging me to keep driving, felt it was best to continue. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":88574,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-12052017-0013","longitude":null,"occurred":1512423000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"British Columbia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1512513875000,"summary":"Breif and witnessed by my wife and 2 sons. pulsating glowing lights and a horrible screaming coming from the speakers and all electrical in the vehicle affected.

Unknown","city":"Columbia","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting on my couch after letting my dog into the backyard. i heard what seemed to be a low flying plane above. however there was a sort of humming. the noise i observed grew louder as i assumed it was getting closer to my house. i went into my backyard to see what the sound was. i noticed to the ne what looked like a plane dropping in altitude. i expected to hear a crash or see an explosion. the plane had passed through my line of sight and i could no longer view it. i stayed outside for a little longer to smoke a cigarette. after a few minutes i noticed what looked like a smoke trail off to my left (n.) at first i thought that the smoke i was observing may have been coming from my cigarette. i said \"what is that?\" however once i focused my gaze on the smoke trail, i realized how far the smoke was from me. it was too far to have been my cigarette smoke and i realized that it was moving from my left to my right (s.) i asked again, \"what is that??\" at this point i had moved away from my house to get a better look at this \"smoke trail.\" this is when i could visibly make out its shape and realized how fast it was moving. the object was like covered in a reflective material that almost made it transparent/seethrough. the object was shaped like a boomerang and was massive in size. i couldn't make out the side of the object very well, however i could easily see that whatever it was, that it had a sort of cockpit. the cockpit was large and almost egg shaped, round in shape. the nose of the object came to a corner almost a degree angle. as the object passed by i heard a humming, and felt a static like presence. all the neighborhood dogs were barking (which is unusual, they are normally very quite.) there was a distorted cloudly like smog that surrounded the vehicle/object. there was also a sort of trail left by the object as it continued to move. i noticed that there were multiple aircraft, possibly planes or jets following this object (from a distance.) i belive that they were following/investigating its presence also. the transformer (green electrical box) in my yard started to make odd noises, as if it was being affected by this vehicles presence. the object seemed to be descending in altitude and i am assuming it was coming down for a landing. soon though the object had passed my line of sight and was now hidden by the trees that blocked my sight. i could no longer see the object. still in disbelief i kept looking around in the sky to catch a glimpse of anything. i wanted to see if more things like this would pass by, or if more jets/planes would be showing up. i heard noises off in the distance that i cant quite explain. some humming, a distant hiss, and what sounded sort of like a horn, and some metallic sounds. i retreated back into my house with my dog and grabbed my revolver. (just in case.) i had a slight headache within 30 minutes after observing this object. i honestly dont know what i just witnessed but i assure you this is real. whatever it was, it wasnt manmade. it was massive, larger than any aircraft that i've ever seen. it was bigger than an aircraft carrier for sure. everything seems to have settled down and returned to normal. im not sure if i am the only one who noticed this but i find it impossible that something that large could have glided by undetected. somebody else must have seen this object, or atleast heard the weird noises it made as it passed by. i do live near a highway and close to many conservation areas, parks, rivers, and there is an airport about 20 minutes or so away from my house. i know that wasnt an airplane. that wasnt a jet. i just dont know what it was. i couldnt get a picture of it, as it didnt appear on the camera when i tried. it was see through.

dishes away, and there was this really bright light outside my window-it wasn't *right* outside my window- location-wise, it was over the apartment complex across from my window, and behind it distance-wise. it was in that area, and it was this really, really bright, steady light, it wasn't pulsing or flashing, there wasn't any red lights with it like a plane would have, and it was completely still. i noticed it right when i came into my room because it was so bright, it stood out against the skyline. for a second there i was like \"wait, did they have like a radio station there or something that i missed?\". i know radio stations/telephone towers aren't that color, and they flash, and it looked bigger than that, but i thought maybe it was something like that because it was so bright, and because it wasn't moving at first i thought that it was man-made. i could see the rays of light emanating from around it. but it was just sort of a steady, bright light for a second, and it stayed like that for a couple seconds but then afterwards it just sort of gradually started to dim until it was completely gone. there wasn't any other sort of flashing, and it stayed in the exact same spot the entire time- it wasn't moving or anything. when that first cycle happened i was like \"wait what, wait what?\" the whole time, i was just sort of like whispering to myself because i didn't know what i was seeing. but then a few seconds later it sort of reappeared? i'm guessing that it was the same thing because it was that same bright, white light. it didn't have any flashing effects or anything, it was just white light, and it seemed a lot dimmer or further away this time. i think it was just dimmer, i think it was probably about the same distance from me, and it was a bit towards the right, so it was heading towards the tree line, and it was sort of bobbing up and down. it sort of looked like it was in the ocean, almost? it was moving in a very fluid path, and there didn't seem to be any sort of rhyme or reason to how it was moving. so i started trying to get my phone out at that point, but it was too dim for it to pick it up, because the video recorder on it isn't the greatest. it was too grainy and dark to see anything and by the time i actually had it out it was already in the tree line. and like, i could still see it with my eyes, but my phone wasn't picking it up. i could see the light being covered up behind the parts of the sky with trees, it was definitely an object in the distance, not a reflection. so it bobbed around for a few seconds until it either turned its lights off again, or just disappeared behind the tree line. i stayed after a few minutes to try and see if i could see it again, but i didn't. it was dusk at the time and the only clouds in the sky were a few contrails. after i saw it i was pretty shaken, but i made a recording of me recounting what i saw pretty much immediately after it happened, and the majority of this text comes from that directly (i don't know how to upload that to my computer though). after that i made a quick sketch (included). it was hard for me to focus on anything and my heart was racing, but i think that was less \"supernatural abilities\" and more just me freaking out. it was weird for sure.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

this for a friend!\r\n\r\nmy friend told me about a sighting he and his friends had in my town about 20 years ago or such here very near where i live. they were about 8-10 years of age, sliding down a hill near a smallish but dense forest during winter time at the evening.\r\nsuddenly they apparently saw a strange light coming from behind the hill and went to investigate. they go to about 3 meters away from the red-ish or orange-ish pulsating object and it was about 1 meter in diameter if i recall him telling right. also it was howering about 1 meter from the ground. they got scared and all of them ran home and tried explaining it to their parents who naturally didn't believe them. after years of convincing his parents they just said it was propably a meteor or something, anyway they went back a few weeks later (too scared to go earlier)...\r\nthe trees around the spot where they saw it had apparently burned their tree bark just 1m from the ground from about the length of the sphere they saw. but also the snow below the place had melted away. he said nothing grew on the spot for about a decade.\r\nhe showed me the spot about a month ago but it was too dark to properly see anything, i might go check it out again on daylight when i have the time. though the burn marks might've faded. few trees were cut around the spot thought they were small trees and we wondered why would anyone cut them, since they were kind of young trees and for firewood there woud've been much better trees.\r\nadditional information and question:\r\nhe told me that the object did not make any sound. he and his friends still believe they saw a real alien spacecraft, i forgot to ask how many of them were there.\r\n\r\nhere are the google maps coordinates (about 5 meter ish marginal error in

our story, its comprised of several strange things. my friend lets me use her computer to report this event.\r\n i was asked by a personal acquaint (daryl) to write my story and submit it to you, we would like to stay completely anonymous and we mean completely, as i fear the reprisal and ridicule from my neighbors and friends. we were asleep when we were awakened around 10:30 pm we noticed a bright red-orange light outside shining through the window, waking richard and believing it was an emergency vehicle, we got dressed went outside and observed a pulsating red-orange light in the trees approximately 100 yards from our home near the creek. we were unable to see the source that was creating the anomaly, there was no sound just a pulsing light within the trees. at first, we thought someone had gotten hurt and an ambulance or some sort of emergency vehicle was in the tree line, oddly there was no sound, no talking or radio chatter, no bugs, no birds. we started walking towards the light and a feeling of someone or something came over us as if we were being watched or someone watching you, we felt very uncomfortable and frighten to continue towards the light, we walked maybe 10 feet from our home and richard said we need to return to the house get the camera and snap some pictures, once we returned to our home we grabbed our camera and went back outside it took 10 seconds to get our camera and go back out side, just at that moment, there was a bright flash of light, and the light was gone, complete silence no noise of a motor, like a scooter or any aircraft type vehicle. we attempted to rationalize what we had just witnessed, both of us said it was possibly a game warden on a 4 wheel scooter going down into the bluff, so we went back to bed.\r\nonce settled back to bed we heard a loud bang in the garbage area, both of us already feeling a bit unsettled richard looked out the window and noticed a brown figure sanding digging in the garbage, we have a large dumpster with a lid that closes and latches, richard and i jumping back out of bed rushed to the window to see what it could be, a possible bear looking for a meal, the figure was standing on two feet lid open and reaching in the dumpster with the other arm. we were too frightened to go outside, if it was a bear, it's hungry, and possibly feeding young cubs. we attempted to take a picture through the window and only got a flashback in the camera, we noticed that the bear was startled when the light from the camera flashed and it moved away from the dumpster area. about 20 minutes later we heard a loud bang outside, we rushed to the window and noticed that the dumpster is now on laying on its side and dumped, richard decided to go outside with a bear banger to scare the bear away from the garbage, i followed him out the door but saw nothing at the dumpster area other then garbage, we set off the bear banger, off to the distance in the tree line where the light had been observed just moments ago we heard an awful scream, not a human scream but an animal scream, off in the distance stood a very large figure with red glowing eyes looking at us, it was extremely frightening and was very large, the intense figure moved in to the tree line and disappeared quickly, this was no bear, it was a human like figure with extraordinary large proportions, extremely broad at the shoulders. we moved as fast as we could to our home and locked the door, we called the game warden and they said it was possibly a bear, just stay inside and they will send someone out tomorrow, after explaining to them the extraordinary evening we have had they didn’t want to send a warden out to help, you could hear the condescending attitude in the phone conversation, we know this was no bear, we believe we witnessed a ufo and a bigfoot all in one evening, it walked and stood there looking at us. we contacted some researchers out of sacramento to investigate the bigfoot sighting and the lead founder daryl gave me your website information to report the ufo. once again we are very worried about reprisal and ridicule so please just use what i have said and hope this helps in your search for ufo's. the pictures i have included are the pictures we took of the tree line and dumpster.\r\n\r\nrespectfully \r\nchristine and richard aldred","distance":"101-500

morning) and felt like there was something in my room. my daughter was sleeping in my bed with me and i hid us both under the blanket. she stayed asleep the whole night, including during this visitation. i was under the blanket when i suddenly felt a finger press down on my forehead between my eyes. it wasn't a small finger, it was as if my dad (a large man) was pressing his finger between my eyes. i started to panic and reluctantly came out of the blanket to grab my cell phone beside my bed and call my mom (when there's something scary in your room at night and you're half asleep, what's your first reaction? \"mom!\"). when i peeked out of my blanket, i saw something in front of me. i could tell that there was something in front of me, but it looked like a mirage. i could see through it, but i could tell there was something there. i started panicking even more. i told myself that i was seeing things and reached my hand out to prove that there was nothing there. i was wrong, and my grabbed onto what felt like a thin arm. that really freaked me out, so i started frantically grabbing for my phone but it was dead and wouldn't turn back on. it was on the charger so this made no sense at all. suddenly i was back into a dream state and a character from a tv show that i enjoy was standing in front of my trying to calm me down, but i felt like it was a being just appearing as something i am comfortable with. then i was back asleep and having a dream that my daughter and i were on a beach and i looked down into a tide-pool on the beach and saw some red and blue tigers eye stones, so i picked them up and put them in my pocket. when i woke up again, i checked my phone and it was turned on and the time was 4am. my migraine was completely gone. the next day, i felt a bit off. maybe a little traumatized, but the truth is that it was not scary. i didn't feel threatened or hurt, it just frightened me to wake up from a dream to that happening. i'm not sure how to explain it but as soon as the finger touched my forehead, i saw in my mind's eye that it was a long grey finger. so, i believe it was a grey that visited me.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":88549,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.0115592,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12042017-0007","longitude":-80.2378734,"occurred":1512100800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"South

residence in ponce inlet, florida.  i accessed the beach from the parking lot that feeds from ocean view avenue along south atlantic avenue.   i was actually in conversation on my cell phone.  the view of the ocean with a full moon was spectacular to say the least, so i put my friend on speaker while accessing my camera.  i took 3 photos while continuing my conversation.   the first shot was a vertical one.  the 2nd and 3rd were horizontal.  there is a noticeable beach sign in the pictures.   by the time i took the 3rd, you can see the perspective has changed from the first two because i was walking and snapping at the same time.  \r\n\r\nit wasn't until i got home and looked at the photos were i noticed something peculiar.  in the first shot, i immediately thought it was ruined due to some kind of blemish (the unidentified light below the moon) and quickly moved to the second image to perhaps send this out to a friend or two.  because i liked the vertical style of the first shot, i began using my phone's editing feature to re-crop the 2nd one when i noticed again what appeared to be a blemish but this time, it was on the horizon.  (only seconds after the first shot.) in checking the 3rd image there was no \"blemish.\" \r\n\r\nupon further examination of the photos, i realized that the very dramatic and heavy clouds were obviously blocking starlight.  as anyone can see, the moon is barely bursting through.  and given that i didn't use a flash, it seems that the orbs present in the first 2 photos were indeed in front of the cloud cover.  i ruled out any meteor because there is no tail at all.  and the color of the orb/orbs is the same.  as for a plane or helicopter, the timing doesn't make sense nor does the type of light.  \r\n\r\ni then tweaked the photos more in my phone app and whatever it is i captured looks to be in the same sky as the moon.  additionally, i was able to pull out a second orb in the first photo but i didn't save it.  i still cannot replicate what i did.  but i would welcome anyone to tweak the 1st original and you may get lucky and see another orb down and to the left of the obvious one.  \r\n\r\nso here, i'm including a total of 5 photos.  the first 3 originals.  and then the first 2 tweaked to highlight whatever this/these lights are.
