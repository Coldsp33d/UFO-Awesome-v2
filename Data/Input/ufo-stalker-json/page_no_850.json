amorphous cloud-like form moving at constant rate from sw to nw. thought it was smoke cloud or flying dedris.  binoculars revealed a huge seemingly solid craft with very distinct rows of dim rectangular windows/lights that were part of the craft, not separate objects. they revealed a distinct triangular craft moving totally silent. i used to fly a small plane and was in the military and have some perspective as to distance,elevation and relative size. the thing was stunningly and clearly a craft. it seemed to be 300 to 400 ft wide at 3000 to 5000 ft high moving at 175 to 200 mph.  total observation about 6 t0 10 seconds as it continued over my roofline and out of sight. i have never seen anything like a ufo or strang object before. this is without question ,at least for me, absolute proof that intelligently designed  and operated craft that have no known explanation are real. i was stunned at the clarity and certainty of this object and the entire event. i do not use drugs or alcohol , am in excellent healty, own a small business and am very social. the ramifications of this experience are sure to be interesting for the rest of my life.","distance":"Over One

towards columbus, and took the outer belt, 270 s. to go to the counseling center where i work. as we were driving, i was sitting in the passenger seat, looking at the front window, i looked up into the sky, and off to my left at about the 11 o'clock position, i noticed a black shiny disc hovering up in the sky. the disc was circular nature, and had a body which is black that had a whitish outline around it. this could have been from the sun, and i am not sure, but this makes the most sense to me. i guesstimate that the craft was between 250 and 350 feet long and approximately 1/3 of that measurement, in height.\r\n\r\n        i look down to pick up my phone so that i can shoot a picture, and when i looked up, the craft had in that small of time, moved to a position that i estimate to be about 10 to 15 miles away, and was positioned in what i believe to be the front of a cloud. i snapped 2 pictures, and when i looked up to take a third, it was gone. if you look at the pictures you will see definitive white beam of light, coming down from the craft, which appears as a small circular shaped object behind the front of the cloud. i took 2 more pictures to show both the traveling motion of the car that i was in, and the change in scenery along the highway, by which you can gauge distance travelled.\r\n\r\nwater marked pictures, soon to

called over by 4-5 colleagues who were watching something out of the east wing window in the operations centre. they pointed to about 20 silver orbs - reflective like chrome ball bearings floating across our view in a steady formation. the majority of these continued on their journey - 2 of these stayed back and performed some incredible aerobatics shooting vertically through the cloud layer (which was quite low but visibility was otherwise crystal clear) - the sun was still setting and the sunset was reflecting on the under side of these objects. their manouevres were totally off the scale as in their agility. i have been to may air shows and never seen any conventional plane perform such darting aerobatics. if a pilot had been on board these objects, they would have certainly been killed due to the inertia and g-force. i could only say that who ever- or what ever was controlling or flying these orbs, was having a bit of a good time judging by how \"playful\" their aerobatics were -it was almost like a game of cat and mouse. definitely intellignetly controlled - and someone with a personality! after 10-15 minutes, these few objects then continued in their journey in the same direction of their comrades. i happened to have the phone number of the ministry of defence in whitehall - uk - and reported the sighting. they in turn reported it to the police force in brierley hill (j1 group) who then passed on the details of the report to the local newspapers - it made front page news the next day. when i came back in the next day for may shift, my colleagues said that the phones had gone mad with ufo groups and researchers who wanted to speak to me. the newsapapers wanted to speak to me as well and took my statement - none of my colleagues would speak to them as they were afraid of ridicule.\r\ni still have to newspaper cutting for that date. i feel so lucky to have seen probably the largest sighting in the u.K. of these objects. obviously in 1997 there was no internet - since then, i can totally tie this sighting to exactly the same as those sightings in mexico where these orbs seem to be seen most often. the fact that this sighting ties in with the mexican ones - before the age of the internet says a lot - yes the mexican people can be quite superstitious but that doesn't change the facts. the fact that i saw the sunset on the underside of these objects means that they were solid and they were there! - aside from us at the aa, there was only one other official report and that was from someone who was walking at the same time over the clent hills - 3 miles away - the clent hills has an elevation of 1000 ft above sea level. so. what do you think. i will stand by my statement for the rest of my life and would gladly be interviewed by anyone and stand my ground to say that what i and my colleagues saw was true.

this was not consistent with the behavior of a normal aircraft. over the course of five minutes, it got closer and it was pretty low to the ground, however, not low enough to make out a shape. it was very, very bright and moving very slowly still. i called my husband to come look after it had moved closer and lower, so from this point on, he witnessed what i did. the light became brighter then would fade a little, then became a random quick flashing. i noticed red and blue lights flashing in with the white at times, but the main color was bright white. it looked as if it had a tail, but it wasn't moving quickly enough for it to be anything burning behind it, it had to be light reflecting off of something that made up the structure of the object. it was very cold outside, so after about 20 minutes of watching it hover outside, i came in and could see it outside my window. over a course of five minutes, the light gradually got dimmer, then completely disappeared. i went outside and walked around my backyard to be sure it didn't just move somewhere else, but it was gone. i would have tried to get a picture or video but mmy phone isn't the greatest and with all the streetlights it wouldn't have turned out very well anyway.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":63783,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.2815271,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03062015-0025","longitude":-85.7282247,"occurred":1425701700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1425706204000,"summary":"Thought was a star or planet, then slow moving bright flashing light","tags":["video","lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"47130","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Jeffersonville, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:53039"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Richmond","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Out filming a bright star, think it was venus in the west.When i saw this object..Moveing underneath the star headed south west underneath..Unknown object, no sound.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":63782,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.8545586,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03062015-0024","longitude":-84.3221418,"occurred":1425011400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1425702334000,"summary":"Iam ufo watcher..I film all unknown objects i see in sky","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/63782_submitter_file1__1015606.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/63782_submitter_file2__1015491.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/63782_submitter_file3__1015487.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/63782_submitter_file4__1015498.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/63782_submitter_file5__1015499.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"40475","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7,"locationName":"Richmond, Kentucky","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:53040"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Arlington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was walking back from taking the garbage out and saw what looked like a shooting star.  the shooting star/object was moving west away from washington dc, as it was moving west it exploded into two pieces.  it looked like a blue flame that split into two.  half of it went west and the other half moved east and disintegrated.  at that moment i thought it was pretty cool that i saw a shooting star but then thought i never seen a shooting star explode like that.  i then proceeded to look up at the sky and about a minute after i saw the explosion, i looked up and saw what looked like a very big star.  i would say it was comparable to the size of the north star.  the star got bigger and then started to ascend upward and disappeared.  now i am an educated man and have seen dozens of shooting stars but never saw a shooting star explode and then see object in the sky move closer to earth and then ascend upward and out of our atmosphere.  pretty crazy but pretty exciting as well.

approximately 2233 hours.\r\nnorth valleys, reno-stead, nev.; highway 395\r\n\r\nshortly leaving the house to go to work that evening upon getting onto the south bound lane of highway 395 to head towards reno, it was like every other night and routine. there was no clouds with in the sky, and the moon was behind peavine mountain. \r\n\r\nin the far distance, over the hills leading east past sparks, in the direction going towards elko there was a bright light, at first thinking it was a brighter than normal star. after a few seconds it grew brighter and was coming closer; traveling west bound in the sky (upper atmosphere); changing my mind and now thinking is was a meteor coming into atmosphere and passing over the region, me and my wife went to slow down and pull the car over to the side of the road to watch it. \r\n\r\nas it came closer and closer rather quickly, we noticed there was other objects following it, we at first passed it off as debris falling off. which is where the events went from watching a rare event to a once in a life time occurrence that happened very fast and as soon as it started it was over. the object swooped to the left as if it was doing a barrel roll to dodge something, then roughly over the highway about 100-150 yards away from us and other vehicles the object in question appeared to have made an abrupt stop in the air approximately 600 feet above the ground and made a very extreme and hard turn to head north east (ne); this is where i noticed that this object, at this time was triangular shape, with a panel design what may have been the base (underbelly) with a strange design. \r\n\r\nlarge in size and chrome and grey coloring as well with a hex-base rear with three brightly glowing yellowish-orange orbs that left a bright trail of the same color that faded into white. as the object was making a very deep and low based (beyond baritone) hum, made the sharp left turn and directed the front into an angle, with what appeared to have ejected a spherical object from side; roughly the size of a small car (volkswagen beetle). the secondary object directly after being what seemed ejected out headed south west and gained altitude very quickly leaving a small vapor trail, with unknown jets flying overhead above the highway.\r\n\r\nthe main object at this point was now gaining altitude and appearing over the hills between lemmon valley and golden valley. suddenly without warning the object exploded in the sky. a very extremely bright explosion which sounded like a very deep “boom” like thunder, as well it caused the sky to go from the traditional midnight blue and stars twinkling in the sky to a bright blue, and caused the area to light up very briefly; giving the impression that just a selected area was being viewed like it was around 0700 hours in the morning. appearing shortly after the explosion seems to be two very dark colored / black apache style attack helicopters and a dark colored smaller helicopter passed by overhead coming south heading north east, seeming low headed towards their direction. \r\n\r\nduring these events it seemed that there was difficulties with phones, cameras and radios within the area, causing a brief power bump for many. i contacted multiple radio stations to see if they obtained reports of it, as well local law enforcement – all of which detailed no report or knowledge of such events took place that they know of. multiple vehicles that seemed to have noticed the event who either stopped or slowed downed went back to their normal routine. \r\n\r\nafter work, returning home that morning roughly around 0907 hours we made a pass by where it appeared to have exploded over on a few dirt trails. no evidence of debris within the area, and no evidence of video, or documentation was filed on the internet or with in the local region or university. \r\n\r\nduring the event it felt exciting, as well frightening; not knowing what took place or really how to explain it or who to talk to about the event. as well only able to use artistic talents to detail the ship as being the only evidence while having no photo or video, as well no other eye witnesses stepping forward due to uncertainty or fear of the unknown. \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:57","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Insignia, Other,

leaving a vapor trial, i saw a round sphere straight above me. it was round in shape with a bronze color to it. i could only see the bottom of this craft. it did not move, but i was only able to watch it for a few seconds, before the only cloud in the sky drifted under it. i waited a few more minutes hoping to see it again. after the cloud moved away the craft was gone. it's is hard to say how big it was, but it was smaller and lower than the plane passing over. when i saw it, i knew for sure what i was looking at.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

moment. my sister's fiancé,my father and me were on our home's roof. we live in a 3 story building,we were discussing about personal matters, and i noticed a star,white like a star but bright like a sun.I know all of the stars that observable in southern hemisphere,so i knew it was definitely not a star.So i pointed it out to my sister's fiancé and my father and it was very below from the sky and around 30 to 40 feet above the ground, and then it started to rise upward,very slowly and then stopped at around 100 feet above the ground,then it started to move over a mosque which is just in front of my home and stopped over it,i was recording it all on my nokia 6120c and i still have it, we all were amazed about it,but they were not as much as i am,so i ran downstairs to tell my sisters about what i saw,but they really didn't care,by the time i came back,it was gone.I had a very poor quality camera that time, it was all shaky and low definition, but it was a complete reassemble to what happened in jerusalem ,july 2007.I made this whole video on windows movie maker putting all the evidence at that time,and ignore my grammar,i was only 15 then.","distance":"21-100

early to have a stop up the road as realised to early for work had a ciggerette.\r\n\r\nwill sound odd, but i looked at what i think was the pole star/north star.. brightest horison star just above the buildings on my right.. this is afar as there was a factory estate yard view between all buildings so i had a good view.\r\ni actually had a thought to ask for help.. or something like that.. bit of one of those stupids thoughts.. what supprised me was 4 sets of 2 lights, that came right from the star area.. like they just switched on.. comming at what i would call fast helecopter speed.\r\n\r\ni cannot determine hight as no clowds, but they were high, yet still large.\r\n\r\nthe had what i would class as two curved lights either side of what looked circular, it was dusk at this time.... this is how they looked () pretty much like glowing bright white flying brackets.\r\n\r\n3 flew in a semi straight line, buy slightly up n down, the 4th, suddenly as passed over, changed direction onto another path but in same direction as if changing formation.\r\n\r\nthere were no lights or sun that could reflect from, nor did the light change shape or intencity from far in horizon from side of star, to far past the opposite side after being overhead. then all 4 vannished, in what i would say was about 130/140 degrees, if you assume 0 degrees on the side of sun first seen and 90 degrees when overhead.\r\n\r\nyou could see stars overhead in all directions, there were no clouds.\r\n\r\nim staying anonn from public, because of my profession, study and standing.\r\nin relation to my initial call to a star resulting in a cercumstantial event, and the fact i now see some alien eyes and face in dreams since, not everyday, not always when asleep.\r\n\r\nmake of what i said what u will. this isnt the first ufo ive seen or things like esp etc.. but this is the first ufo exp ive witnessed at close range that i cannot conciously deny as being anything other than a ufo.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
