became two orbs hovering. i asked wife to record using the mobile phone. after few seconds, that orb move back towards the primary orb and appeared to have been absorbed making it a single orb again. one that happened, the orb hovered up slightly and went dark for about 30 seconds or so, then it reappeared and glowing brighter.  after few seconds once again, it appeared to drop something that was glowing and appeared to reflect a slight streak of light downwards towards ground. a few seconds after that, the primary orb release a second orb once again, which hovered a little distance away from primary, of which then was quickly absorbed back by primary orb and went dark, loosing sight. we have a video of which unfortunately is not the best and does not serve justice to support what we truly

are steady beams and some blink. this object was pulsing just one colour, a red-orange. the pulse was slow, and seemed to range from bright to off. it looked low in the sky, like maybe at \"traffic

but i couldn't figure it out before it disappeared.  same night, again a grid but this time i heard in my husbands voice him calling me to look though he was asleep..  i again saw a grid over his entire chest with letters and amazing drawings of various animals..  again, i could not figure it out before it disappeared... one more time that same night - a grid on the sheets - i tried to straighten it out to see, but again it disappeared..  these events have happened on and off the past week or more..  last night - again there was a huge grid on wall..  this time there were english words and phrases - but one block on the grid was a clock with the hands moving forward quickly..  the clock was the only character on the grid that was both red and flashing.  \r\n\r\nthe times there were webs with various things on them - it was huge and across the ceiling...  a number of times i could feel the various creatures in the web with my hand.  a few times there were creatures on the covers of the bed.. i could feel the movement on the covers..  two nights ago three insects kept flying around the room..  they landed on the bed and all disappeared at the same time..  when the grid appeared on the wall - i got a flashlight, and they disappeared immediately.  same with turning on the light....  \r\n\r\ni have never been scared (except when the web had spiders and i'm afraid of them).  i truly feel they are trying to send a message of some sort.. i just can't decipher it.  when i wake my husband to look -

looked in my rear view mirror, three bright red lights, forming an elongated triangle shape, stood out immediately in the sky.\r\n\r\nright away i knew it was something abnormal. the three lights occupied a large portion of the horizon behind me and were brighter/wider than the traffic lights i could see north of me. there's absolutely nothing in the area that could have created those lights, no towers or tall buildings. i parked across the street to photograph it, alongside fresno high school and diagonal from my house.\r\n\r\nthe three red lights moved in unison giving me the impression it was a single object. it went from west of palm street to east of palm before staying stationary in the sky. the lights moved horizontally. as i proceeded to get my camera out, the three reds lights faded out one by one. first the top most point, then the bottom right point and finally the bottom left point. about 10 seconds after the lights faded out, a small airplane flew across the area in the sky i was looking towards. i realized the red lights were very high in the sky compared to the position of the airplane, which came from ne and flew sw. a single picture was taken as the final red light faded out.\r\n\r\ni was excited to see this object because on feb. 24, 2014 i witnessed two v-shaped objects hover over my neighbors house and over me at a very low altitude (which i reported, mufon cms # 54312). those objects had the same big red lights under them as i saw last night, but this formation gave me the impression that it was bigger than the objects i saw last year.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of it when the three red lights faded out one by one. i couldn't make out anything between the lights. i stood in the street and looked for 5 minutes, but couldn't see anything. the entire

observer of the night sky. i live on a farm and have very little light pollution. i opened the window and looked out and noticed an object beside venus. i watched the object for a short while and then got my binoculars. i could not see the object with the binoculars. i rushed and got my recording equipment hooked up to my scope to record the thing. the wind was gusting up to 60mph and heading in a sw direction, directly towards me. i hung out of my window and filmed it for approx 4 mins. it moved slowly from one side of venus to the other. clouds passed at about 4 mins and then the object just vanished. none of this was visible to the naked eye. i did not have my ir illuminator on. some have suggested it is lens flare. i have filmed bright objects like venus, jupiter and the moon and not got lens flare before. i was not shooting through a window. it was open and to the right of me. the actual gap i had to film was only 6 inches, so i was unable to move either side much. it was very windy and the wind was blowing in my face quite a bit.\r\n\r\nlater when i went to bed, i heard a buzzing sound. i thought it was the wind vibrating off something, but it has never done it before and we are in a very windy location. no one else could hear the buzzing sound. i was still able to hear it even wearing ear plugs. the following day, i felt very weird and fuzzy in the head. i could not think straight and kept forgetting where i'd put things. i also had an overwhelming urge to debunk what i had witnessed the previous night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

thanksgiving 2012, i was doing 75 mph pulling a trailer with my motorcycle on it, i noticed two 18 wheelers ahead of me about 300 yards in the right lane, when i got about 35 yards from them i started to get in the left lane, all of a sudden a bright light appeared in the left lane with an object about the size of a large car in front of the light, i slammed on my brakes and my tires were sliding, the back end of my truck was starting to slide sideways, i thought to my self that i was going to hit this thing and die, the next thing i know is i was about 100 yards ahead of the trucks parked on the right side median, i waited a minute or two to get my bearings, i got out and checked the front and back of my truck and my bike, absolutely nothing was wrong with anything which i thought was impossible, there was no way that i missed what was in the road, it was right there in front of me, i looked back and saw the two trucks stopped in the road and the left side of the road was still lit up like it was day time, i looked at it for about 3 minutes, there was no smoke,no other cars coming my way nothing was happening so i got a flashlight from my truck and started walking towards the 2 trucks,i walked about 25 yards then stopped, i got this feeling that i should not go over there so i went back to my truck and watched for about another 2-3 minutes and still no movement no sound nothing so i got back in my truck and left. still to this day i know that there is no way that i could have missed what was in the road, i believe that something saved my life that night, what it was i will never know.","distance":"21-100

any lights, i got up and went to open my front door to get some air. when i opened the door i observed a glowing object floating around the bushes next to my porch. it was smaller than a basketball, about the size of a melon. it was not a solid glow but seemed to glow more in some places than others with a bluish-white light. it moved around the bushes similar to the way a butterfly would move, as if it was checking out the bushes. i was dumbfounded. when it got to where i couldn't see it from inside, i stepped out on the porch and watched it go several feet further along the bushes, then it flew up into the tree near my porch. after it flew up into the tree i couldn't see it any more. i went back into my house and went to the window to see if i could spot it in the tree. as i leaned forward to look up in the tree, i noticed a craft of some kind sitting in the sky between and above my house and the tree. it immediately moved slowly so it was positioned behind the tree where i could no longer see it. it had at least 2 white lights on the bottom. it made no noise. it's basic shape was saucer shaped but the dome on top was more angular shaped than rounded. i went back out on the porch to see if i could see it. it had just started raining. i couldn't see it from the porch and was a little hesitant to go out in the yard to try to spot it. i then went back inside and to my back porch but could no longer see it. i just want to know, whether it is from this planet or some other, what it was doing in my yard at 3 am.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500

stopped to watch the ufo, which was 250 feet away(distance verified on google earth).  the ufo was approximately 20 feet in length and 8 feet high, very dark flat gray, no windows, no sound, shaped like a football with the nose cut off and had slightly concave sides.  there were 3 red light on the front(top and bottom corners)and a large bright white light on the rear point.  if viewed from the bottom the ufo would probably have appeared as an elongated triangle with curved sides.\r\n\r\nafter observing the ufo for what may have been a minute i was suddenly aware that that we were again moving and some distance from where we had stopped.  did we lose time, were we abducted,  i'm not sure i want to know!\r\n\r\ninterestingly this event took place three week before the launch of apollo
