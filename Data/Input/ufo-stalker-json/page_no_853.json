vivid. it is is the only thing i have ever experienced that i have no explanation for.\r\n\r\nthis took place in northern hillsborough county florida. it was about 9pm, it was dark and i took my dog out. i was standing in my yard on the north side of my house. north of my house is a field with powerlines and to the northeast of that, a lake. \r\n\r\nas i was standing there looking at the night sky towards the northwest. beyond the lake, i noticed a solid black object in the sky. it looked like a black silhouette against the night sky. my first thought was an aircraft then i noticed it had no lights. it was roughly .5 to 1 mil away from me, a rough guess. as i looked at it closer, it swooped down towards me at an impossible angle and speed. it stopped and hovered slightly to my northwest about 200-300 feet off the ground. it was not directly above me. it's nose was pointed to the east, with its tail to the west. it made no sound at all, completely silent. i stood there watching it while it hovered for what felt like 2-3 seconds, completely frozen.\r\n\r\nafter it hovered for 2-3 seconds it spun around and ascended to the northwest and was out of sight in the blink of an eye. again, at a speed and angle that no man-made aircraft can achieve. it defied physics. i ran inside frantic and panicked.\r\n\r\nit was solid black, no lights and completely silent. it was shaped like an isosceles triangle. i would estimate its size at about 100 feet long and 50 feet wide.","distance":"101-500

time. while observing the eastern skies toward phoenix i asked my friend if the bright light over the san tan foothills was maybe saturn or jupiter. he said he didn't know. it was the largest and brightest object in the sky besides the moon. upon observing the object, it faded into darkness. at that time i told my friend to look and when he did we both observed the object re appear back to its original brightness and size. it was getting brighter and then dimmer many times. thought it was a plane heading toward us which would explain why it wasn't moving. then my wife came outside to see what the comotion was and she observed the object and was in \"awe\". she kept asking what in the world is that? we all observed the object get dim and fade into darkness just leaving a vague light barley visible to the eye. three planes flew by over the next 30 minutes but they seemed to be further off in the distance. the object did hover to its left then back to its right(slightly) and descended a bit then went back to its original position in the sky. on the outside of the object you could see a red glow but would always return to the white bright glowing light. we observed this light fade and reappear several times before eventually fading away into darkness. my friend did film it on his camera phone but the quality wasn't that good because it was off in the distance maybe a mile or two. this was the second sighting i had seen from my backyard. the first one i saw was ne direction over williamsfeild airport about two years earlier. light was smaller but faded in and out of view and moved in acute angels unlike anything i had ever seen. i observed that one alone so i didn't want to report it.  so happy this time my wife and buddy saw the same thing i

left again light followed turned right ,light followed. turned into driveway. when got out of car expecting to hear helo rotors. looked up as craft described above flew over. looked at wife and said **** that thing is longer than our street.  she said, doesn't make a sound either. then my daughter ,who was about7or 8 said dad it doesn't have any tail wings. it was a bright moon lit nite. we could see the shape very well. it appeared to be a gunmetal grey. had red lights front and rear of all 3 fuselages that stayed on steady. i guess the altitude to be about 1200 ft. it was traveling east at maybe 25 mph. told wife, let's follow it. we all got back in car. as i was backing out of driveway, told wife, i'll drive you tell me which way to go. as i backed out , had just put car in gear when wife said never mind it's gone. i asked where did it go? she said i don't know. when i blinked my eyes it was not there anymore. i did have a set of christmas lights in a tree that were setup to look like a flying saucer that was spinning. neighbors said it made them dizzy. can't win them all. that's my story. i'm divorced now ,but ex will still agree with what we saw. daughter still remembers also. remember telling wife (was working in naval shipyard at time) the center fuselage was larger then aircraft carrier that was working on. the center fuselage was about 1/3 larger and longer than the outer two. center fuselage was approx. 75-100 ft. dia. and close to 1/4 mile long. steet i lived on was close to 1/4 mile long. that's what i guaged it by. i remember telling wife, we could put every house on our street inside that center fuselage. i kept asking, how can something that big fly 25 mph and stay in the sky, much less making no sound at all. norfolk airport landing pattern is just west of my house. we could hear a plane landing in the background.As far as feelings we were all left in aaw. had no other whitnesses. all were inside or in bed.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

is significant.\r\n\r\n tonights sighting, march 2nd, 8:15 pm; i was driving north on highway 101 in a toyota pickup truck, periodically looking out my window for ufo's, as i had what i consider my first real sighting a week prior. during one of my quick glances i spotted a triangular craft with orange lights one each corner. it was very far up, maybe a couple miles, going very fast traveling south. it came in and went out of my sight within a few seconds. i yelled \"there it is again!\" and pulled the truck over as fast as i could, though i knew it would not be fast enough. the sighting was on a large straightaway in the mountains. there are no streetlight's, and there were no other vehicles, and the sky was clear, no clouds. \r\n\r\nthe first sighting occurred on around the 25th of february. i was in the exact same area, going down the same straightaway. it was dark, approximately 7-8pm. i was driving a large old suburban truck, having a conversation, listening to my father in the passenger seat. i started to see something flying towards me. my brain registered hawk, which is something that you see flying here in the daytime. it was large, orange and seemingly floating in front of me, coming towards me. i was focused on driving and listening to the conversation, but also confused about what i was seeing floating towards me, when it finally closed the gap between us. i screamed out \"whoah!\" as a triangular craft flew over our truck and banked off into the only clouds in the sky. this all happened within ten seconds. when the craft banked, i clearly saw its outline. triangular, with flat corners, an orange light on each corner. it was a strange shadowy color on the bottom. when the craft first approached i'd say it was a couple hundred or more feet above the highway and to the left over a large valley. i think the craft was large, maybe a little smaller than a commercial jet. it flew very fast. i was extremely shaken up after the sighting while driving. i'm not sure how to describe the feeling, but it was almost overwhelming. \r\n\r\nthe straightaway where these sighting takes place is on the west side of a mountain. looking to the west there is a large valley then more mountains. each sighting was in the same spot, the main difference being altitude.

[the guard was \r\n\r\ncarrying a rifle but no live rounds were issued because they \r\n\r\nwere not on a range at the time] he kept hearing a voice in his \r\n\r\nmind that said, \"don't be afraid, we won't hurt you.\" \r\n     the guard heard one of the beings in the woods behind him \r\n\r\nand felt he was being trapped so he ran away. he came upon \r\n\r\nanother group of gi's some distance away and told them his \r\n\r\nstory. he pleaded with them to come to our position and they \r\n\r\nwouldn't. they assumed he was intoxicated on something.\r\n     he stayed with them until morning then came back toward our \r\n\r\nposition. looking down a hill he saw a silvery, cigar shaped \r\n\r\ncraft still where it landed the night before. he ran back to the \r\n\r\nother gi's and again begged them to come with him. they again \r\n\r\nrefused to come. he waited a few more hours and then came back \r\n\r\nto our camp when all of us saw him. he told us the story, and \r\n\r\nsomeone found the aiming stake he had thrown.\r\n     the sargeant that slept a few yards from me said he had the \r\n\r\nstrangest dream of being examined in a brightly lit operating \r\n\r\nroom. he also said he had an awful headache in the top of his \r\n\r\nhead. along with this, the grassy area where we slept appeared \r\n\r\nto have had a core sample taken from it. a round spot of grass \r\n\r\nand dirt a few inches deep were missing.\r\n     the platoon sargeant recalled hearing the guard yelling \r\n\r\ndesperately for help but he could not move.\r\n     my apc had the infrared lenses cracked and everything \r\n\r\nelectrical was burned out. i remember the maintenance crew in \r\n\r\nour company asking what happened. they had never seen this kind \r\n\r\nof damage to a vehicle before. my apc had to be towed in to base \r\n\r\nthat night, later to be sent back to ordinance.\r\n     the colonel, our battalion commander, wanted some \r\n\r\nexplanation for all of the damages. when he was told, he said he \r\n\r\ncould not file an official report, because only one person was a \r\n\r\nwitness to the event.\r\n\r\n     my personal experience of that night involved a watch i was \r\n\r\ngiven for graduation. it was anti-magnetic and glowed in the \r\n\r\ndark, but that night it stopped working and glowing.\r\n     i knew the guard who was on duty that night, and after the \r\n\r\nincident he was very emotionally disturbed. he was sent away and \r\n\r\ni never saw him again.\r\n     i don't have any recollections myself of that night but i \r\n\r\nreally would like to know what that was.\r\n     i am leaving the other mens' names out for their privacy.\r\n\r\n        in 1966, i was in us army-a company-2nd battalion-21st \r\n\r\ninfantry-24th

house and we were out driving with the real estate agent to the new prospective house. it was late in the cold, march or april day. the details i cannot quite remember. but i know it was dark, and seemed kind of late to me at the time.\r\n     we were driving west and to the right of us was an open field, with a line of hospital buildings spotting the terrain. my father was driving, the real estate agent was in the front, and my mother, brother(three years my elder), and myself were all in the backseat.\r\n     my brother and i were both looking out of the back window, upside down-like. and that's when we both spotted the three objects that were approaching the field and descending. we quickly got our mothers attention, and she looked out and saw as well. i remember her saying, \"what the hell is that?!\" and that's when the real estate agent looked out to his surprise and saw the same anomaly. \r\n     there were three objects, now hovering. as i remember they were three different shapes (although my brother only remembers seeing one).\r\ni remember seeing a triangle, a rectangle, and a circle. all of them had lights (i don't remember colors), and the strangest thing that i recall was that they were all moving in a flipping motion.\r\n     they came within a few hundred feet above the tree lines, and the only one that didn't get a chance to see them was my father. by the time he pulled the car over (which my mother demanded he did so he can see it), the objects flew away straight up into the sky and out of sight faster than anything i've ever seen. the real estate agent's face was pure white and he said, \"i've never seen anything like that before...\"\r\n     i was very young, but in shock. i could not sleep that night, and that memory will always be with me. i just want some validity to it. i just want to know that what i saw was real. \r\n     this did happen very close to o'hare airport (about 2-3 miles). but i'm sure what we saw didn't move in any form of physics that we have ever seen. and here i am, 32 years later. and i still recall. we still recall.\r\n     ","distance":"21-100

preston uk, with 2 friends in the front. we had been camping and were returning home. i can't remember  the exact date but i can remember it was june 1995 and the time was around 2am.\r\ni happened to look out the rear window and immediately noticed a large black triangle in the sky, with three reddish lights one on each corner. it was difficult to tell in a moving vehicle, and in the dark, exactly how far away the object was and whether it was moving or stationary, but it was definitely there and very distinct. \r\ni said to my friend who was in the front passenger to look at it, which he turned himself around in the seat and did and he witnessed the object too.\r\nwe both continued to watch out the rear window, the object being at about a 45 degree angle, for several minutes, at first the object seem to stay at the same pace as the car, but after these few minutes it began to fade in the distance as we were moving on the motorway, this made me realise that at some point it must have became stationary. it faded further to the point were it had almost vanished, i could just about make out the lights, when unbelievably the friend who was driving the car said \"is that what your looking at\" and pointed up out of his front window, again about a 45 degree angle, and there it was a huge triangle, around several 100 feet above the car, but again difficult to tell exact height. however what was evident to me immediately was i had just watched the object disappear in the rear distance, only for it to appear in front of the car literally in the blink of an eye. this completely amazed me.\r\nthis observation to the front of the car, the triangle was extremely clearly silhouetted even more as the light in the night sky had changed looking out the front window as opposed to the rear. the sighting was also now confirmed by a 3rd witness. the driver had not been able to see the object when it was behind the car for obvious reasons, but he could now see it too.\r\nthe object again seemed stationary as almost straight after seeing it again it moved back to the rear window, i.E. we seemed to be travelling under it. and again the object faded into the rear distance over a period of several minutes, when amazingly the exact same thing happened again, the triangle appeared in front of the car in seconds. we were all completely transfixed by what was happening.\r\nthis 2nd time, the object seemed to move forward with the car for around 5 minutes, 45 degrees out the front window to the right hand side. \r\nit's next movement amazed us further, it moved extremely quickly forward, turning to the left with a long bending movement, and started to descend, travelling across our path, i.E from the right hand side across the motorway onto our left, and after about 30 seconds it had moved about 90 degrees to the left hand side of the vehicle and still very visible and still moving, when it eventually disappeared behind a tree line.\r\nwe did not see the object again.\r\nsome points:\r\n-the whole event last around 15-20 minutes.\r\n-for brief moments the outline of the triangle would disappear, particularly when the viewing angle was lower and it seemed to descend at the end of the event, however, it was always clearly visible by the lights on each corner, they were constantly visible, sometimes bright and sometimes faded, but constantly visible.\r\n-the 1st occasion the object moved to the front of the car i saw it for at least one or two full minutes very very clearly, whatever it was it was very large, very dark with a clear definitive triangle outline, had a reddish light on each corner. very very clear sighting.\r\n-i have been fascinated by these triangles ever since, and ufos in general, and have wondered for 20 years whether what i actually saw was an extraterrestrial object, or a government project of some kind that the public are unaware of, whatever it was it was definitely real and i will never forget it!","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

(i am 37 years old now.) it's not something that i have wished to talk about, just because of the stigma attached to it. but something began happening recently that has forced me to confront the uncomfortable reality. let me back up a bit. shortly after my childhood abduction, i noticed a mysterious, oval-shaped mark on my lower left leg, right above my ankle. it is purple and the outer edges look very much like a laser burn. i didn't really make a connection between the mark and my abduction at the time. i just figured that it would eventually go away. but here i am, more than twenty years later, and not only has it not gone away, but it has never even faded with the passage of time. it is as fresh today as it was when it first appeared all those years ago. it is located on a part of my leg that is not easy for me to look at. however, recently i began taking close-up photographs of the mark and really looking at it. i was not prepared for what i discovered. i saw very distinct alien faces in the center of this inexplicable mark. they are not the stereotypical alien images. and they are somehow changing. in fact, to date, a new face appears just about every day. there is a white material inside the oval-shaped mark and it is this white film that is somehow morphing into these different alien \"portraits\". i have even captured video of the process taking place, in between the transition of faces. since i have decided to go public with my story, ufos have been appearing outside my house on an almost nightly basis. of course, in addition to the photos, i still have the physical mark on my leg for anyone to see in person who wishes to do so. i am sending you the photos for you to review and analyze. i am open to any and every kind of expert examination in order to verify that this is a real phenomenon. thank you for your time and god bless.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

ridge australia. my self and 4 friends arrived back to my camp / caravan on the out skirts of town, at just past 3pm in the afternoon.\r\n\r\non one side of my caravan was plastic bbq chairs we where all sitting on. to one end of my caravan was a large gum tree. i lent back in my chair and looked up and hovering directly above the gum tree was a craft. the surface is very hard to explain. but shimmered a variation of colors primary reds, orange, yellows over a solid surface that looked like machined cast iron aka (not real shinny) like alloy or steel. best way to describe it was like paint swirling on the top of water.\r\nthe surface then began to change the best description i can give is the surface of the object started to protrude. closest thing i can put it to is when you see and object dropped in a bucket of water in slow motion, the way it peaks. the whole surface did the same thing and the shards got longer and changed color to a ghostly white until it consumed me. everything even my peripheral vision. i was just enveloped in the light its self.The light its self characteristics where like looking up at a waters surface from underneath the water. the way the light refracts, only white. i remember being conscious of standing with my toes pointing down. witch should not have been the case as i was sitting in my chair like the other 4 people with me. \r\nafter what felt like around 30s to 1 minute i was sitting in my chair with my arms crossed on my lap to one side looking at the ground. as i lifted my head i noticed all the others where sitting in the same position and starting to look up at each other. \r\ntruth is i thought i had some heat head spin or something like that and was not going to say anything. then steven 1 of the 4 who was sitting just across from me said. \"call me crazy but did any of you just see that\" we all jumped to our feet saying \"hell yes it was just\" .... we paused because the object was still above us back to its original shape and color. after a few \"f&ck me\" expressed by us all it started to move away. there was a clearing from the back of my caravan of around 100 meters to the tree line. we literally brisk walked next to it as it moved away towards the treeline without a sound. i could have thrown a rock at it, it was that close. as it passed over the tree line arron said lets get torches and follow it see if it lands. i remember arron and i exchanging a quick look of recognition as it was almost dark around 5:15 pm non daylight savings time. we all ran back to arron's house to find torches and told his mother and also shaun's parents who's house backed on to arron's naturally they called us crazy. we spent the next few hours trading descriptions of what happened and all seemed to match my own. it was spotted around 350 km away that night in a town called dubbo. witch made it to the local paper. \r\nnow the odd thing to this day that bothers me... the light that surrounded me / us. and what happened to the time. i know 100% the craft exists but i can not say i or we saw aliens. i left lightening ridge not long after and lost contact with the lads i was with. over the years i have had endless dreams of being on craft, dreams of alien faces a few inches above me. i wake regularly out of a deep sleep to such an uneasy feeling that i get up and check on my kids and look in every room. i have watched almost every video over the years on hundreds of social media in the hope to see or hear something that looks or sounds close to what we saw. and with the exception of maybe 5 i have read or viewed i never have. people who post picks or video of dots of light. are just that dots of light and nothing more. im still waiting for that one photo or video that i can say that is the real deal. their is one incident that i saw that im not ready to debunk. a laddie over in the stated while at a busy intersection claims to have see an object and it let off a odd light. and the guy who hosted the show tried to debunk her by saying to many people where around and someone else would have seen something. the light i / we saw consumed you and held you captivated by it completely. imo it could happen to 1000s at once and you would never know. \r\narron still lives in lightening ridge as i found a post in the paper from their in 2014. sean invest, steven and arrons older brother lee im not sure of his whereabouts. \r\ni have recently gone to a physiologist and told him the story but he can't help as it was the first time anyone has ever told him anything like it. so at current time im left with unanswered questions that i may never get answered. all i can say is it changed my life and continues too till this day. i will take a polygraph test what ever it takes just to get answers. thanks and i hope this helps in some way shape or form. feel free to ring or email me with any other questions.","distance":"21-100

which crescents are located differently as the moon would appear in canada. i could only see 35 degrees to my left (south) as the hotel blocked my view. on feb 21 or slight possibility the 22/2015 at
