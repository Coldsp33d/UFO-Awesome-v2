backseat. we were leaving philadelphia a little after 11pm via the walt whitman bridge past the stadiums and near the airport. i drive through this area constantly (multiple times a day) and am very familiar with the air traffic. \r\n  i saw a string of 7 or so lights spaced slightly uneven from about 10 degrees above horizon up to maybe 75 degrees. they seemed like individual objects in a formation and glowed yellow (almost orange). they appeared almost exactly like a constellation. my first thought was that the stars were bright on this night until i observed that there was absolutely no glimpse of stars anywhere else. as we travelled east my perspective of the objects changed and i saw that they were actually very close (possibly a mile away) and could not have been attached to anything man-made because of the constant and deliberate spacing and the sheer height of highest light. they were probably 4 or 5 times the height of citizens bank park, but the lowest seemed about level with the stadiums. i discussed with the other passenger what they could be, and as we pondered an airplane taking off from the philly airport flew over and gave us the perspective we needed to realize these objects weren't attached to a building, a string, or anything else we could think of. we ruled out chinese lanterns. only industrial buildings are underneath, and these objects were much too stationary and singular in brightness. at this point we realized we were watching something unidentifiable to us, and we continued to observe as we started crossing the bridge. unfortunately, the driver could not look back at this point since the lights were now out the back window of the car near the passenger side, and driving over the bridge at that time is difficult. and unfortunately the lights were now too far away to snap a decent photo. at this point the bottom 3 lights (which were a bit closer together and more horizontal in relationship than the rest) started moving in various directions so that we could rule out the fact that they might have been attached to something larger if manmade. the objects did not disappear or move much more before we drove out of sight, so the actual duration of the event is unknown.\r\n   i immediately searched online for any news or reports, but didn't find anything until i got home and checked the recent reports on here. what i found was interesting because case 63646 on feb 26th 2015 (2 days earlier) described very similar objects on the opposite end of the city. the photos uploaded for that particular event were exactly what i saw, but the movement described in that case was much more sophisticated and less static. however, based on the final movement by the bottom objects in my case, i see no reason to believe these objects weren't capable of those maneuvers and would even go as far as to say we saw the same objects, based on the closeness in time, space, and appearance. i just want to know what i saw, and am reporting this so that other people who witnessed something similar (or this exact event) can be assured they saw something phenomenal without fear of ridicule. very interesting.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

twice on this.  the second time i did not feel so scared because i saw on a ufo show that it's possible when your in a ufo you can see through it.  i think that's what happened to me.  but i was more in a ball.  i was slightly layed back (think reclined postition) and felt my legs and body was curled up.  it i knew i was not gonna be killed or worried about running out of air and if i had known i would return back to earth safely i might have enjoyed the trip and been more curious...However...I didn't.  but i could scream, i couldn't move, i couldn't talk...All i could do was watch in horror.  \r\n\r\nps ~ please note i call these \"dreams\" in my blogs.  it makes me comfortable thinking them as dreams.  i don't believe any of the things that i turn into mufon or write about are dreams at all.  i think they happen at night so it's easier to call them dreams.  most of the experiences i have i was dreaming...Wake up and these things are what i wake up to.   so forgive me if i keep calling them \"dreams\"...I have to have my comfort zone.\r\n\r\nhere's what i wrote about.  write this aug 2014.  believe the event took place july 2014 or the beginning of aug 2014.  it starts out with me wondering why anyone would want to go to mars...\r\n******************************************************\r\n\r\ni want to ask why anyone would even want to do that…but i’m not.  i just feel for people who will actually go there and never come back.  now if you could come back…yeah….I could see that.  even if you had to live there like five years before returning.  yes, maybe.  be like a job.  however i don’t want to go.  i’ll tell you why…because…yep, another (realistic) dream i had.  a hellacious dream i had.  it was short and ….Scary, when it might have been exciting and beautiful but i don’t want to do that again.  so here again *bows* i am to share another emotional moment in a dream i had.\r\n\r\ni suddenly awake or maybe become aware and i can feel my heart jump into my chest.  “no, no no no nooooo!” i scream in my head.  i can’t talk, i can’t really move.  i don’t think i’d want to anyway because i”m paralized with fright of what might happen if i do.  i’m kinda curled up, i think…really i can’t think i just want to back.  i’m flying through space faster than anything i could imagine.  i’m passing things in a blink of the eye.  where’s earth, where’s my home, the trees, the fresh air..Even the ground.  i want to lay on it, even in it.  drink up the smell of dirt, the feel of the planet.  my home.  what of my family.  how am i alive!  am i dead?  oh god, i pray over and over and over again, please take me back, where am i going, i don’t want to be here.  how do i get back.  suddenly i slow some, there to my right is a huge, huge, huge planet.  it’s a dark brownish color(almost dark purple).  i see no blue at all.  it’s huge, i’m almost curious but not too much because i want to go back to earth.  i never ever in my life realized how much a part of my soul is in earth.  i suddenly realized how very alone you would feel without your world.  it’s heart ache like nothing you could imagine.  especially if you couldn’t even look upon it.  would i ever see our planet, or even our solar system again?  i wasn’t in our solar system, though the planet i was whizzing by reminded me of jupiter.(but much much bigger).\r\n\r\n what ever pulled me and dragged me away so so soooo far away and why i don’t know why.  it seemed such a cruel joke.  i didn’t know if i was dead and my spirit was just gonna float around for eternity in space.  maybe millions upon millions of years, somehow i’ll pass by earth again.  if i wasn’t dead, how do i get back.  how am i even alive.  the speed i was going should shatter me.  i’m not in a craft(i didn't see a craft but felt like i was in one possibly), i’m just curled up in a ball and flying….Whizzing by things.  but that large jupiter planet is what i must have been there for.  because as soon as i noted that planet, i was back home and waking up.  my heart still pounding i climbed out of bed and never wanted to sleep again.  i laid on the floor and thanked god for bringing me back.  you can lose everything, your family, your friends, your money, your health, even your life…but you never, never, never, ever realize how much your loved and are truly apart of this world until your taken out of the solar system.  i would have been happy with just a piece of rock from earth with me.  the energy and vibe, the aliveness ..It’s apart of you, apart of me.  you can die and turn to ash or dirt, but your still home.  your soul can go to heaven but you will still feel peace knowing apart of you is home on the planet.\r\n\r\ni would never!  wish a dream like that to anyone.  it sounds cool doesn’t it?  it’s not, it’s horrible.  i feel like i let myself down.  in my dreams i visit what i would say are other realities or worlds, but that one was to real, to personal.  i feel i wish i had confidence to have gone further or maybe seen if i could have gone down into that huge world…but i swear it was real, to real….And i didn’t know it was a dream.  no no no..Never again.  so now i hope i never leave this world.  i love flying in airplanes, i love roller-coasters..But that dream i recently had not to long ago….I…just don’t know.  i think the closer i’m to the ground the safer i feel.  i don’t want another space

though these almost seemed like dreams i'm pretty i am believe these strange things happened.  i have woke up with strange bruises and scratches but in this event i didn't wake up with anything.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n...I wake up and i’m once again on my back in a very spacious room.  i’m suddenly scared because i remember my last dream in this dream and i’m not wanting to feel pain again.  thats when i realize i’m not laying next to my husband.  once again to my right is another being (he's laying next to me).  it’s a very tall gray alien.  which i can’t figure out.  i thought they were suppose to be small and short?\r\n\r\nhe’s very tall.  his arms are kinda stretched out and my head is below it, so he’s not even touching my head with his arm at the moment.  were laying side by side and there are others around us.  though i know they are there i can’t really remember what they looked like.  i’m not really moving and i am once again completely naked like a jay bird.  i don’t think i’ve ever really had naked dreams.  can’t say i like them at all.\r\n\r\ni take the alien is male and at first i think maybe he’s being subjected to what i had to earlier but he’s not.  though he’s not moving he’s deciding something.  i can’t understand what it is or i don’t know what it is.  in my dream i feel he’s suppose to pick five women for something and right now i’m on his personal trial.  apparently the beings around us are just waiting to find out what he decides before doing what they need to do with me.  i’m horror-struck.  though my husband and i are having issues, i still care what my husband thinks…and i’m thinking he would not like this idea at all.  i don’t think i would like this idea at all.  heck, i don’t know what their being picked for.  food?  i don’t want to be eaten!  i kept thinking ‘don’t pick me, don’t pick me”…suddenly i felt the selection….He did not pick me.  i’m not one of the five he’s choosing.\r\n\r\ni don’t know why…whether good or bad i was not picked.  relieve washes over me.  though he, the large alien, he never moves on my side i suddenly think of how alone i feel and how cold i feel and how grateful i am for not being picked for what ever horror he had in store.  i had the urge to cuddle so i did just that.  i turned on my side and kinda cuddled up to his side.  it made me feel better and i had a sense of love for this very tall gray.  that’s when all hades broke loose.  everything happened in a flash.\r\n\r\ni turned cuddled next to him (though i don't think i actually touch him, just moved close to him) and he…..Well i don’t know.  he moved.  he went from a mummy like stance the entire time to moving so quick it was like being struck by a rattle snake.  he moved so very fast.  which was a surprise.  i always pictures aliens as slow-moving except with their electronics.  this one was faster than any human i ever saw.\r\n\r\neven though this was a dream i still don’t know what he did to me.  i know i felt and though i even heard his group that was watching us even gasp in surprise (i thought they never felt suprise)…which surprised me.  i felt as if they were reaching out for me because even they could not believe he moved that quickly towards me.\r\n\r\nso what did he do?  i don’t know but he moved his head and his left shoulders quickly at me and it looked as if he was attacking my neck.  i woke up almost to my feet because the movement scared me so bad..And now i’m confused.  was he angry with me?  was he going to eat me?  why were the others in shock?  it seemed like they were trying to move to protect me…does that mean he was gonna kill me?   the last two weeks the dream seemed so read i can’t bear the left side of my neck when sleeping without covering it up.\r\n\r\nso was i bite? \r\n\r\n(the ironic thing is i feel like i miss this large scary gray)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":63663,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.52311260765444,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03012015-0013","longitude":-101.89885535459726,"occurred":1417334400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

it came from the back of the house. as i looked out my sliding glass door i noticed a fairly large light, too big to be a star, i then had the wife look and we both agreed it was no star it was too big, but it wasn't moving either. i got my cheap binoculars and we immediately saw multiple colored lights along with a distinctive shape, disc oval.  went outside to get a better look and saw two lights at near ground level in the woods. red and white light.\r\nno explanation for those lights near the ground, for there is no structures behind us for miles, my property borders state forest.  watched these two objects for 50 minutes, the large object in the sky started to move away at approximately 8:10 in a n/e direction toward the lights near the ground, by 8:20 pm both objects were gone.\r\n     saturday feb 28, approximately 5:30 pm a much clearer night and more daylight than the previous night. we got a light show is how i will describe it. i looked out and again saw the bright large light in just about the same spot, this time i grabbed my good nikon binoculars and got the shock of my life, we could see the object itself along with blinking colored lights and spinning in place, it stayed spinning but stationary. i was compelled to have somebody else witness this, i called my neighbor and him and his wife also witnessed all of this, spinning different colored lights.  i then thought to go on the side of my house and see if i see the two lights in the woods that i saw the night before.  i got another shock, i can only describe what i saw as a light show.  i got my neighbor to come and look with my binoculars.  what he saw blew him away, this object was somewhere at ground level, but we could not describe how far or how close. but again this multi lighted object was spinning and flashing, it appeared to be in some way either communicating or signaling to the other object which seemed to be a huge distance away.  let me be clear we are not sure of this communicating that i mentioned.  we only suspect it because the object near the ground seemed to roll and the lights seemed to correlate with the other. meaning, white lights on one object, then object on ground would roll again and it would show blue lights and simultaneously the object in the sky would show similar colored lights, and so on. the other reason for our conclusion, is when both objects move away, they move in the same direction.  that's our story, were just wondering if this could be explained or was this something that can't be explained. and, did anyone else observe this? we have two minutes of video also. we would be glad to tell this in detail, if anyone is interested.

level. without slowing down, and within an inch or two from my face, it just arced right over my head and kept on going along its way. \r\n\r\nnormally, i would have spent some time engaged in an internal debate over what i might have just witnessed. might it have been a june bug, or some other large insect? well if it had been a large insect, it would have more likely impacted right smack in the middle of my head, if not one of my eyes. as it was, any speculative debate was rendered mute within just a second or so afterwards, when a black orb lifted off from the adjacent parking lot. it quickly climbed skywards until it was just a small dark dot in the sky, at which point i got tired of looking at it and went back to work. \r\n\r\nover the last two years, i've experienced quite a few interactions and demonstrations with \"others\" and their resources. the micro sized craft i'm writing about here is one i've nicknamed \"square peg\".\r\n\r\nuntil recently, \"square peg\" was just some small craft that would show up in my photos, usually in close proximity to some other suspicious looking area of the sky that had attracted my attention. prior to this incident on the 20th, i had only seen one first hand once before, when one passed by my patio while i was outside having a smoke.\r\n\r\nfrom prior experience, i've learned that photos uploaded here usually end up jumbled in an entirely different sequence from the order in which they were originally uploaded. so i'll begin by describing the photo where you will see only one \"square peg\". notice that in the background of this photo, taken on monday, february 23rd, you can see what looks like a larger ufo to the left, as well as another one off to the right. \r\n\r\nin the other photo, taken on thursday, february 26th, you'll find three \"square pegs\" in the upper right hand corner of the picture. these crafts were too small in the original photo, so i had to crop this photo from a larger one, which cut out the target craft i was focused on when i took the photo. in both photos you can see some distortion surrounding the \"square pegs\", likely due to the effects of anti gravity propulsion.  \r\n\r\ni'm also including a video, shot on december 13th of 2014. i was filming a rainbow after a storm had passed through, and after reviewing the video later at 1/8th of normal speed, i discovered a triangular pattern of lights rising from the other side of this building. my apartment and patio is on the other side of this building. notice how one of the lights turns to black as it approaches the rainbow, to the point where it more closely resembles a \"square peg\". in the editing process i made a double shot of this sequence, so you'll get to see it twice in the video.\r\n\r\ni don't believe there was any malicious intent involved when i was zinged by a \"square peg\" on february 20th. i'm guessing i was just being bio scanned, and that it was just assumed my eyes and consciousness wouldn't be able to process this thing's speed coming right at me, head on. after a couple of years of being associated with these \"others\", i grown accustomed to their shenanigans. that's just the way it is with arizonaufos.     \r\n     \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

road where that was witnessed is plain hill rd. in baltic. tonight, i had ordered take out and just before i placed my order over the phone, i was staring out my kitchen window towards the hill where i first saw something and noticed the exact same event was occurring again! there was that ball of light, that pulsating, bright, white, low circle! i couldn't believe that this was happening again and as soon as i had placed my order and got off the phone, i took out my ipod and captured two pictures. one had my neighbor's garage in it to kind of give some scale of the event i was seeing and the other was a zoom in picture to maybe make out a source of the light. both came out terrible but they've been attached anyway. again, i immediately thought it had to be a helicopter or a star or a planet or something but then it moved away from the hill and began to head away from where i was. i jumped in my car, grabbed my food, and tried to get it from a vantage point. i sped over to the top of the hill where i had last saw it going and i pulled over to the side of the road. i grabbed my ipod again, got out of my car, and tried to take a picture of it but it was darting away from the hill. i was looking at the light moving around when it split into two orbs (one big, one small) and the small orb rejoined the big orb to form one light circle. then it left into the distance. i got one photo on top of the hill showing the big and small orb after it split in two. unfortunately, the quality of the photos is grainy at best, but i just wanted to document what i've seen as best i could.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

noticed lights in the sky on his side of the car. he woke me up to look at the lights when i looked around i seen lights going in and out of the clouds it was a very dark cloudy night. i then i picked up my phone to record what i thought was lightning but, i was wrong. the lights were bluish white, flashing and spinning then there was a rumble sound like a train that only lasted for as long as the lights were visible. i put down my phone because i remembered my camcorder was in the backseat. i focused on the lights once more and to my surprise the lights had changed color and shape they were now a bright yellow-gold color and looked like two huge spotlights. then the lights changed to a huge grid shape dotted with millions of what looked like christmas lights it changed back to the two spotlights then it turned into two grid shapes, there was no sound this time. i thought had seen a floating home with its christmas lights on, it hovered flat i could see one on top of the other stacked one was brighter than the other from the outline then the grids separated back into the two spotlight shapes and took off like light speed fast. i have been trying to put this whole ordeal to the side so i can focus on my daily routine but, this has been very difficult for me. i am a paraplegic man who is in a lot of pain neuropathy is what it is classified as trying to live a somewhat normal routine after my injury now i have a lot of questions about something i know nothing about. i am hoping you could give me an explanation to what i have recorded and

nice, and noticed two lights traveling in tandem.  they were tilted at an angle of approx 30 degrees with the light on the left being the upper end.  the left light was dimmer than the right light. both were pulsating, but always alit.  since i look towards a major airport, there are often planes in the sky, but this object appeared to be travelling along a path that i have not seen an airplane take and did not look like an airplane. i first thought ufo, then determined that it was moving, and not a stationery planet i was seeing, and so to me this validated the thought.  the two lights looked to be moving together, equidistant the entire time, taking into consideration the retreating angles.  as i observed the lights, they were moving up as well as further away, in a wsw direction.  the angle of ascension was about 40 degrees and the lights got smaller while observing them.  after about a minute, the dimmer left side light was not visible.  after another minute or so, neither was visible.  i was in awe at the possiblity of what i had seen, and thought it was \"pretty cool\".  i was trying to discern anything between the lights, but was not able to do so.  weather was sunny, prdominantly clear, with a few puffy clouds.  just after the disappearance, i then saw an airplane making as ascent from the nearby airport, i did not take video as my equipment is inadequate; taking photos of the sky through either the screen or the dirty window has been a failure in the past; and i did not want to stop watching and risk missing  anything.","distance":"Over One
