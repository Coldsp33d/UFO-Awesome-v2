States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was a bright day with sunshine in the middle of the afternoon. i was a resident of north bennington in the state of vermont. i was ten years of age. i was outside of a shoe store there with a young woman. my parents were in the store shopping, and there were no other people in the vicinity. to my knowledge there were no other witnesses to the event. the two of us were talking together, when we turned to look in noticing a disc that was hovering about five hundred feet away, and about one hundred feet from the ground. there was no sound emanating  from the dark disc. the disc was about thirty feet in diameter. it was a quiet day without inclement weather, and without a wind. there was no vehicular traffic in the area, as this was a rural town. after about fifteen seconds, we both became aware that this was an unidentified flying object. our reaction was one of a mutual wonder and elation in witnessing this event. i mentioned to the young woman that was with me to go into the shoe store and to tell everyone inside to come out and to see this. it took her about thirty seconds to get to the store, and then i was alone with the object that was still hovering in a stationary position. after about fifteen more seconds, the dark colored disc exited the sky in a non-ballistic motion and was gone. there was no engine noise, vapor trail, or any atypical acceleration aspects of the ufo. there were no other people in the store that were able to come out and see this in time. i went back into the shoe store and told the clerk at the counter, and my parents what i had seen. i do not remember if there were other patrons that were in the store when i went back in. the young woman that was with me reiterated what we had seen. the man at the checkout counter was openly in disapproval, as when i was young to have believed in extraterrestrial phenomenon was a sign of a lost contact with reality. my parents sided with the clerk at the counter, as though this was the product of a youthful fantasy of mine, or a mistaken interpretation of what i had seen. after forty five years of trying to make sense of this personal experience, it has taken me this long to venture a description of these events. in the year of 1974, i was nearly a straight a student at a private school in an upper class neighborhood in massachusetts. less than a year and a half later i did not even graduate with a high school diploma at another private school in pennsylvania that was attributed to the mental and physical abuse from my father that ensued after i had witnessed this ufo. both of my parents were involved in classified government research on psychic phenomenon at the edgar cayce foundation. i have been subjected to mental and physical violence all of my life in one form or another as far back as i can remember: i was different, and i have paid a high personal price for this. my father mentally tortured me for the first twenty four years of my life with the hope of inducing a suicidal response in order to prevent the interpretation of these events that was external to the influence of the family that would be outside of their personal discretion to decide for themselves to allow. since the year of 1984 i have been hospitalized fourteen times, and six of those in psychiatric hospitals. i have been made destitute three separate times in my life. for reasons that are still unclear to me, i was being used as a warning to these extraterrestrial intelligences, and to other people, of what will happen to anyone that is given an education by these telepathic being's from other planets that the current security mandates do not control in direct oversight as a classified matter. often this operates outside of the accepted parameters to not violate someone's legal rights in the process by those with a personal as contrasted to a professional interest that operate outside of government regulation. i learned this the hard way, so to speak. after my father illegally disposed of all of my personal property in may of 1984, i found myself at a bus station with eleven hundred dollars with nowhere to go, and nothing to be able to do when i got there. after relocation to the state of hawaii under duress, there was another interesting turn of events that occurred when i was resting in an open field next to hilo international airport about two weeks after i got there. it was a calm night, in an early evening in darkness. in the sky directly above me about one hundred and fifty feet from the ground, three oblong objects that were shrouded in a white mist approached overhead. these appeared to be dirigibles, as one lightly collided with one of the others: extraterrestrial vehicles do not do so, and this was not the result of pilot error: i intuitively knew to not trust this expensive illusion that was meant to parallel the event in 1970. there were numerous other witnesses to this staged event in hawaii, as i could hear other people talking in the background nearby. prior to this formal description that i am providing in the here and now, i had never ventured any communication of my experiences to a branch of the government, or an independent investigative function involved in the research on extraterrestrial phenomenon. there are government security mandates that are outdated that concern the activities of extraterrestrial intelligences, and the intention of these telepathic beings to be here. the machinations that i have observed in the interaction with other people of similar experience with extraterrestrial visitation is to ensure that there is not a concern to the infrastructure of the military as a possible jeopardy. these alien intelligences tend to decide for themselves who it is that is in a position to best bridge this distance to prevent further adversity from happening to innocent people that become the focus of an animosity for just having seen a genuine ufo. those of us that have been caught in this crossfire deserve to be able to make a decent life for ourselves without a censure or a reprimand for having witnessed this type of event. it is unusual for someone at such a young age, such as i was, to have seen an extraterrestrial vehicle. the void creates the need in society, and the function that i filled in this is classified matter is something that i discuss with no one. if i can help even so much as one other person that has seen an actual ufo to be spared the living hell that i have been through, then it all will have been worth it. sometimes to keep to one's self is the best approach until the matter has subsided in controversy. after this long, i have the opportunity to talk about it without a coercion from another perspective forcing a compliance from me personally.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting on my deck looking north with my nikon binoculars (which are sharp enough to make out the galilean moons of jupiter). i was trying to determine whether i could see polaris (from a new house) or if it was obscured by distant trees, with the intent of calibrating my 10-inch celestron some future night, starting with polaris. while i was scanning that northern sky with the binoculars, a craft came into view. it was a triangle, blacker than the background night sky. there were white lights at each of the three corners and none elsewhere nor any of any other color. the lights were not \"pinpoint\" lights but rather appeared to be large flat cirles of light that appeared to be flush with the underside of the craft's body.  the lights were large and flat and disk-like, at each corner of the triangle and clearly within the outline of the triagle as opposed to being *at* the corners or external to the shape of the craft.  the light was a very pure white and even from edge to edge, rather like the sort of light perfectly diffused by a high-quality frosted glass.\r\n\r\nabove that triangular craft, about 2,000-2,500 ft. higher, there were two craft that were almost certainly smallish (likely one-man military) jets flying a parallel course (with the usual rotating beacons of red and blue). i'd estimate their altitude as 10-12,000 feet.  they were flying some significant distance apart (half a mile apprx.) but essentially lined up wingtip to wingtip. comparing the triangular craft to those jets indicated the craft was simply enormous--easily 2 to 3 times the length of an aircraft carrier. there was no sound. the triangle and the two jets were flying from due west to due east, fist sighted to my northwest and leaving my field of view to my northeast.\r\n\r\ni am reporting it at this late date only because it's just tonight that i remembered there was an e-mail in my archive where i'd given a precise date to a friend about the sighting.  i've thought off and on that i should have reported it but couldn't recall the date.  it occurred to me only this evening that i'd mentioned it to a frequent correspondent, an engineer in florida.  a quick keyword search in my outlook archive pulled up the date, so i am reporting it now to mufon and to nuforc.\r\n\r\ni spent 25 years in science and engineering as administrator overseeing many millions of research dollars on a wide variety of projects. one proposal to darpa (unfunded) just a couple of years before the sighting was for the construction of a similarly-large but entirely different sort of craft as something of an aerial aircraft carrier/troop transport. as far as i know, no such craft has been funded nor built, though i reckon it's remotely possible and perhaps has not publicly disclosed. i do know funding *was* awarded to a major corporation to explore potentional for just such a craft (for the very price i'd worked out in my own proposal).  the announcement came just as my own research group was finalizing our own proposal and precluded our submission. \r\n\r\nbut i simply do not believe the craft was \"ours\" as there simply had not yet been enough time from that allocation of funding for mere initial research for such a craft to be designed, much less even a prototype to be constructed. \r\n\r\nand i've no doubt the two jets were military and were shadowing the triangle.\r\n\r\ni'd read reports over the years of such triangular craft so while i was excited to see such a thing, i was not really shocked nor surprised, but essentially just quietly awed and riveted, at attention. i kept my binoculars trained on it until my view of it became obscured by the trees i had reckoned might (and do) obscure polaris from my backyard view.  \r\n\r\ni'd seen the shaky photo of the \"belgian triangle\" a few years earlier and was well-aware of the central red light in that image and noted that there was no central light of *any* color on the triangle i saw.  and unlike the images i've seen on video (tonight, as a matter of fact) which show only relatively small lights which may or may not be connected by a structure, the structure of the craft i saw was clearly evident, jet-black against a significantly lighter night sky of bluish purple, and the edges were crisp.  it was, simply, a large triangle, with the white lights underneath, and those discs of white light were huge in and of themselves, compared to the jets overhead with their typical small pinpoint strobes. \r\n\r\ni have several telescopes and several binoculars and have spent a *lot* of time under the night sky over my 58 years. i've seen a few other unidentifiable things over the years, but nothing like this--an object that was *clearly* a \"craft\" of some type, obviously under intelligent control, in flight, with that flight perfectly matched in speed to the two jets overhead, with neither the jets nor the triangle lagging or overtaking, each maintaining a steady easterly course and steady altitude.)  \r\n\r\ni'm well-acquainted with all sorts of airplanes as my father was a pilot and all-around airplane nut and i spent my childhood bucking rivets helping him build planes and every holiday was spent at some airshow or other and included flights in everything from a ford tri-motor to all sorts of newer civilian and military aircraft.  \r\n\r\nalso, there's a major training airbase here and i lived for 30 years near another that serves as a primary maintenance base elsewhere so i'm quite used to seeing aircraft of all sorts from single-manned fighters to the old b-52s to c5as flying so low their vortices twisted my treetops.  during daylight hours, those planes average one per minute over my home. i'm quite able to identify most, and probably more able than your average person to ascertain a type of plane and altitude and can identify most by sound alone.  (i can also tell you exactly what the busweiser blimp looks like when it crashes to the highway directly ahead on an otherwise pretty friday afternoon.)\r\n\r\nas to what i thought the sept. 2006 object was when i first noticed it, i simply thought, \"i'm seeing a large triangle craft just like i've read about\".  for the reasons i've already stated above, i am all but certain it could not have been anything of terrestrial military origin.  in that minute while i watched it i believed it *was* an extraterrestrial craft and that it was being kept under surveillance by a pair of miltary jets.  when i think of the vast distnces of space, i'm always inclined to lean toward aerial things as having some earthly origin since our nearest neighbors are 59 trillion miles away and have no known habitalble planets. \r\n\r\nbut that said, having thought about this for several years and knowing what i do about earthly craft (as much as one reasonably can without being currently in the industry), i just can't believe that such an enormous craft could remain a secret the way, for example, the sr-71 did for so long, and i will say that in that moment when i viewed it, without all this subsequent thinking about the unlikely odds of \"someone\" travelling those vast cosmic distances, i *knew* in my gut such a craft was beyond the capabilities of any country on earth.  i knew then that we might build such a thing someday, but i didn't believe we had then, nor do i yet think anyone's beyond the preliminary research stage on any such large craft that might prove feasible or useful for military purposes. \r\n\r\nbut not knowing with 100 percent certainty either way, i can only believe it's one of two seeming impossibilities--an earthly craft far beyond the scale of anything ever known (even if not beyond the conception of myself and my former research team), or an otherworldly craft that has travelled the the unimagineable distance no craft conceived by man can yet travel.\r\n\r\nat the time of the sighting, i really knew very little about mufon.  in the years since, i've seen a number of accounts of mufon investigators working with witnesses that seem credible to me.  i've begun to believe the organization is basicly objective in its evaluation of evidence and appropriately skeptical, and also appropriately open-minded to credible and verifiable evidence.  the data of many cases that can not be dismissed satisfactorally by more or less mundane phenomena is of interest to me and i'm adding my own data point here because i believe the inquiry is important, whether the explanation for such events is earthly or extraterrestrial.  i'd have reported it years earlier had i remembered before tonight that i had actually mentioned the sighting to an engineer in florida and had an e-mail record that pinpointed the actual date, without which i felt such a report could not truly be evaluated, since only with that date can my sighting be correlated with other evidence/testimony that might explain it one way or the other. \r\n\r\n(note:  i checked \"wings\" on \"structural features\" above because, simply, such a triangle is essentially a \"delta wing\", rather more like the concorde than the more boomerange form of the old \"flying wing\" i saw fly once when i was a kid. but technically, it is \"wing\", singular, rather than \"wings\" plural but that option is not available in the form above.)\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":63640,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.37615379318389,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02282015-0001","longitude":-97.87941389801205,"occurred":1158044400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1425135847000,"summary":"Clear sighting through sharp nikon binoculars of large triangular craft accompanied by two jets ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"73703","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3091,"locationName":"Enid, Oklahoma","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:55160"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Austin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My daughter and i had just stepped outside to go on a walk. i was noticing how clear of a night it was when i saw something dark move quickly to my left about 70 degrees up. my first thought was cloud but like i said it was a very clear night. then i noticed the lights and you could see the stars being blacked out as it crossed the sky. i have about a half mile of visibility between tree lines and it covered that distance in 5 -

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In november 2001 in the late evening/night i realised that i had run out of nappies/diapers for my baby son & had to walk up to our local 7 to 11 shop up at broadwater,worthing,west sussex to buy some before they closed.I put the baby into his pram & had to get my 10 year old daughter out of bed & into her coat to come with me.We ran up there as it was late made our purchases & started walking home again,we turned into carnegie road & walked past northbrook college & down towards south farm rd where we lived as we drew level with the grave yard in carnegie rd we were looking at the stars as it was a cold & clear winter night & the stars were very visible,i noticed one that appeared very large indeed & pointed at it saying to my daughter\"wow thats a large one!\" as i pointed at it what i had thought was a star shot off at a speed that i have never seen anything move before! i said to my daughter \"my god did you see that?That was no star & the speed of it!\"i remember feeling quite shaken & my daughter replied i know mum but i am more worried about whats above our heads! i looked up & was totally \"gobsmacked!\" i do not know how else to put it,i thought this must be a nightmare & i would soon wake up!Above our heads was a truly massive craft don`t know what else to call it,rectangular in shape & reminded me of a gigantic chessboard because the underneath appeared to be loads of squares but with pulsating lights in which constantly changed colour, pulsating different colours red,blue,green,violet,yellow virtually every colour i can imagine.I was terrified & i could just about make out a dark or black outline & there appeared to be some kind of structure above the main rectangle. i am afraid that i did not look up for any longer because i was afraid for my children & myself but all i could think was that you [language removed/cms/rjl] are not getting my children(this has really stuck in my mind)i said to my daughter hold onto the pram handle & run with me faster than you have ever run before we have to get away & get home.I honestly do not remember the journey home it was about half a mile to home from where we were & the only thing i can remember is suddenly finding myself at our front door .Shaking all over so much that i could not get the key to go into the lock,i had to ring on the bell to get my now ex-husband to let us in as he was home by then.I tried to tell him what had happened but he looked at me like i was mad really crazy,he said where on earth have you been until 12.30am??That was when i realised that this fairly short journey had appeared to have taken much longer than it normally would.Looking back on it i do wonder if it could possibly have taken so long as i am a fast walker & i do not hang about when walking out late at night & especially with two young children.I asked my daughter recently if she remembered that night & she replied \"yes of course how could i possibly ever forget it!!\"she also said to me that she could not remember our journey home & asked me if i could....It was then that i realised for sure that i could not, this strikes me as being odd but i really do not know if this was due to us being so frightened or really terrified of it & desperate to get away or if for some reason unknown we cannot remember & i do not know the answer to this question.We left home that night at about 10.40pm i know this because we only had about 20 minutes to get there before the shop closed.We arrived home at about 12.30am & this is a journey that would normally take me about 45 minutes tops,but i cannot be sure for how long we stood looking up at the craft....I was so afraid that i doubt it was for very long!!My daughter summed it up the other day she said could we have had some missing time do you think??Of this i really do not know how to answer. i realise that i have left it rather a long time to report this incident but after seeing my then husbands reaction to my tale i thought that if i reported it i would be ridiculed by people & i did not want my daughter being laughed at when at school but also i knew that my marriage was in big trouble at that time & soon after we split up & divorced etc so this kind of took over all of my mind & concentration for a long while afterwards,therefore this whole sighting went out of my mind for a few years.I had another ufo sighting in 2012 & this is what really made me start to think that i should have reported this incident in 2001.Also i told my dad about it not long before he sadly passed away & he said that i must report it some time soon,as he believed that this type of incident should be looked into...I kind of feel that i owe it to my wonderful dad who is now sadly passed on & so i have at last reported it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First of all ,the following account is true and is to the best of my knowledge is the way it happened.  i was in 1972 an airmen in the usaf stationed at keno afs, oregon out of kingsley field oregon. i was a radar height operator during my time there on the mountain. i received orders to go to udorn thailand in 1972. in august of 1972 i packed my family with wife at that time, and young daughter who was born in may of 1971,and a young labrador retriever puppy. we were heading to laredo texas for some leave, where both our families resided and my wife would be living with her parents while i was away.  i was driving a 1971 mustang mach i, and towing a trailer with most of our belongings on it.  i remember we left in early afternoon and intended to stop only as necessary so as to make it home as soon as possible. the labrador puppy had been given small dosage tranquilizer pills by the base vet so as to keep him calm and sleep since he was riding in a dog carrier at tailgate of the trailer. he was very comfortable and i foresaw no problems as long as we kept to our schedule. the baby was fed and asleep in the back seat where we had set up a make shift crib.  at about 2:00 am we were heading west on a long dark stretch of road but could see it was one of those roads that went on forever and then over a distant hill, more highway  if you know what i mean. my wife was asleep when i first saw what looked to be some sort of a road block set-up ahead about a mile ahead. i could see the reflection of the cross stripes on a low wooden type structure, is why i though of it as a road block. but i started to wonder why a road block at this time? i was traveling at about 70 miles per hr. so i knew i would soon come up to it. i woke up my wife to see if she saw the same thing. i started to slow down anyway because i am a law abiding person, used to taking orders. as i got closer i saw no one at the road block just the low road block structure strung across the right side of the highway. i was about one city block length away from the road block and still no one manning it. suddenly our puppy in back started to howl, but not like a puppy howl or yelp, but like some sort of monster from hell and very loud howling and just continued to do so till after we passed this area. all my hair stood up on the back of my neck.  my wife and i looked at each other and i hit the gas pedal, feeling very much in danger. something told me to go and not stop, which i obeyed,  i swept around the roadblock on its left side. my wife and i both looked to our right. there was a strange set up and it looked like three daises raised around a cleared center area, like a basketball court with bleachers but one side missing.  very bright lights illuminated it, one dais was facing south and about 100 ft. across more or less and the other two facing each other east and west about same length and all three connected with the south side open.  in this areas were many men or not, very white in coloring and they were all wearing what i saw was bright blue overalls and scampering around. there were many pieces of equipment around the inset of the dyes but the center part was clear almost like a short runway or large landing pad.  my wife said she saw the same thing except that she saw them wearing white overalls and that they all looked bluish in coloring to her. i looked in the side mirrors and no one was following us. no lights no police , nothing. i was going about 75 miles per hr. sand didn't slow down for at least 30 minutes to an hr. i did slow down though and saw that my wife was still nervous ,but that our daughter was still fast asleep, the puppy was quiet. i started to look for a place to stop and rest, with people around. i saw a light to our right in the near distance just off the highway  so i slowed down and carefully pulled into  what looked like an old style storefront parking area with a light swinging in the warm desert breeze from the store and i remember it even made that rusty sound as it swung back and forth the, i told my wife we would stay here and in the morning we could get something to eat or drink there. we agreed, i remember getting out of the car and i could see the outline of the store front as i went in back and relieved myself before getting back into the car. next thing i remember there was a sharp knocking on my car window. it was a man checking to see if we were alright. i woke up fully and remembered that i felt as though i had slept for a hundred years, the best i had ever felt or since and fully energized and alive. the man was not excited and said he wanted to know how the accident happened? i said what accident? he said yours. he said you are 200 from the highway, sitting in the middle of the desert. i just happened to see you as i was driving by. he asked if we were alright? i looked around my wife was just waking up and my daughter was still fast asleep. i said yes i feel great. i looked around, there was no store front no store sign swinging in the breeze and no store. we were in a clearing off the highway. it was a bright sunny day. my reaction at that time was nonchalant, and very strange when i look back at it. i checked on the puppy, he was fine. the car and trailer looked fine. i looked like i pulled off the highway in a straight line to the position i was found in. i did notice that the truck driver was driving what is typically called an 18 wheeler and that he was parked far to the left on the highway  of where we ended up. i thought at that time boy he must have great eyesight. he said go ahead and pull off the road to be sure the car is ok. as i did this i noticed a bump in the trailer axle. upon further inspection i could see it was bent. i can't think of anyway it could happen unless i pulled off and hit something the night prior, but i remember being careful. i thanked the truck driver without exchanging any information nor did he offer any.  anyway i was regulated to going about 45 miles per hr. till we hit the next town. i am not sure but i think it was mercury nevada? at this small town i stopped at a service station that told me the trailer was ruined and too dangerous to continue with it. being an airman at the time i had little money to rent another one instead i sold some our belongings and gave the rest away along with the puppy to the service station owner. we took it all in stride and just kept going. it only started to bother me years later by 1981 i had divorced my then wife and life went on. but i still speak to her on occasion and this incident does come up and she still remembers the same thing. i did not report this sooner because of my position with the usaf. i later worked in air force intelligence and as a crew member of an e3a training squadron. i then worked for a us government agency where i also feared some sort of repercussions. i an now retired, this happened along time ago. even if it falls along the parameters of the secrets act it has been about 40 years and by now should be declassified.","distance":"21-100

viewed it on a big screen and not my cell phone screen i could see a small flashing silvery-blue light going the opposite direction and faster than the craft it was flying by.  it also seemed to fly in a uneven path and would get close to the craft. well the first light got to the distance where i couldn't see it behind the church that i was at.  i filmed the other two lights as the second light

had passed behind the church so i couldn't see it anymore.  i looked at the third light but my arms were sore from holding the big heavy camera that i finally had to go home.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

as it was perpendicular looking south at approx 45 degrees elevation, i was still expecting something to show as recognizable such as a plane's wings, blue or red lights. nothing of the sort. no sound, just a very smooth floating eastward. we were both mesmerized for about 5 minutes of observing as in disbelief. i unfortunately had the camera tied down and a wide angle lens and realized it would not be a good shot as it would simply show a bright spot. also with the moon having been as bright as it was, i was in denial thinking it had to be some plane. but now outline of wings or tail (helicopter) showed even from the moon brightness. the disbelief was also caused by it flying over a city as it did as in our minds, we truly thought this would only happen in barren areas. i should have know better as i have seen and by accident filmed in time lapse two other events, one in particular over the same mountain range where this one finally dissipated/disappeared from one moment to the next.

1am (the parking spot was all the way in the back along the tree line). i just got out of the passenger side and shut the door and i stood in an open parking spot next to my friends truck and noticed a light coming from the front of the car parked to the right of the open parking spot that i was standing in (my friend walked aroun the rear of the truck and stood about 8' behind where i was standing). all of the sudden i saw an orb of white light close to the size of a volleyball and about as bright at a 60 watt bulb start to move from the front the car to my right and went toward the front of my friends truck, but the made a sharp 90 degree left turn toward me. then the next orb came from in front of my friends truck and made a 90 degree turn to the right and got in line with the one in front of it. the 3rd orb came from the front of the car( parked to my right) and also did the same as the first orb and got in line with the others , the 4th orb came from the front of my

\" what the hell was that \"and he shouted back to me \"i'm glad you saw it\". i could of put my hand out to touch them but i was more curious to see what they were going to do and didn't want to disturb there movement (they move independently from each other but also move in formation). because of how close we were to the orbs i am 100% certain that it wasn't some reflection,  or something

up at first. it was partly cloudy. then the clouds started looking wiered. i looked & looked. there was an invisibility thing going on. it was like the triangle shaped craft itself was invisible, kind of shimmering, but it was framed with a solid row of color changing, very dim lights. it was moving very slow, hovering occasionally heading west. it reminded me of blackout drive in the military. it seemed pretty close. then a white orb came come the south heading north very fast, then it was gone. then an orange orb was coming from the west heading east very fast. at least as fast as a fighter jet or faster. it was blinking on and off extremely fast like it was advertising here i am.\r\nthe triangular shaped craft was still moving slow, but changed direction & started heading north. i ran out to the middle of the yard to get a better look. then i noticed that it had a very dim white light in each of the corners, but the craft itself remained invisible. then it moved slowly into the clouds heading north. i think it may have been an upgrade to the military tr-b3. but there was no big white light in the center of the craft. so, that one disappeared into the clouds. the white orb was long gone. the blinking orange orb was still heading east very fast and was soon gone.\r\nmy feelings were, shock, amazement & excitement all at the same time.\r\nit almost didn't seem real. but i know what i saw.\r\ni was military for 8 years. i've been to a lot of airforce bases & airports.  i'm always looking up. i've never seen anything like this. it was crazy. i had the feeling that something was going on & all the ships had to know each other was there. now that i know what the orbs look like & how the can act, i've seen them several times before. i think everyone probably has &
