rotating lights and stationary lights and it had a front \"windows\" that were dark, i could not see it. \r\n\r\nwhen i looked right at it, it disappeared. when i looked back toward my tv, using my eyes to pan right, it was there again, and of course, whenever i looked at my tv, the stobbing began again.\r\n\r\nafter a minute or so, i got pretty tired of this and yelled at it to leaver if they had no other reason being there than to look. they left after another fifteen or so seconds. \r\n\r\n\r\na dozen years earlier, i came home at 1:30 am. i had left my curtains open and the tv on, intruder discourager, and as i was pulling my bags from my trunk, i looked up and leaning into the window, from behind curtains was a being that looked out at me, acted stunned and surprised and quickly, and frankly comically pulled back out of view. it was metallic, very agile and iridescent, almost opaque.\r\n\r\nwell, i was pretty interested in what was going on, so quickly moved on, into my home, but nothing. absolutely nothing.   \r\n\r\na few years earlier i had a ghostly encounter, but the sprit and i had achieved successful cohabitation, other than she liked to do things to freak-out visitors.  after getting comfortable with this spirit, a few other encounters, but none more with other beings until the \"opaque man,\" and the recent vessel encounter.\r\n\r\nthey seem to have interest in me, but no lost time, so have to believe i have not been taken, and it's obvious, and i have no clear understanding as to why, i'm not fearful. i mean, who yells at a vessel that has pushed through their ceiling?\r\n\r\nno evidence of anything other than the spirits that came through that home. i've moved since, and the primary spirit followed me here. for some reason, it appears she's very protective, but not intrusive.\r\n\r\nbut i swear on the graves of my parents the lives every relative i have on this earth, including my own, obviously, that what i've describe happened

front porch and took a video on my iphone of what i believe to be a ufo. my friend and i were getting ready to go bowling, i had not been drinking and was not under the influence of any drugs. at approximately 7pm est is when i went outside. about 1-2 minutes later i noticed a source of light in the sky partially obscured by a tree. i can't really say how i first noticed it, i was facing that direction and it just kind of caught my eye, and for a split second figured it was an airplane, however quickly realized it did not have the qualities of an aircraft. and in fact very shortly before recording the video i clearly observed an airplane to the east of my location and could clearly see aircraft identification lights (red and green blinking on the wing). \r\n\r\ni was facing wsw towards the object, which appeared to be traveling north. the light was actually two solid white lights very close to each other (sort of looked like car headlights from a distance, though it was way too high to be a car on a hill- there are no mountains in ohio). these lights did not blink what-so-ever, although they may appear too in the video as they pass behind the silhouetted tree branches, i assure you they were very solid bright lights. there was not any standard aircraft green and red lights associated with it either. the lights moved smoothly across the landscape in a straight line until completely blocked by a conifer tree and then houses, which is when i stopped recording. i observed the object for about 2-3 more seconds after the video stops, as it passed between the conifer tree and the row of houses. one of my friends that lives there was inside the house at when i first noticed the object, but by the time i yelled for him to step outside it was behind the houses and out of view. i showed him the video however, and he agreed it was strange looking and likely not a man-made aircraft.\r\n\r\ni was excited when i concluded that i didn't believe this object to be an aircraft, as i am an avid ufo believer, i had seen and reported an amazing sighting from 2002-ish, where myself and 5 other friends very clearly observed a noiseless, hexagonal shaped metallic craft aprox. 100ft in diameter, only about 10 feet above the tree line with green, purple, and white pulsating lights, which very slowly hovered in a single direction until out of view. this was in the day-time and we all saw it very clearly and all to this day cannot explain it and still talk about it often. ever since then i have had my eyes trained to the sky.

was a being of some kind; some grey/human hybrids, greys (some were more brown), and what appeared to be humans. to me, they appeared to be dead. no movement, not even breathing, that is associated with sleep. to my right, a dark skinned grey sat up and looked at me. a slight change in it's face seemed like it was surprised. the grey jumped down from the chair but a change occurred. everything seemed to be become more relaxing. the grey became more lumpy and disproportionate similar to a cartoon character. i had experiences in which \"reality\" was more of an illusion. i asked the being if the first form was it's real skin but i awoke with the idea that i hurt one of them in a panic.\r\n\r\nin 1996, my dad visited germany on a business trip. my mom had parkinson's disease so i stayed with her while he was gone. one friday night in late summer, my mom and i would watch tv once my college classes ended. we fell asleep on the couches. mine was against the wall and my mom was in the other couch next to the wall partition. from my old room, i heard a loud pop sound. out from my room, i seen my dad walk down the hall but his image seemed to flash with the image of a grey. it went to my mom and told her to sleep in her bed, she got up and went to her room. i felt calm despite this being impersonating my father. the being came extremely close me and it asked telepathically, if i seen a ufo complete with an image of one in my mind. i told it that it wasn't my father, he is in germany, and it calmly walked by into my room as i laughed at it. another loud pop was heard and i feel asleep. my mom did confirm it did happen but she died in october 1998.\r\n\r\nthe final occurrence i want recorded occurred when i was 14 years old in 1991. my memory wasn't clear but i remember walking to a ufo hovering a few feet above the ground in the backyard, escorted by a couple greys. next thing they did was asked if i could fix a generator type machine. i said i couldn't to which the responded they had the wrong time period and i was back in bed with a grey looking at me through the window. the greys informed me they are time travelers and i had something to do with their time machines. the machine they shown me was like a barrel with some clear sections. lights of different colors seemed ethereal and i think there are components spinning. i kept thinking about it and time travel. i came to the conclusion that it may have been a type of collider like lhc or a spinning set of devices but to produce a \"black hole\" for electromagnetic fields, higgs fields, and gravity (space-time) with possible the nuclear forces. it's 1950's b-film science but it's the best i could do. the greys imparted a need to figure out time travel or at least be interested. weird but that is what i remember.","distance":"21-100

the back yard where i got my kite stuck in some power lines, i was attempting to loosen the kite with string and rocks, while i was doing that i heard a buzzing (like bees) other wise no sound.When i looked up and this strange looking flying shape shifting object with white and red, blue lights around it \r\nthe white and red, blue lights around it, the center of the craft appeared grayish, off black.\r\nwhat made me first notice the object was a humming and buzzing sound.  i was also looking up to try and release my kite off the power-lines \r\ni first thought it was a blimp because of it's grayish color, but then i looked. carefully, and it was shape shifting as if it were trying to cloak it's  real shape it seemed to be losing power, going on moving real slow in the air, it hovered for a few seconds over the power lines, it almost appeared to me as it was about to crash, but suddenly it continued to follow the power lines to the other end  the motion of the object was slow and steady over the power lines.  i kept watching it in awe. i was incredibly amazed and i kept watching it. this occurred in broad daylight, no one else was outside to witness this object i wished someone else could be seeing what i was seeing  my feelings while i was watching this shape shifting object was of awe, shock, and incredulity. i couldn't really move, i was incredibly amazed at what i was watching. the object just kept flying over the power lines to the other end of the power lines to the other end of the island. i lost sight of the object while i kept my eyes on it until it was too far away to see any longer. it kept following the power lines in a slow motion factor with the white and red and blue lights around it, it resembled to me like a miv shaped brown bag.  very hard to describe due to its shape shifting.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

observing ufo's in this area. thankfully the majority are friendly. i have one who actually hangs out in the southwestern sky on any clear night he can be seen hanging out possibly observing the activity in the area. from local records he has been in the area for at least a 150 years. saterday i took my dog outside to do his business and for those who have seen my previous reports he will actually alert me to the presence of a strange ufo or something going on with our local guy. i think they may make a sound that only a dog can hear. he is not afraid of them, they just hurt his ears. he will usually sit on the ground and whine with his nose pointed to the sky until i look up and take notice of what is going on. saturday he did not sit but did whine loudly just as he got out into our yard and i looked upward at the sky, being overcast it took me a few seconds to locate the ufo in question and it was one of the local lights mother ships, and it was the larger of the two and it was only about the third time i have seen this one. usually it is one of the smaller mother ships that come around and check on things. it was firing in several different directions, straight up, to the southwest and southeast, as well as northwest. it seemed to be surrounded by hostile ufo,s. this was still going on at 10:30 pm when i took for his last run for the night since it was cold he stays inside. i was in a local hospital (non related) for several days and did not return till yesterday. last night i went out with my dog again and the large mother ship was being helped out by several others and were having a mexican stand off with a large dark, unlighted object over my head. they were not firing at each other that i could see, but they seemed to be preventing the other much larger object from leaving the area. on two other occasions i have seen larger friendly saucer shaped objects overhead in simmular situations but they were not present last night. i hope that they come if needed though. i will update mufon on any changes when i able to see them at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":63579,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.67086997136515,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02252015-0010","longitude":-93.8428573886018,"occurred":1421814600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1424914130000,"summary":"Multiple
