trek fan, pretty anyallittical, reasonable, and a respected member of his large community. i've yet to ask him about his siting, because i only found out this thanksgiving, and we were all running around like holiday fools. anyway, over the years i've almost convinced myself it didn't happen. maybe the aliens affected our memory. i don't know, but once i started researching other sitings..I realized i wasn't alone on this. i've seen the same craft on 2 tv shows and numerous pictures on-line. the best example is the craft shown on the \"giant triangles\" episode on ufo hunters, and \"chasing ufos\" in august of 2012. i was calm when the craft was above the trees, but when it shot off...I knew something was coo coo in denmark. anyway, i'd love to answer any follow up questions you may have. i'll send a picture of our back field, and a sketch. other than that, i'd like to know if you are going to use my story on tv etc...I'll keep my eyes on the sky. thank very

south hovering over a treeline in the distance.  i turned left off of 33 and onto butcher road and saw a what is known as a black triangle ufo in the sky.  the craft was hovering and started moving very slowly to the south.  as i got closer it moved over the treeline that is to the south of the intersection of butcher and disbrow hill road.  i watched as the craft made an angular left turn, and then disappeared out of view from the treeline.  it did not appear to vanish or anything,  i just lost it in the trees. the craft had lights on the points of the triangle, which shifted in color from red to white to blue; and had a bright circle in the center (which i assume is the bottom of the craft).  the body of the craft was dark, probably black; and was visible while silhouetted against the night sky.  i put down my car window while stopped at the intersection and noted no noise other than that of my car for the duration of the sighting. i went down disbrow hill road, to perrineville road, turned around, and followed my path back to 33 in an effort to try and regain a visual sight of the craft but was unsuccessful.  \r\n\r\nafter doing some googling, i can attest that this sighting is in line with the many similar sightings that have been reported in the area.  i've noticed that clear nights nights where stars are extremely visible seem to be a common motif. \r\n\r\ni had a similar sighting in the are with another witness in my car about six years ago.  this was the same craft.  i decided to follow and try to get a picture or intercept as i promised myself i would never let something like this go undocumented again.  the first and only other time i saw this type of aircraft was in january of 2009 and it was was in the same area.  (perrineville / disbrow hill road; monroe/millstone, nj).  it should be noted that this area is in the vacinity of maguire afb. \r\n\r\ni am willing to answer any and all questions about this sighting.  i want it to be known that these things are out there.

around 6:50 a.M. in january, it was a very starlight sky early in the morning, i turned off the main road to exit onto the line we were working on, i looked up in the sky and saw a bright light equivalent to the evening star, i said to my worker, there is a ufo, he responded laughing and said he didn't believe in ufo's. within seconds after seeing it, it turned into a light the size of a jet you would see coming in for a landing. we didn't realize the timeframe. it came down at the end of the seismic line, about a mile to about 2 miles from where we were on the line, it stopped, turned and came up adjacent to the truck above the tree tops. my worker, jumped out of the passenger side of the truck and hopped up onto the hood of my truck. i was driving and had stopped, i rolled my window down, and stared at the object in shock. the ufo was a huge cigar shape, there was no sound, the ship had huge big windows all the way down the length of the ufo.  underneath the huge windows, were small port hole windows.  they looked like the size of windows on a 747 jet. the windows were all lite up like looking into a house in the dark with lights on.  remember it was still dark! my worker and i stared at the ufo, but not sure how long it was there, then all of sudden, gently it started to glide away, turned off to the right, had a red pulsating light on the end of it. it was gone in a flash! then my worker jumped off the hood and got back into the truck.  we sat there and stared at each other for a few moments in disbelief of what we just witnessed. he asked me how i felt, i told him i felt like i had just drank a 26 of whiskey and woke up with a hangover, his reply was he felt the same. we both felt physically and mentally drained. we went on with our day,

indicator. a couple of invention ideas, personal difficulties, and a personal note about disclosure surrounds this event. it was january 31, 2015 about 7:30 pm eastern time. while i was lying in bed seriously contemplating moving out of the group home where i live i was looking out of my bedroom window hoping to see something, a sign in the form of a ufo. i saw a distant plane go by and thought well that's just a plane. and i was thinking just close my eyes and go to sleep but i didn't and in about 2 minutes after this thought a dim circular light appeared in the night sky in front of the tree across the street descended straight down stopped and then disappeared by fading out. this downward motion and dim light indicated two things to me. one down with the idea of moving out and second that this idea was a dim idea to begin with.I usually get my messages from the psychic circle but this night was special. this ufo was communicating to me in the same way that my invention idea would have ufos communicating to people out there at area 51 if they purchased my invention idea stardust a non terrestrial magical message board indicator. i have a special symbol that i want to place on the planchette of stardust which looks like a star a toy spinning top and a tornado all in one. this symbol originates from the lines of the palm of my right hand. i consulted the psychic circle about this dim circular light and its reply was as usual far, old, near, and wait other. after about ten years of the psychic circle indicating wait other i finally know who this other person is. i am still waiting(i have been hung out to dry so to speak while i wait) but this person has informed me in the past at the old group home that when we get moved into the new group home things would start getting ten times better for me and they have.\r\n\r\ni also had a precognitive dream about the february first 2003 columbia tragedy with a ufo included in the dream and an actual

keep an eye out for ufo's just for fun. i was looking at three stars and noticed a fourth to the right of the three. as i was walking i thought it was moving but maybe it only appeared to be moving because i was walking, so i stopped. when i stopped i noticed that it seemed to still be moving, in a straight line though. i thought maybe it was a meteorite because it was so far up. it looked like a star, very close to the size of the three other stars near it. they were all white with a tint of blue.\r\n\r\ni watched it for a second over the oquirrh mountains head west and down toward the horizon. within a couple seconds after i stopped i noticed that it abruptly changed direction and went up, complete opposite direction. the it changed again but curved to the right and back down toward the horizon. then it changed again and headed right then curved and went down then curved and went left. then it changed direction again and headed down then curved to the left and curved and started heading back up. it basically traced a three-leaf clover path as best as i can describe it. then it started to change directions rapidly but within a small area, maybe the size of a dime if i had held it up to the sky. it was moving slowly and at a constant pace but kept changing directions quite a bit. once it started doing that i called out to my wife who was just north of me and said \"what the **** is that?!\". as soon as she started to look over to where it was, it headed toward the horizon in a straight line and slowly disappeared. but she didn't see it in time anyway.\r\n\r\nshe said that when i had called out to her she saw a flash in the sky to the north and wasn't sure what it was. soon after the incident, the clouds moved in and covered everything. didn't see anything else after that.\r\n\r\ni'd guess the speed of the object was anywhere between mach 2 and 3 or maybe faster, assuming it was out in space or at least really high up in the atmosphere. i've seen jets go mach 1 and they wouldn't be able to keep up with this object. i'm not sure how it changed direction so often. that's the thing that made me come here to report it. most

west side of town in wenatchee, wa when we saw something moving slowly in the sky that looked like a long red cylinder shaped object that was moving towards us. i turned the car lights off and with that the object continued moving toward us but when we realized that it was something highly unusual in the sky, my friend and i freaked out. we both began screaming, scared at what was coming towards us and i turned the car lights on and a split second later we watched the object that had been coming towards us turn to the side a bit and in the next second it vanished and we couldn't find it anymore. i can't say how close or how big it was but i have terrible eyesight and without glasses on i could clearly see it.","distance":"Over One

miles south of  kadoka,sd and interstate 90. while it was in the late 80's and i was just a kid, me and my family members remember every detail of that night, and to this day still wonder what we saw. it was about 8-9pm mountain time  and we were at one of our home sites on a hill, desolate area. but close to the balkans in the area. we saw what looked like evening stars rising from the badlands/horizon. they were bright like the north start and we thought, why so many. as there were 4-5.As the night went on the lights stayed stationary and the rest of the stars moved on as thru normally did, yet these bright lights stayed in their same area.  after about an hr we realized they were not stars and they were closer to us than we realized.  at this time my older brother decided to flash his car head lights at them, of course his car is facing toward the badlands.  at this time, one of the lights started to come toward us. my mom got scared and told my brother to stop. so he did, but not before the object got about 10ft from us and about 20 ft above us and shining to big white rectangular lights down on us. no noise or sounds associated with it. it was as if it noticed who and what we were and at that moment, shut it's lights off and in seconds, went straight up into the  dark sky and towards the stars, disappearing. yet the other lights stayed on the horizon above the badlands, and just sat there. well by this time my mom makes us all get in the car and head toward our other property about 2 miles west. when we get there we get into another vehicle and go sitting on a hill to watch what the other lights would do. after about an hr after what we experienced at our other property, we witnessed the other stationary lights going in their own directions, some up, some down, some circling each other, and even one displaying multiple lights like a police cars flashing lights, than suddenly disappearing. after about 3-5 hrs of us witnessing these crazy light dances, stand stills, and ascendances, they all just went straight up in to the clear night sky, and disappeared. they would appear and disappear so fast and with no noise, it was like, falling stars, and you could barely track them. it's nite been years since any of my family talked about this, but we all know what we saw and where were saw it. i write only because, after all these years and many of my family living on this land, still no one saw anything like what we saw. our family's have lived on this land for at least  a 100 yrs. but as of recently on the same lands we have noticed military grade helicopters flying around the badlands where we saw the objects , and various off road terrain type vehicles. it now peaks our interest, and maybe you can help with this mystery. thank your you're, time and if i can give you more detail,i would be glad to that. as this land it's in indian territory and i don't understand why the military would be out this way, and if so, for what?","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Other,
