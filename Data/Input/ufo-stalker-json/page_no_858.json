floating object – it was not flying – had no wings, no tail, no rotors. there was no sound, though as far away as it was, even if it had been an airplane i might not have heard it. there was no condensation trail behind it. the movement of the cigar-shaped white object was so slow that it appeared to be simply floating along at perhaps about 30-40 mph. there’s a possibility it may have been a drone – i’ve not seen all the types of drones the military has these days, and there is a base nearby, so who knows? it could have been ours, but maybe it wasn’t. i don’t know. here’s what happened.\r\ni had just pulled out of the post office parking lot on jefferson street in olympia, washington, and turned right (north). after one block jefferson street makes a curve to the nw and as i was looking ahead during the curve (first gorgeous blue sky day we’ve had in a while) a white cylindrical shape in the distant sky caught my attention. as a cloud watcher i am often looking at the sky, and this object caught my attention as it did not look like a normal airplane. it was long, cylindrical, no wings, tail or rotors, no windows as far as i could tell. it was hard to tell how far away it was – i would guess perhaps anywhere from 1.5 to 2 miles away. elevation (guessing again) may have been .5 to one mile high. it’s really hard to tell as there was nothing to triangulate it with. i am a pilot, though i haven’t flown in years, and i’ve sailed across the pacific ocean from sausalito, ca to hawaii, and hiked many wilderness trails alone for up to three weeks at a stint, so i’m used to seeing unusual things, but never anything like this before.\r\nas i was driving on jefferson and it became adam street, i decided to watch it as it was so intriguing, so i pulled over to the sidewalk in front of a yellow fire hydrant (there was nowhere else to park) and watched it for perhaps 3-5 minutes before i couldn’t see it anymore. here’s what it did during those minutes.\r\nfrom my viewpoint it was to my wnw, and was headed south, maybe a tweak to the southwest, moving very slowly, silently, for about one minute of my watch time, when suddenly it veered sharply to its right – due west – so now all i could see was the dot of its circumference. the whiteness of the object was getting dimmer as it moved further west, and suddenly i noticed a bright pomegranate colored flash below it to the south, then another less brilliant flash a little further away, then a third even dimmer and further still away. they were like light flashes, nothing exploding, not flares, and were all in a single southern and lower trajectory from the craft. that was bizarre, then a few seconds later the craft made an abrupt turn and was longwise to my view again, pointing south.  it seemed to just hover there for maybe ten seconds, not proceed further south. then it abruptly turned west again and within a few seconds there was another brilliant flash off the side of the craft – a brilliant whitish green electric colored flash – white on the far side, greener closer to the craft. that flash was fan shaped, different that the burst of round light previously seen.  the fanned-out part of the white-green flash was away from the craft, while the narrow part of the fan-shape was right near the craft. \r\ni kept watching and it got harder and harder to see, as it was moving slowly further away. i started up the truck and drove over to a parking area on capitol lake, got out and continued looking for it, but didn’t see it again. lots of people were out walking around the lake, and after maybe an hour of me walking around it slowly while still searching the sky, i finally got back to the truck, drove to do a quick errand, then decided to drive back to where i had originally seen it. i took photos of the location, made a quick video, got back in the truck and was about to drive away when i saw something that almost looked like the same white cigar shape again – same location in the sky – only this time it was higher and harder to see than it had been the first time. i watched it closely but it disappeared as it headed south much more quickly than the first one – within maybe ten seconds – due to its higher elevation and distance from me – not to its speed, as it was still slow.\r\nthere is an airport to the south of olympia and i frequently see low flying planes coming in on approach, but that flight pattern is different than where these objects were flying. these were too high for approach and way too far west. the best i can figure is they were above west olympia and the southernmost shores of puget sound heading southwest and west which would take them (or at least the first one) over black lake and perhaps on over to the capitol state forest. don’t know what it or they were, but i do know the first one was not a plane, helicopter or any other craft i am familiar with.\r\n","distance":"Over One

memories are photographic and i dislike it - tend to overload on ocassion.\r\n\r\ni was learning how to ride my bicycle when my attention was drawn to a crowd that was gathering at the pool area. it was a normal warm night, very clear. as i walked toward the crowd, the words \"check it out\" were accompanied by pointing in the direction of si bowl, just south of route 13. as my eyes fell on the structure, a white - orange pulsating light, egg or pear shape in form, was bouncing up, down, sideways in the southern horizon like a modern day tracer-light or sparkler that you would use for 4th of july - making shapes. the bottom half would pulsate as the top smaller half remained a brilliant white. to describe it perfectly would be a small group of fireflies, dancing in the southern sky - but 10 times more brilliant. we watched for about an hour until the light stopped in the sky and changed to complete white. it pulsed once and then rocketed straight up and disappeared. i don't recall feeling any fear - a couple of people did run for home. being a child, i felt more puzzlement and awe then fear. having come from a military family, i've seen my share of flight characteristics from aircraft and i know that we still can not duplicate this objects actions today - it simply defied modern physics.\r\n\r\nmultiple witnesses exist for this account. i don't have names to give or the

him stay-over at our house, so i was to sleep at my parent's studio, all this located on the second storey of a 1950's double hight ceiling concrete house, i could not fall asleep so i set up the vcr to watch \"hook\" and about half an hour into the movie out of nowhere the deafening sound of a turbine on top of the house, i was startled, but foremost i was scared, truly scared. first, as i was materially shaking i ventured into the hall by opening the door and was startled by the darkness, pitch black, and the sound was louder, so i shut the door and bolted it, as the room had two doors i locked them and bolted them, then i ventured into the window that was facing the back garden, i opened it and tried to peer up into the night, but as before, everything was black, like tar, i could barely make-out the silhouettes of the trees on the back of the house, what struck me odd is the lack of down-draft that usually comes accompanied by the sound, as with any air-plane turbine, also the sound was deafening, so i closed the window, i wanted to call-out to my mother and father as well as my brother but was too scared, so as i was making-up my mind and building-up courage i sat on the sofa and before i knew i had passed-out, the next thing i remember was waking-up in the morning all startled because it all felt like a second or the blink of an eye, in the sofa and the sheets and blankets had been set-up as in a bed but too perfectly, when i clearly remember that i had them folded right besides me the moment that i sat down to ponder whether i should or i shouldn't call-out my family, i was also startled by the fact that i was lying in the sofa as on a hospital bed, face-up, arms outside sheets and blankets besides my body, wrinkle free. after i woke-up i asked my brother if he had heard anything and he told me that yes, but he was too scared to come out of his room, we have not discussed this events for years.\r\n\r\ni thought this was probably a figment of my imagination but lately, as i live in montreal, i made a trip to mexico on september 19th, 2011 and was singled out by tsa at the airport for a revision, stripped-off every piece of jewellery, coins, shoes, etc. the tsa agent was scanning me with a wand when suddenly at my right foot the wand beeped and made me take my sock off, to his surprise no scar, no marks, nothing, then he proceeded with the rest of my body and precisely on the right clavicle the wand beeped again, he seemed annoyed as if he got me with a chain or something, so he kind of jerked the polo open to find nothing, because i have never had orthopaedic surgery of any kind, scar-less skin, then i could see the fear in his eyes, he just mumbled to put my socks and shoes on and to go without taking eyes off my person, with true awe and fear. i am concerned.","distance":"21-100

degree windows that are 11 feet high i happened to notice just over the roof of the house next door a kite like object floating by. i picked up my binoculars to look at it and was surprised that it had wings that were shaped like bird wings and there were two of them one on either side, the back part of the wings were scalloped, the front part of the wings  i could see it very clearly were smooth. where the wings came together was an object about 3 feet long is my guess and maybe 2 to 3 feet wide and about a couple feet high. i watched it float by thinking it was a kite. i live very close to the bay of newport and i watched it as it was probably 300 to 400 feet off the ground. as it went towards the bridge , all of a sudden a second object just like the first one came into view into my binoculars and shortly thereafter they kept coming in from different directions and at the end there were five of these objects they all looked the same.I watched them for about i'm going to say 5 to 10 minutes until they literally disappeared towards  the horizon to the pacific ocean. they did not make a sound that i was aware of i saw no propeller or any type of engine on them and i believe they were too small to have been a ufo my only thought at the time was maybe they were some type of a drone but they came in from several directions met about two miles past the bridge in newport and went straight out over the horizon until they were not visible.  they were a solid gray blackish color.

planes take off and land all the time. seeing lights in the sky is nothing new in this area because of the airport. at about 8:15 pm on february 18, 2015 i just happened to look out my back window and saw a very bright blinking orb in the sky which was very different from the lights of the planes. it was about 300 meters away from my position, directly in front of me and about a mile up in the sky. i watched this object fly very slowly toward the northeast. it stopped in place and then turned right but only traveled in a southeast direction for a couple of seconds then turned back northeast. it travelled northeast very slowly for a couple of minutes then turned left toward the northwest. it travelled northwest for a few seconds then back northeast. it was either moving very slowly or it was stopped all together, but never moved quickly. after watching this for about 10 minutes it only moved maybe 200 or 300 meters. as i was watching it i noticed that the planes were circling around to the east instead of coming in for a landing, as if they were in a holding pattern. there were 4 planes in the sky around the edge of the city that i could see from my position and they were all following each other from west to east. then i saw the police helicopter with its green light fly towards the object from the direction of the airport. when the helicopter got within 100 meters from the object all of a sudden the lights went out and the object was gone. i didn't see it leave, like there was no streak of light and i couldn't see the orb fly away. it just disappeared. the police helicopter flew right by where the orb was last seen. it flew around in the general area for a few minutes then i didn't see it anymore. a few minutes later the planes started landing again. i was surprised to see all the social media hype about a crashed u.F.O. on an indian reserve in northern manitoba. my husband said i should report what i saw to someone because it occurred on the same night as the alleged crash up north with heavy military presence.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

frightened.  i ask them why they were scared as it was not very close to us. they said it just scared them because it was so weird.  it was indeed, weird. and unfortunately gone by the time i located my camera.  it  appeared to be moving about where i would guess the superfund site is located. over pitcher, oklahoma.  its very hard to judge size and distance but it seemed about 15 miles out on the horizen. the light was solid. it never wavered blinked or acted in any way like plane or helicopter lights. it was truly bizarre. i should have reported this sooner but surely other people saw this. it was so obvious. it was not late at night.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

neighbors trees. the object hovered from behind the trees over my neighbors house or front yard and made absolutely no noise. i immediately took out my iphone and started video taping the object. my cell phone was unable to capture the light from the object but soon after recording my video the object slowed down. right after the object flew away, a loud high-pitched screech is heard coming from the object and it quickly changed its path and flys upwards into the sky and disappears. \r\n\r\n after, watching my video several times, i noticed something that i didn't see in person. right after the loud tone/screech, a caterpillar-shaped object flew around my head. it's hard to tell, but, the object looked like it was about 3-5 inches long and came about a foot away from my right ear. it also was moving extremely fast, faster than anything i could compare too. this 2nd object was only seen for about 1 second and only on camera. i took screenshots of whatever this was from the video i took.\r\n\r\nif anyone has had any similar experiences or could help explain what this was or questions feel free to contact me..I'd really like to know what this was! \r\n\r\n\r\np.S i whistled when

cellphone.\r\n\r\ni have the app loaded because it is interesting and i use a device called chromecast to put live camera feeds from around the world and the iss on our flat-screen television to help entertain my elderly mother.\r\n\r\nlast night, as i was going to bed, i just happened to want to see what the iss hd cam was showing.  and, to my great surprise, i saw ufo's of some sort-- quite a few in fact!\r\n\r\nlet me add that i just sent an e-mail to dr. michael salla of the honolulu exopolitics examiner.  this was because he was the only one i could find that seemed to be a point of contact to individuals that monitor the iss cams (in that he has written about iss ufo encounters).\r\n\r\ni will now share with you, what i wrote to him:\r\n\r\nhello doctor,\r\n\r\ni just wanted to bring to your attention an iss feed that i saw last night that, as far as i can tell, did not make the news on sites, like yours, that report such events.  what i saw was an appearance of ufo's going beyond-- well beyond, in terms of number and visibility of craft, any iss encounters that i have yet seen published.\r\n\r\nthe view is from the hd cam that looks back at where the station has overflown-- the trailing cam.\r\n\r\nwhat you will see is a walnut-shaped, blurry craft maintaining a distance to the iss where no details can be discerned.  this is in the upper right quadrant of the film.\r\n\r\nemerging to the right and left of the center of the frame and level with each other are two, white glowing dots that within two minutes or so, close with the iss to be seen as bright green, glowing cubes.  together and at the same rate and maintaining the same distance from each other, these two craft come somewhat closer to the iss than the walnut-shaped craft-- but not close enough to discern details much beyond their shapes-- which were precisely the same by the way.  there was, i think, a small bright and steady goldish light in the center of each green cube.\r\n\r\nmeanwhile, five or more reddish-brown dots appear, scattered across the top third of the screen.  one of these, near the upper right edge becomes a dim, distant, saucer-like oval that maintains its distance from the iss.\r\n\r\nwhen i oriented my cellphone to try to see the map display and find where the iss was over earth, the two, glowing green boxes had disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe reddish dots and the oval remained.\r\n\r\nat this point the iss cam went off-line and then switched to the forward-looking (bow) cam.\r\n\r\nthere were no unusual objects to be seen in the field of vision of the forward (bow) cam.\r\n\r\nsince your organization seems to monitor these events, i thought you should know.\r\n\r\ni hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\nmark\r\n\r\nnow, let me add a few details that i didn't write to the doctor since i was then typing on my cellphone and that is quite tedious.\r\n\r\nfirst, i think the oval, red disk did move left to right on screen.  and, to describe its color more accurately, since it was sharply defined and not glowing, it was the color of dark red clay.  brownish.\r\n\r\nalso, of the other reddish objects, i think two emerged as two tiny white lights.\r\n\r\nand, as i recall the movement of the iss: i believe it was moving into earth's nighttime zone.\r\n\r\nlastly, my viewing might have started before two am by around fifteen minutes or so since i can't recall if i looked at the time on my cellphone or using a clock that runs slowly in my bedroom.  i was so surprised at what i was viewing, i was not paying as much attention as i should have been.\r\n\r\nthis covers what i saw.  i am hoping that, like dr.Salla, mufon has individuals recording the hd camera feed from the iss.  with luck, you folks at mufon can find and view what i saw.  this is why i am checking 'other' in the 'additional evidence' section of this form.\r\n\r\ni hope this submission is helpful.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
