immediately in front of us. i first noticed these two objects at approximately 9:45 a.M. we were north of georgetown, texas and had just passed exit 268. we exited the highway a few minutes later at

they were perfectly in-line with one another—approximately 3000 feet apart. it’s like they were flying on a stretched out wire—perfectly in-line with one another. they were identical in size, shape, and color. the shape and color of these two objects was contrasted against the blue sky. they were shiny—a bright white. there were no discernable wings, tails, landing gear, propellers, jet engines, windows, or lights. they were two cylindrical cigar-shaped objects with rounded nose and tails. i believe the objects were two-to-three miles ahead of us when i first saw them. they crossed just above the tree line traveling from west to east. they were in my field of view for 5-seconds and traveling at a high rate of speed. i pointed and asked my wife to look out her passenger window to see if she could see what i was watching. she watched the two objects for another 20-seconds until the topography to the east blocked her view. she said the objects did not alter their course, configuration, elevation, or speed—remaining quickly traveling to the east at a high rate of speed until they were no longer visible from her vantage point.","distance":"Over One

but as i was looking away, something caught my eye at 30° above the horizon to the sw, a white cloud; perfectly formed like a disc; angled at 45°. \r\ni pointed it out to my wife who thought it impressively unusual, as well.  we got the kids settled and i decided to go out to the backyard for a better look with the sun setting.  the disc-shaped cloud had not moved at all; not in position, size or shape; and, this was over the period of an 45 minutes to an hour.  \r\ni decided to take some pictures with my old 4s iphone (attached).  for this area, a motionless cloud at that angle for that length of time was, as least in my experience, most unusual.  as i was thinking this, a low-flying jet (under 500') flew right overhead; except it did not go towards the disc-shaped cloud, it headed straight for the horizon - then, it suddenly put its afterburners on - the first time i had seen  that happen in person (it looked like two, close-set fire red eyes heading away from me.)  i did not get a picture of that, unfortunately; but i started taking them soon after.\r\ni decided to move out away from the trees and into the pasture when i heard a helicopter heading for the horizon from the south.  i started taking pictures of the helicopter heading towards the horizon and noticed the flash was on - though i doubt it would light up anything. .  after taking several flash pictures of the helicopter, it suddenly turned and headed straight for me and was getting there fast.\r\nnormally, i would stand out in the open and just watch it fly over - but something told me i should retreat to the cover of the trees; i continued to take pictures of the helicopter, but no longer saw its lights.  the helicopter flew directly over the house, not more than 100' high and it was not a small craft - it was a double-blade sikorsky-type helicopter and it was jet-black and unmarked with numbers or insignias. it was now dark and the helicopter was almost indistinguishable through the barren trees against the sky.  i was really surprised as i was expecting to see an army-green helicopter, not a jet-black one (i thought to myself “no way...”).  i tried to take its picture as it flew over but it didn't take or i missed the button, probably the latter.\r\ni went back in the house and told my wife about it and decided to go to an upstairs porch and look through a spotting scope and binoculars to see if i could see anything; but before i could get focused on anything,  two low flying jets, one a couple of seconds ahead of the other passed by. i decided to go back indoors for the night after that. however, none of the aircraft flew towards the disc-shaped cloud, which remained unchanged in size, shape or position until it was too dark to see. \r\ni cannot say what, if anything, was going on that was ufo related; but it was an anomalous night for several first-time experiences and sights for me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":63502,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.6988243,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02222015-0007","longitude":-97.5925271,"occurred":1422411000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1424598707000,"summary":"Stationary cloud-like disc angled 45°;

remember seeing the bright light under the door and then i'm in my mom's room crying and she's telling me to go back to sleep my dad walked me back to my room and my friend who was sleeping over said she saw something in the neighbors drive way.Next thing i know i'm coming home from school the next day then when my dad got home he tol qd my mom that she should have believed me cause in the paper was an article that said the town about30minutes away saw the same thing i saw. after that she always looked at the sky she wanted to see them too. iwas13when that happened i'm 51now i can't talk

wrote to somebody that was in charge of some ufo report[ not sure which-one it was]the very next day or so while this area is still \"fresh\" the memory of me and neighbors and the surrounding area,, this thing was very low and going very slow when it started moving due north, there has to be many others that seen this thing, i watched it until it went out of sight...When this orange ball was descending from the night sky right in front of me,, you can see everything about this object, it was descending for about 4-6 seconds before these 7 flat bright white lights came on blinking very fast at first and slowed the blinking, but, the light stayed on longer and longer as it slowed down blinking, which caused the craft to slow down until complete stop just above a neighbors house......Ok..Now with these 7 blinking lights that were obviously its brakes for descending or it full propulsion system,,,,,,there wasn't anything that was visible that could possibly have been holding these 7 white lights that blink and slow to a stop a heavy craft,,but there wasn't anything that i could see that would be supporting them,, i had a unobstructed view of this thing that was very well lit-up and it showed on structures on it, it was perfectly round and lit-up with nothing in the light source[as a back lighting, to show any exterior structures,, these 7 lights came on from nothing[ maybe most of this craft is invisible to us,, who knows.....I seen something very incredible and very informative, showing its brakes, so if we can find a person that knows a little about lighting systems that can answer the question,,, what kind of light that is very white and bright and flat[as in there is no reflections coming out at the light source it don't emit any rays out of it, so to the eyes its flat, looking at it from under]....There was no lights see when it started to move..No noise..","distance":"101-500
