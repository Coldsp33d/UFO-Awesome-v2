pure white) headlights came into view ahead, resembling 7\" rounds. \r\n\r\nthey were low to the road, similar in height to a late 90's honda accord, and spaced in a manner consistent with a car. i saw no running lights as one would expect near headlights. they appeared to be approaching at a speed consistent with a car. i hit a slight dip in the road that obscured the position of the headlights for a half second or less, and upon that section coming back into view the headlights were gone. i immediately felt that something was wrong - a car shouldn't have disappeared in a half second. my measurements indicated that the distance between myself and the lights was .2 of a mile, or roughly 105ft.\r\n\r\nif a vehicle was there that had turned, i would have seen the side running lights and taillights. the headlights had disappeared across the open stretch, just inside where houses were placed. upon reaching the point where i saw the headlights, there was nothing there that could explain it. no house lights, no taillights, no running lights, open garage doors, or any movement of any kind. i distinctly remember a road extending from the right side - i saw a sign and everything. i looked down that long, straight road and saw nothing. i checked every house as i passed and saw nothing.\r\n\r\ni was just beginning to tell myself that it was nothing when the lights reappeared behind me in the spot that they disappeared to begin with, roughly equidistantly. it wasn't like a car had turned onto the road, it was like a car had been sitting there and then turned them on. it was immediate. they were much brighter than before, and i immediately felt a visceral terror. i felt that i had to get away from them. i panicked and floored it, hitting 60 mph before turning off at 30 mph. in my car, i can turn off all lights (no daytime running lights, either) and did so while fleeing, hoping that they couldn't see me turn off the road. the headlights were so bright that they illuminated the inside of my car and a 50ft tree ahead from top to bottom. they also seemed to be tailing me from the time they reappeared, maintaining the same distance behind me. when i looked in the direction of the lights after turning off the road, i could clearly make out two shafts of light, coming from the road which at this point was obscured by low-lying crops. i watched my rearview as i sped away but didn't see the lights follow behind me.\r\n\r\ni stayed up for an hour or so more and tried to forget about it. after a few months, having told the story once, i decided that i wanted to investigate it myself. i went back to the stretch of road in daylight with an analytical mindset, and it only confused me more. i tried to pin down the exact stretch, which i knew ended at the road i turned off on, and that the headlights vanished and reappeared in the same spot in the housing area. but the road that went off on the right was a problem. the closest road was too far away, and the distance wasn't right.\r\n\r\nthat stumped me for a while before telling a member of mufon my story when he brought the subject of the paranormal up, and i went out with renewed interest in what happened. i drove up and down the section of road a number of times and located the dip in the road, and i am certain that this dip is the one i remember. it is the right distance from the houses, and there are open fields on either side. there is no road that goes from the right side between that point and where i turned off.\r\n\r\neverything else matches - the houses, the distance, the position of the lights, but it is clear to me that this road i remember isn't actually there. there are no signs that i could confuse for a road sign, and no long stretch of anything that could be mistaken for a road. the road in my memory is a repeat of a road much farther behind the dip, almost as though that was copy-pasted in my memory. trying to fit that road in is what confused me for so long, but now i am confident in the location.\r\n\r\nadd to that that there is no place to turn off right there save two driveways that i checked, and in any case there was no way to obscure a vehicle in half a second there. there is a ditch on both sides of the road that inhibit making such a maneuver. i looked at both locations as i drove by them that night and saw nothing. there is no place to turn a car off and hide it - none of the trees are laying that low to the ground, and no large bushes either. it's easy to brush this off as someone panicking at a car they encountered late at night, and for a while i thought that myself, but upon critically examining the location and my memory i am confident that a car has been crossed out as a possibility. \r\n\r\ni cannot explain what happened, and even when it was suggested that i should make a report i hesitated. at no time did i get the idea or feeling that this was of extra-terrestrial origin. i thought that maybe it was a 'ghost car', but the distinct memory of a road that doesn't actually exist at that location (and yes, i'm sure i was on the same road at the same spot - there are none others like it in the area) leads me to believe that my memory was tampered with. i have talked with a mufon member and have been told that similar events have been reported, so i figured that if anything this report adds another data point to your documentation.\r\n\r\nas a final note, this event has had a lasting psychological impact. ever since the event, if i am driving late at night and headlights appear behind me i slowly begin to panic. it builds the longer the headlights remain behind me, especially if they mirror turns i make in an attempt to loose them. i never had this reaction before the event described above.\r\n\r\nin the attached map, the three white dots are where things took place. the dot on the far right is the dip, where i saw the lights vanish. the middle dot is roughly where the lights were, and where i remembered a road. the dot on the left is where i was when they reappeared. i turned off on the road extending to the bottom of the picture on the left side of the image.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":88529,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.325302803244796,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12032017-0007","longitude":-83.25856714780716,"occurred":1472263200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1512305390000,"summary":"Lights similar to headlights ahead on road disappeared in a half second with no explanation, reappearing behind me equidistantly, brighter than before. lit tall tree and car interior clearly. very clear memory of road feature that does not exist.","tags":["ufo","lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1512355847472,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":30,"maxtempi":86,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":74,"meanvism":15,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":62,"minvism":4,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":30,"maxtempi":86,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":74,"meanvism":15,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":62,"minvism":4,"minvisi":2,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"43040","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":463,"locationName":"Marysville, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7646"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"ALHAMBRA","country":"CO","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Me encontraba con mis dos hijos en el parque jugando fútbol en compañía de otros vecinos, luego compramos helados y nos recostamos en el suelo cuando de repente mi hijo mayor (5 años) y yo vimos una esfera de luz muy alta en el cielo, no le quité la mirada ni un momento entonces le dije a mis dos vecinos que había algo en el cielo, ellos demoraron un poco en ubicar con precisión la esfera de luz hasta que lo lograron. la esfera viajaba en dirección derecha a nuestra mirada hasta que desapareció enttre las nubes.

very faint hum. less than 1 second later i looked north and saw a black triangle, altitude about 500 feet. white circular light in each corner. the dark black triangle was more prominent against the dark gray sky because there was slight cloud cover and the valley is populated and well lit. it flew from north to south. there is some military aircraft seen around here. this was definitely a military aircraft. i would normally have thought... \"cool... they've got themselves a new toy they're checking out at the local test base i think is somewhere southwest of here.\" the only reason this was different was because the speed + size + sound did not compute with my remedial high school level of understanding physics. it flew across the valley in less than 2 seconds. size was probably 40-50 feet corner to corner, 400-500 feet above me, approx 400 mph.  i should have heard or felt something more being so close. the hum was so faint, i doubt most people could hear it. \"stealth\" was my immediate thought. after thinking about it for over a month, i'm also a little ticked off i had to see something like this. i could have lived my whole life happily without this enigma. but i'm

smoke a cigarette i started glansing at the aky just to look at the stars but i saw a couple lights flashing so i thought it was stars but i took my phone out to try n see better and i saw crazy movements so i knew it couldnt b no airplane or jet or a helicopter and it was definitely no star.So i started taking pics and videos. it seems they (extraterrestrials) can send some kind of interference since my camer is clear but when teying to rwcord them or take a pic it gets blurry almost impossible for the phone to focus and get a good image of it.When i came up to the conclusion that it had to b ufos i got goosebumps even when teying to explain to my family i would stutter cause i couldnt believe what i just witnessed.Ao ever since that night i go outside to see the sky and im not gona lie or dont think im crazy but ive been seeing them every night till dis day but on nov 28 around 1am is the best evidence i have yet.I was recording the moon cause i had a strange feeling ao i did and by the way i was smoking a cigarette like i always do late at night. the moon was vreyish bluish like a waining crescent moon and as an 1hr or so passed by it started getting lower and it went from bluish greyiah to yellowish. and im trying to get the best focus on my camera phone and i can see sum objects to the side and infront.So im still recording.And im shaking its hard not to shake or tremble when witnessing this stuff. ita getting lower and more dark orange then i can see how it wasnt 1 big bright light but like a circle with lights over it and around it and it lookes in the video like it sbrinks and then out of nowhere it dissapears.Before it disappeared tho i could see a diamond shadow a little higher which is where thw object seemed to go when it vanished as if it camaflouged or idk.I just know ive been witnessing lots of ufo action and a couple other friends have as well after i told them to pay attention at the sky.Idk why they are here or whats going on but i thought it was gonna be cool seeing a ufo but really its scary not knowing why ive been seeing so many whats their purpose. i may sound crazy cause i know i probably wouldnt believw if somebody told me this but i swear on my sons life that is nothing bjt the absolute truth.The video in youtube ufos in dallas tx nov281am i didn't back it up in my phone n now os deletes i guess but i put sum other pics and videos that i got as well on the pics zoom in and all those things r dem believe it or

was seated in the front passenger seat.  the object was north east of us when we first saw it.  initially we thought it was an airplane.  the object was not far from the highway...Maybe a few hundred feet to the east and a few hundred feet in the air. it had two green lights and one red light.\r\n\r\nonce we got closer we realized it was not an airplane and we thought it was lights on some sort of stationary power pole or something.  we literally drive right by it and could clearly see that it was not connected to anything and was not a plane.  at the point we drive by it was directly east of us on my side of the vehicle.  as we passed the object was between my view and the moon.  i was able to see in clear view that it was a triangle with lights at each point.  i could also see through the object with the help of the moonlight.  it was essentially a hovering triangular seamless peice of glass with lights on it.\r\n\r\nonce we got north of the object i continued to watch it out the back window and could see that it started to move west at an increasing speed.  it was heading west until i lost sight of it as we continued driving north.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend is/was a non believer
