on weekly basis i had nose bleeds, after these events i could not remember anything, i had a short memory and at school i could not remember my subjects, that is my results at school were very bad. my mother always told us about a man in black suit, hat and dark glasses and she found this very strange as we were not close to any towns and off the beaten track. i moved from cape town to croatia

completely, invisible!!! i asked my sister if she had seen the same thing and she said she did. though i find it odd that we never really talked about it at all. really never did. it was real exciting for a very short time and then i really never thought about it again. i didn't forget it, it just seems that it was put in the back of my mind as if it was just every day. strange yes. i think that you are looking in the wrong place. stop looking up so much and find a way to see them where they are. here on the ground. i know they exist. what i saw could not have been mistaken. there was nothing

mentioned a large, dark wedge shaped craft with 5 round white brilliant lights was hovering about 20 feet over the ocean's edge, silent and moving very slowly. it remained in place as long as we stayed to watch- we were there almost 20 minutes. my husband became uncomfortable, so we left. (i wanted to stay and see if they'd take me for a ride).\r\nsince then, the orbs/lights have been a repeated occurrence. on one occasion, my husband observed three humanoid beings surrounded with brilliant blue light come into our room through closed doors. it was about 2 am, he was reading in bed, and i was asleep, and they began to come towards my side of the bed.  my husband \"heard\" one of them say \"he is a friend of ____(hard to understand) we must leave\". then they simply went back through the doors. he got up and followed them, but by the time he got to the living room they had vanished. i woke up as they left the room, but neither of us looked out the patio doors for a craft- we were pretty shook up. the beings have not returned, but the orbs/lights turning into craft have been seen by us a few times since that \"visit\".

remember seeing the bright light under the door and then i'm in my mom's room crying and she's telling me to go back to sleep my dad walked me back to my room and my friend who was sleeping over said she saw something in the neighbors drive way.Next thing i know i'm coming home from school the next day then when my dad got home he tol qd my mom that she should have believed me cause in the paper

and right in front of me,[which is actually 3 houses away from me, but, i had nothing in my way of sight] there was a large fire/orange ball desending right in front of me.. i don't remember just exactly how high it was when i first seen this, very bright object coming down from the sky,,,,,but,, without any warning or anything to suggest that something is about to happen,,,,,this redish/orange ball is coming down from the sky that is about the size of a small house,,when suddenly 7 very white, very bright and ready these 7 very white very bright were also very flat... flat, as in the lights gave no flare or glow or beam, don't know what it may be called when a light goes on and you can see the light filling-up the darkness,,,the ships 7 lights gave off none of what a normal light does when its turned on....Ok,,,ready for this one,,,,,,as this craft desended at one point the 7 lights came on blinking very very fast,,,,,,which in turn caused the craft to slow its decent and the blinking slowed as the craft slowed down, until it came to a complete stop just above a 2 story apartment building.....No noise at all from the time i first seen it coming down , it made no noise..After about 5 minutes this craft moved very slowly but steady due north, into blackstone,ma.As it was moving a niebor was there i showed her and then went in my house and got my wife and son,, at that time this craft was a mere fire/orange ball moving silently north....Ok these very white and bright lights were in fact,, one of its propultion systems...When the lights first came on blincking it kinda blinded my for a second[ kinda like a camera flash]....Me, i have been looking at the sky day/night mostly night time,, since i was 19 years old, hoping to see anything awesome, which i have many times i seen some strange things in the sky, so, when i seen this red/orange ball coming down i wasn't excited yet, it could be anything,,,but when 7 lights come on blinking and slowing down the crafts decent,, this is real living thing controlling that........I will tell you in detail not sure if i forgot anything,, but i will tell the same thing under a lie-detector the best $$$ can get[for real] and if i fail i will pay for the test.... which i really have no money to waste,,and i see the greatest and very imformational ufo sighting in the world......Ok ready for this one... i have wrote this in the nasa data base for reporting ufos 3 times,,,because the first 2 times they were removed from there website...I put it in again not sure if its still there,,,i wrote to a few sites right after the sighting and also wrote it down in a book i have....Also a year and a half ago i go outside my house ,just before dark,, and my son who was outside already tells me he just seen a orange ball in the sky,, and suddenly another orange ball comes out of the clouds, so i get my camera and videoed it,,[i got it on film]]]]and then in july the beginning two more orange orbs are there agin, my son friend got this on film [very good]no idea what these can be there very small mybe a softball  not really sure...Oh, yeah i wasn't the only person to see this in

planes flying overhead. in between my neighbor's house to the west and another house, i saw what i thought was a single gold/copper light coming from a plane headed in my direction. this was not uncommon because it was near an establish flight path directly over my house. i watched it come closer, and it looked like it was gaining altitude. i looked down at the snow at my feet and around my yard for a minute, and when i looked back up at the light it had turned into two lights side by side. it looked like it was still headed in my direction and slowly gaining altitude. the lights did not flash like normal airplane lights, the seemed to almost shimmer like a star. thinking that it was still a plane, and how far apart the lights seemed to be, i thought that the lights represented the end of each wing. it gave it the appearance that it was really close. i didn't hear a sound coming from the object. as it was gaining altitude the lights seemed to tip up and down, like if they were the tips of a plane, that it was having a little bit of trouble staying stable. it was quite windy out that night with gusts of wind. it got so close to my neighbors house that i thought it would make contact and crash. my neighbor's house is only .03 miles away so it is very close. as i watched it, it disappeared from view blocked by this house. i waited a couple of minutes expecting it to clear the house, or crash but i never saw the lights again. again, there was not a

picture of the moon, looked at my screen and saw an object. i looked in sky and saw nothing. i took two other photos, looking to the sky between taking the pictures. i saw the images on my camera, but never saw any sort of twinkle, dimmed light of any source of light other than the moon.\r\n\r\nthe thing that makes this interesting is that the photos were taken above, and at the end of the dobbins air reserve base in marietta. i do not believe these were any kind of distant incoming aircraft. i never saw any lights what so ever. i am retired from lockheed martin in marietta, and have covered the flight line for years. i know, and have been around air planes all of my life. this is the first time i have ever seen anything like these objects on my photos.

plane but there were no tell tail marker lights blinking. i observed its flight path for a time and noted its altitude and speed was well beyond any high altitude plane i've ever observed in the military or commercial flights. also the light began to shift from side to side smoothly and quickly without losing speed as if avoiding something in its path. i kept track of it and called to my roommate to come outside and check it out and she also seen its flight path and pattern of movement and we both agreed it was something more then a plane or satellite. after a rather speedy flight path we lost sight of it off in the distance and high altitude within a short time span. i am a former military flight deck handler on a amphibious aircraft carrier. i have seen a number of flight paths and patterns and planes in my term of military life. i seen what planes  do at high altitudes in all sorts of weather and that night even at that height no plane i've ever seen nor heard of could have moved in the way this object did. unfortunately the event was so short lived i couldn't gather any photo evidence and i doubt anything i own would have been able to visually pic it up well because of the altitude it was seen in the sky. in my opinion though i believe the object wasn't so much in the atmosphere due to the height i seen it at. call it a gut instinct but i firmly will never believe what i seen was a plane or satellite or even space junk.
