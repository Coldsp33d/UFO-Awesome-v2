avid sky watcher and always are outside in the summer time with eyes to the sky. i live in the country so its very visible skies at night time. we have a back deck that holds the bbq and chairs and table we often set the telescope up on or just sit and watch mostly for shooting stars, but after that night it all changed.. we were sitting star gazing as usual for about an hour around 12-1am in the summer time. there was a very low and ethereal like cloud cover that night. you could see the stars and shooting stars through the clouds still. as i noticed something traveling directly overhead traveling n ne in a straight heading at a pretty decent rate of speed. it was triangle or boomerang shape, the best way i like to describe this object or objects as it seemed to be 7-9 craft acting as one, is when geese for a group and fly together in a v but not in perfect symmetry, this is what it looked like. not a sound was ever made, and its very quiet where i live you can hear a car a mile away and planes when their in the sky. this is what made me think this can not be an airplane its not possible as my house is in a direct flightpath to an international airport 40minutes away and i always hear if a plane is in the vicinity, this also was not traveling in a direction or route that is ever taken by other commercial planes. and i caught this ufo as it was directly over my head and i mean directly as i remember my neck was hurting from staring straight up. so i saw this ufo at its closest possible point to me in recollection of where it was at in the sky. it traveled in and out of the ethereal cloud cover so i never lost site of it or them im not sure what the call it. all i know is that its was 7-9 craft that came to form one and each separate one had what appeared to be a light bay or something on the bottom, possibly landing gear i dont know it was big and round in shape. if it was a light it was not on, these ufos had not one spec of light coming from then but still somewhat seem to have a dim faint glow as it made them very easy to track across the sky. the only military things i have ever seen in the area is a helicopter, otherwise its only commerical flights up above 30k ft or local plane owners, none of which ive ever seen a local fly at nighttime. me and my father saw it at the exact same time and never took our eyes off the sky they just had passed over us traveling n ne and watched it disappear over the horizon till it was gone, as it left my sight my adrenaline kicked in as i have always wished to see a ufo as i always thought there is other intelligent life out there, we are all very naive people to think we are the only living being in this fast ever expanding universe, and this only made it easier to feel that way, as ive never seen a man made craft like that, and certainly never seen anything fly that didnt emit at sound at all. so to me i have to believe it was a real ufo and not something of this world, and when i say this world i mean earth, as the universe is our world to, weve just not have the consciousness to believe that yet, or most people dont, we rightfully have a place in the universe as we are born from it as we are born from a womb, thrust from the big bang to finally end up here on this beautiful planet, in which we need to start making changes or soon it will be irreversible. i know ive went on a rant, but people we need to believe we need there to be something else out their you need to open up your mind in able to deal with all of this information and belief and not be controlled or told what is right or wrong to think you have your own minds you need to use them and make your own decision and assumptions in this world. im just a regular guy nothing special, but what makes me special is i believe i know there is life out there the universe itself is so big even with the smallest possible odds 0.0000000001 to the billionth degree idc how low you get there is still at those odds a guarantee that some type of life is out there, and until we find it or it is publicly known my soul will never rest. if i could leave this planet on a one way ride youll be damn sure id be going on that trip, the key to life isnt just being happy its knowing were not alone and there is a bigger reason then just working for a living and making money for us to find happiness we werent built for that. knowing that we arent alone is the ultimate happiness at least for me. the thought of meeting something else weighs heavy on my mind. the knowledge is limitless out there and a concept for us as an alphabet or newtons laws of physics wont apply at other places in the universe, the laws and teachings here are to help us understand in a way that we can and teach it back so we all have a universal language. i want to know of other languages not of the earth kind, their technology and ultimately their knowledge of life. remember knowledge is power, not just from a text book but from life itself, and our meaning of life here will not be the same out there.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

approximately 2h30 in the morning. roughly one week later this incident, i've decided to openly talk about it, even if i don't feel really comfortable talking about it.\r\n\r\ni am a 47 year old guy, living by myself. my house is located in the northern area of sainte-brigitte de laval, a small and calm town located at about 40 kilometers from quebec city. this is a really calm area without any neighbors. it's basically a dead end. the house is surrounded by forest, mainly pines and regular trees. this is not a suburb. this is the woods. the house cannot be seen from the street and there is no street lamps nearby. to reach my house, i need to take my private access road (less than 100m). at night, the whole property is pitch black as i hate leaving the exterior security lights on all night long. since i had bear issues in the past, i installed four motion detection halogen flood lamps that are pointing at each corner. \r\n\r\ni live there alone. my typical weekend night is to watch movies on my laptop computer in my bed. i also drink a few beers, maybe half a six pack. i normally start watching the first one at 9 pm. when i feel like watching a second one, i start it right away. if i don't fall asleep and i feel like it, i'll watch a third one. but sometimes i'm too tired and fall asleep during a movie. that's what happened the night of the incident.\r\n\r\nthat night, i started the first movie at 10:30. nothing unusual. did not feel sleepy at all. the movie ended at 12:30. perfect for a second movie. i started it right away. it was a long movie and if i closed my eyes, i would fall asleep almost instantly. the movie was so boring... eventually i felt asleep for good and woke up during the ending credits. i tried to rewind the movie back to the moment when i fell asleep. but i kept falling asleep and waking up. then i woke up and my laptop has died (forgot to plug it to it's power supply). there was no lights on inside or outside the house so i tried to grab my phone and use it as a flashlight: couldn't find it. then i saw what i can describe as a flash of bright yellow and white light outside the window. my heart started racing because i've never seen lights other than my motion dection lights over there. since my bedroom window is looking at my backyard, this could be a city truck or any truck with rotating yellow strobes. plus i did not hear any sound. i approached the window and looked closer. for a split second, the flash or light came back and all 4 motion detection lights powered up at the same time. i rapidly checked out every window of every corner of the house but couldn't see anything that was moving. needless to say, my heart was beating hard and fast. i went to check out if all the exterior doors were locked when the motion detection lights turned off. checked out the time on the microwave oven, it was 2:30. i could regain my bed and put my laptop aside. trying to figure out what could have caused this, i fell asleep again. i was too tired. then, it happened. i could describe it exactly like when you stare at the sun or a bright light with your eyes closed. you can see a reddish-orange glow even when your eyelids are closed. i was awoken by the bright light that was covering my entire home. my eyes seemed sealed shut but i could see a powerful red-orange glow through the eyelids. at first, i though that i was dreaming so i did not bother opening my eyes. rapidly after, when i began to see dark figures blocking the light for a second or two, i woke up and realized that i was not dreaming and that my entire house was indeed lit by an unknown light source. i could hear what i can describe as a humming noise that i could not hear, much like a vibration my head was picking up. i then opened my eyes and was shocked to realize that there was three short humanoid beings, about 4 foot tall, with big heads, big slanted black eyes, a slit for a mouth and a really thin neck, all surrounding my bed and staring at me. their arms, hands and fingers were long and slim. i was terribly scared, and felt like every hair of my body had risen. i tried not to look at them because their head traumatized me. i couldn't stop looking at them in fear. the last thing i remember is hearing a high pitched noise inside my head and then, nothing, gone, it's the morning already. looked outside and noticed that snow in my backyard is now lower (at least 1 feet).\r\n\r\nmy experience induced me great fear but now i know what many people have been through. i am currently not okay with what happened, so for now i stay in a motel room until i am ready to go back.

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The reasons i waited two years before coming out with my story is that i thought my sighting was a common one. after searching online and looking at many of the pictures i realized my sighting can be absolutely counted in the top five per cent for clarity and for the fact that certainly what i saw couldn't be confused with anything i knew.\r\n\r\nlet's start from the beginning: at the time i was living in the north of watford near a hotel called grove and where from the sixth to the ninth of june 2013 it was held the bilderberg group meeting, a closed-door gathering where prime ministers and tycoons meet every year. i had never seen before such a high level of security and hundreds of police men gathered from all around england to patrol the area. i remember an helicopter day and night flying over the area, even weeks before. a metallic fence was built all around the hotel and an entire road was closed, forcing the people living there to go to work with the passport.\r\n\r\nwhen the gathering finished all the security shutdown completely in just few hours. it was one of two days after the end of the bilderberg that i had my sighting. it was about ten o'clock in the evening, and the bedroom's window, facing the other way of the hotel, was open. a light brighter than the stars captured my attention and i started looking more closely to try to figure out what it was. then the light became brighter and brighter, moving toward me, until i clearly recognized a disc shaped object completely black with the light all around. i couldn't explain how the object could still be so dark, when it was completely sorrounded by a light. it was like if the center of the object was not emitting any lights and that didn't make any sense to me. \r\n\r\nbut even before thinking this, my first thought was: then they really exist! and they are really like they have always been described!\r\n\r\ni tried to reach out my phone with the eyes fixed on the object. but i didn't want to loose any seconds of a so important moment, and then when it started moving away on my right i realized it was too late for a shoot. it drifted away slowly and it took more than 30 seconds to disappear. \r\n\r\nwhen it was closer, i didn't hear any sounds coming from the object, but the details were so clear that if it had been an airplane i could have clearly seen the windows. however the shape was solid black and i could only recognize it because of the bright light around. it was like a disc with a sort of bump along the lower side and a dome on the top of it.\r\n\r\nafterwards i thought it could have been a drone, considering that the bilderberg was held the days before. i googled extensively about all the types of drones, but i couldn't find any that could explain my sighting. i also couldn't find any reports in the local news. however when i searched in youtube words like \"bilderberg\", \"watford\" and \"ufo\" i could find a video about drones. so it looked like drones were deployed over the area, but they were so different from what i saw that i simply ignored those videos.\r\n\r\nnow i often feel angry for the biggest error in my life: not having been able to take a picture of what i saw that day, and for not being able to talk about it without being considered crazy.\r\n\r\ni hope someone can give me some more information about similar sighting. i'm not interested in other types of ufos, lights, strange objects. i wanna only have some more context about that particular kind of disc shaped black objects.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional

again in 2010 or 2011. the first time i was with 2 friends, during my senior year in high school. we were sitting on my folks deck behind our house in sedalia, mo. and saw 3 orange lights of in the distance to the wnw, in the direction of whiteman afb. they were just hovering or stationary. i asked my pals if they saw them and they both said yes. we watched them for a minute or two and with no movement assumed they were related to the afb somehow and didn't really think about it much. however, a few minutes later, they were still there and as i looked at them again one of them moved what had to be many miles, to the south, in just a milli-second. it stopped dead and hovered again and i yelled, did you guys see that? they did not but when they looked they too saw that one had moved significantly. as we watched again, it suddenly , and just as quickly went back to the north to it's original position. then , they all 3 rose what seemed to be hundreds or thousands of feet straight up, hovered once again for just a few seconds, then absolutely vanished to the north in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nnow, being in high school, in the 70's, and yes with a few beers in us, we knew no one would ever believe us so i/we kept quiet for many years. i always knew what we saw but just never told anyone and basically just forgot about it and put it behind me.\r\n\r\nthen unexpectedly, one night at a baseball game my son was in, in green ridge missouri, in 2010 or 11, i saw them again. the exact same orbs, in almost the exact same places. this time there were two south of the afb and one to the north, once again hovering. just as before, suddenly the two to the south joined the one in the north in what seemed to be just a second or two. they then hovered together for a minute or two. as i watched and remembered the first time i saw them i expected them to repeat the events of the initial sighting. but, instead they appeared to slowly move directly over the base, stopping several times and hovering, then after just a minute or two, once again rose straight up seemingly hundreds or thousands of feet, hovered for just a few seconds, then just like the first time, disappeared in an instant to the north. i was astonished. i do not know if anyone else saw them the second time as i was a few hundred feet away from the ball field where most other folks were, having a smoke. i was looking west and the ball field was behind me with the bleachers facing east. i'm don't know about others but i do know what i saw. i am convinced that whatever they were, nothing at that base is capable of doing what these orange orbs did. i have lived in this area for 45 years and know all to well what the b2, stealth fighters and many of the air forces best and most secret jets look like and these were way beyond anything we normally see in the skies around here. i hope this helpd in your quest for answers as after seeing them twice, i am a true believer and no one will ever convince me otherwise. thank you, [name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

did at the time think it was something other then a normal plain or helicopter and thought it might of been a helicopter with a noise suppresser or something like that because there was no sound and it seemed like it was directly over me. but it seems as thought i just shrugged it off. that is not like me. i do remember asking him if he saw the light when i came to his stand to get him and he

of unusual sightings the newly formed emo search and rescue team along with rcmp from 2 detachments totaling 30 people converged on a reported sighting in a farmers field with snow mobiles and rcmp cruisers. with all vehicle lights off the large disc shaped object would approach and hover when vehicle lights would be turned on it would rapidly turn at extreme angles as if to avoid the lights. with lights off it would return to a position. the next day a tv news crew came out for interviews. the same object was seen earlier over fort quappelle by aprox. 150 people. this was also covered by local papers.\r\n\r\nwhen i was first told this story was 1979, and had seen a few blurry pictures and then had an opportunity to talk to 3 witnesses. then there is the rest of the story. \r\nan old truck that got buzzed by the object its fuse box melted. there was appeared to be a landing ring outside town 6 years later nothing grew in along the out side of the ring for about a foot. there were several focused pictures and signed statements as well as debriefing reports in the rcmp file. several years after the sighting when the file room was to be updated and moved 2 people who knew where the file was kept noticed that it was missing. the entire contents gone. local speculation was that one of the constables present kept getting promoted quickly and that everyone else was getting one bad transfer to another.\r\nthere were mention of stress related behaviors. rare disorders (in hind sight) and a attempt to have the incident forgotten by what ever means necessary it took a long time to get some of the witnesses to even acknowledge they had seen something. one witness did say the rim of the disc was ringed by lights sometimes flashing sometimes rotating at one point it almost looked like a second ring appeared below the first, but wasn't absoluetly sure. what he was sure about that was that there were objects that appeared like port holes and one of the men thought he saw movement. \r\nthis was a spike in activity and every few years since, reports of sightings cattle mutilations or crop circles keep being reported in an area within about 70 km from here.  \r\n

around 12:30 i say 3 seprete strange light not far from me, over my neighbors house on bell rd. so as i was looking at the nearest one to me i didnt know what it was it would turn on a very bright light on shinging down to the ground then the light would go off. then moved about 50foot or so to  the north then light would come back on again like a 16 year old kid that i was i wondered what could that be it didnt make any sound and had blinking lingts going around it. i had a kerosene lantern in my one hand and a shovel in the other hand. so like a dummy i started swinging the lantern around and around trying to get attention that is when it came my way .Right over the top of me , scared me so bad i took of running and dropped my lantern in the water and my shovel too i made it about 30 feet when that bright light came on above me. ill never forget that bright light . then as this may sound odd, all the grape vines were going strate up, i grabbed the grape stump and post and wraped my leggs around it as well as my arms and hung on . it felt like as trying to pull me up. thats all i remember, the bright light went off and the grape vines stop going up and came back down i let go of that stump and ran as fast as i could from what ever that thing was, across the back side of that 100 acre field to my house, i woke up my mom and dad, but they didnt believe me. it was very hard for me to go back out in that grape field and finish changing the water that night , but what i cant figuer out, it was 1:00 am when i woke up my mom and dad?
