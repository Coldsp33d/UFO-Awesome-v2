an outing. first off, let me advise we did not see an object...But what happened, has not been explained satisfactory to any degree...And something big happened!!\r\n     anyhow, as we stood in the kitchen of our home, the lights flickered throughout the entire house. they went completely out for about 3 seconds, back on again, completely out again for about 3 seconds, and then a very brief out again and back on. at the time, i thought nothing of it until i seen a post on facebook from our local news station wave 3 news. \r\n     at 0154, they posted \"reports of power outages and lights flickering near lower hunters trace. what are you experiencing?\"  first off, this area is located in kentucky. no where near where i am located. \r\nalso, it is not on the same power plant, lines, or grid as my area.          \r\n     louisville and the surrounding areas in kentucky are supplied by the massive lge and ku companies.  while i receive power from a rural co-op located in hamburg indiana. i opened to comment that we had experienced flashes in borden as well and was stunned at the comments that came prior to mine.\r\n     there were reports not only of power outages and lights blinking, people reported that their cars stalled on the highway requiring them to restart the vehicle.  although there were over a thousand comments, i seen no less than a dozen reports of vehicles stalling, headlights dimming, and the radio inside of the car going to static.\r\n     shortly after all of the reports started coming in, i began to notice the widespread area over which these reports were coming in. as far west (of those who reported issues) as corydon, indiana and brandenburg, kentucky.  as far north as columbus, indiana.  as far south as elizabethtown, kentucky. and as far east as madison, indiana and carrolton, kentucky.\r\n     further, one person commented and posted photos of a field fire caused by a transformer blowing at a substation (in kentucky)managed by lge.  lge issued a statement that the problems and outages were caused by this blown transformer and subsequent fire.  quickly most everyone (including the media) dismissed all of the electrical issues on this blown transformer and went on.  the rest of us,...Not so much.\r\n     although the transformer could have caused the problems with electricity in kentucky, it would have zero effect on the power of indiana residents and even less so, the electrical system in a vehicle, or a radio signal.\r\n     those of us not so quick to dismiss, know something big happened. we know it affected houses, airports, cars, and we believe that whatever happened...Caused the transformer to blow.  however, we do not have answers even though we searched. solar activity was low, so the possibility of a flare was ruled out.  we were left with debating only 3 possiblities; computer hack, an emp; extra-terrestrial interference. \r\n     i don't know if anyone witnessed anything in the sky that night, but i do know a very widespread area experienced (a very scary) a massive electrical disturbance all at the very same time.  i have included a map that shows the locations where people experienced issues. the locations were pulled from the people who commented in response to wave 3 asking if anyone else was experiencing outages and flashing lights.  the reported locations are notated by the red stars. \r\n     now mind you, this wasn't just a few houses with a flicker in the light bulbs, people commented they seen all lights go out at standiford field airport in louisville, kentucky, all lights going out in a hospital (she didn't list which one), all lights going out in an entire amazon warehouse in jeffersonville, indiana, all lights on the kennedy bridge spanning the ohio river blinking out, peoples cars stalling (who were 50 miles apart) on the road.\r\n     i am writing you because this was dismissed as a tranformer blowing \"equipment malfunction.\" there is no way that this was the result of what everyone reported.\r\n\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":63407,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.2611047,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02182015-0001","longitude":-85.7499957,"occurred":1423991100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

flights that would eventually land me in london. it was a work trip but we had a little time to get acclimated. a day or so. a vendor was taking us out on the town on our first night there to an argetinian restaurant; goucho grille. after dinner we hit a few bars and i was taking as many pictures as i could. most of them without flash and trying to keep a steady hand of my camera. it was not until i was back in the u.S. about a month later that i realized that i had captured something rather interesting. and it wasn't until last week when i saw the episode of hangar:1 that i thought about sharing these pictures with you.\r\n\r\nof course, by this point investigating them is out of the question, but what i realized while watching the show is that my pictures may very well corroborate someone else's account of the event.\r\n\r\nthe full album can be seen at the following link: [link moved to fi section/cms/tg], however, only the two pictures i am attaching are freely usable by you.\r\n\r\nif you do use my pictures, all i ask is you let me know the episode.\r\n\r\nthank you all for your research and the time you put into trying to find the truth!\r\n\r\n-mauricio\r\n\r\np.S. i do apologize i can only send .Jpg format. i was using a work laptop while on my trip and picasa automatically reformatted them to .Jpg rather than the .Raw format i had them in which would have been much easier to enhance. the images have not been tampered with in any way, i downloaded them from the above album just minutes ago which had sat undisturbed since shortly after my trip. they do contain all proper xif

driveway and stopped his car up by the gate approx 300 ft east of the house. he sat there bout 10 minutes or so. i thought it was a bit unusual but i have seen him drive past the house down into the pasture checking out deer or coyotes etc. so i didn't think much of it. after a bit he came into the house and said, dad you  need to come take a look at this; so i got up and we went outside. he pointed to the south of the house and about 300 yards or so away were 2 objects, one a diamond shaped object about 300 or so feet above the ground and the other a thick donut shaped object about 150 feet up and maybe 100 feet west of the diamond shaped object. both were a dull orange color. the diamond shaped object seemed to \"sparkle\" while the donut remained a dull orange the entire time we observed it. i went back into the house and grabbed some binoculars hoping to see more detail but they just made the objects brighter. after approx 10 minutes or so we noticed the larger object, the diamond shaped one, started moving very slowly to the east. soon it was behind the trees. at that time we moved to the front or east side of the house. we couldn't see it at this point but could see the glow behind the trees so we moved out by the road in front of the house just as the object moved east out of the trees. as it moved across the road it started to rise. by the time it had crossed the road it was maybe 700-800 feet up. it sat there maybe 10 minutes or so. at this point we noticed a plane maybe 5 miles or so east of the house moving north to south and it was at this time that i noticed we could hear the plane but there was absolutely no noise coming from either object we were looking at. the donut shaped object had not moved at all. after about 10 minutes of hovering above the trees east of our county road the object started moving east again climbing to about 1000 ft then it started moving north, climbed to about 1500 feet, and started flashing lights and we watched it move north til it was out of sight. the donut shaped object never moved at all and eventually seemed to fade away. after a few more minutes we went back into the house. the diamond shaped object was maybe the size of a 727 and the donut shaped object was about one third that size.  i spent 27 years in the military and have lived all over the world  i was part of the 3rd marine air wing and so was around aircraft most of my life and i have never seen anything like what i saw that night.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

celebracion de un cumpleaños de una amiga en el parador figari de playa honda de malvin es que se sucedió este avistamiento osni perfectamente visible por todos quienes alli estabamos y que tambien pude corroborar minutos más tarde por personas ajenas al evento pero que se encontraban en las cercanias. era una espestacular noche de verano con un cielo totalmente claro y despejado y con una luna muy reluciente que a esa hora se ubicaba a nuestras espaldas cuando logro divisar sobre el horizonte en dirección sureste una especie de pequeña nebulosa blanca que me llamó la atención por estar el cielo totalmente claro y por la intensidad del blanco para ser una nube vista en horas de la noche. quienes conmigo estaban le restaron importancia al principio y desestimaron mi apreciación manifestando de que de una nube se trataba, pero la misma comenzó a crecer de tamaño y a ganar en altura y a medida que lo hacía comenzó a hacerse más luminosa en su núcleo y el alo circundante por momentos tomó forma de un espiral abierto para comenzar luego a decrecer paulatinamente pero nunca en su totalidad, por supuesto que de ahi en más comenzó a captar la atención del resto de las 5 personas que conmigo se hallaban y también de otro grupo de personas en el mismo lugar pero que no estaban en la arena con nosotros sino que estaban parados en la rambla misma según después me enteraría y desconozco si alguien más pues había gente desconocida para mi en los alrededores. cuando este fenómeno toma una altura en la que era necesario que elevaramos la vista es que se se pudo percibir una pequeña luz de color plateado verdoso no intermitente en su núcleo lo cual llevó a alguien a sugerir que se trataba de un simple avion y que el mismo venía en nuestra dirección por lo cual ya podríamos en breves despejar nuestras dudas. estoy acostumbrado a ver todo tipo de aeronaves y sabía que esto no era nada visto por mi anteriormente y que no estabamos viendo una luz roja intermitente sino que de a ratos lo que apreciabamos era el brillo de algún material metálico o simil debido a que la intensidad del mismo no era muy alta. conforme pasaban los segundos me dí cuenta de que el objeto no venía en nuestra dirección como aparentaba sino que estaba en ascenso pero la perspectiva del lugar en que nos encontrabamos había llevado a mi amigo a hacer una conjetura errada. durante esos escasos dos minutos (a lo sumo tres) que habrá durado su ascenso se logró ver apenas tres o cuatro veces ese pequeño reflejo que se asemejaba más bien a la luz de una estrella de baja intensidad, por supuesto que siempre recubierto de esa especie de nebulosa que fué disminuyendo en intensidad conforme ganaba en altura hasta esfumarse por completo y de manera abrupta al acanzar la atmósfera. debido a que en la orientación en la que el fenómeno comenzó a manifestarse emergiendo en el horizonte no existe posibilidad alguna de existencia de tierra y se trata de mar abierto es que hablo de avistaniento osni, este es un hecho donde el objeto en cuestion salió del mar para ascender hasta desaparecer por completo al abandonar la atmósfera terrestre, algo que nisiquiera podría igualar un misil disparado por un submarino o buque en altamar. minutos despues de lo acontecido me encontré con una pareja desconocida y ajena al evento en el que me encontraba que también observó lo ocurrido mientras caminaba por la rambla de malvin, y por la muy clara visibilidad de lo ocurrido en una noche como esa en el paseo preferido por la mayoría de los montevideanos es dable de esperar que aparezcan más testimonios e incluso algún documento de lo ocurrido, pero hasta el momento no he podido encontrar nada en la web por lo que gradecería ser notificado de cualquier novedad que puedan tener al respecto, desde ya muchas gracias.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":63400,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-34.9011127,"location":null,"logNumber":"UY-02172015-0015","longitude":-56.16453139999999,"occurred":1359286200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Montevideo

bright light to my right. as it came into view above the subdivision, i asked my girlfriend to stop. she stopped momentarily and i put the window down and stuck my head out to get a look and listen. it was completely silent and motionless hovering above the houses and trees at the top of the next hill (maybe 500-600ft) it looked like the top of a sky scraper with all the metal boxes etc turned upside down wrapped in  a protective railing or fence with antennas and rods sticking out. it was surrounded by a ring of lights all facing the ground. the object above it was dark, the underside lights made it look more dark i'm sure, but i could not see the edges although the darkness above it kept the bright lights from going any higher than where they shone from. also the clouds were not lit from the bright array so the object blocked the light. (the city of mundelein directly to the north showwed the light reflection from its own lights above it very clearly, this was black above it. the superstructure with its boxes,antennas,lights,etc was at the center bottom of a huge black mass that sloped up on all sides. my girlfriend was fighting with me so she did not want to stop and look at anything, she yelled at me \"its a billboard!\" and pulled onto midlothian road. i watched the object as long as i could untill the road turned and it went behind the trees and other obstructions. we returned to my house about an hour later because i had to sell a piece of equipment. the object was nowhere to be seen at that time, but the image has been stuck in my head ever since. i painted a picture right away although it doesn't have all the detail in the superstructure, it captured the basic image so i could show people what i saw. in the map photo i attatched it was above the circle drive to the right of the oval park in the center of the photo. i will try when sam calls back to get gps info, not sure how to get this off of google earth.
