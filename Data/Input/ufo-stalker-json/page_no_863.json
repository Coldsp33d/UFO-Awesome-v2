front passenger seat, we stopped on the rod on the coast and i saw the light, it appeared over the ocean but not to far from the coast (a couple miles at the most)  i kept observing to make sure it wasn't a star, i observed the same degree that the object was at, 360 degrees, and their were no stars out besides less than a handful barely visible clustered straight up in the sky, not even close to the object. there was a little cloud a few degrees under the object and i tried using it as a still point to observe and see if i could notice the ufo moving. the ufo appeared to be moving extremely slow. when i squinted my eyes the outline appeared to be a sliver type shape vertical with the ground. i kept trying to convince my friends that it wasn't a satellite, because i have observed many before. and since the first second i looked at it,i couldn't look away. it brought an amazing sensation to my body just to look at it, the same sensation you would feel if you felt love,joy happiness, and content all at the same time. its as if my eyes were glued to the object. i didn't even look away until a building blocked my view of the ufo while we were leaving front street (the coastal street). now i with all of this information, it is easy to infer that i could have been looking at many plausible things but here is where it gets weirder. a few hours after we saw the object, during the middle of the night(somewhere around 3 am) there was an exremely bright flash in the sky. and many people saw it, and a great amount of people from my area were posting about it all over social media websites. the flash was so bright that it lit up the inside of the house i was in and there was only a small window that was not covered by blinds. my friends said they saw \"lightning\",(take note that i went outside right after the flash, and there was absolutely no clouds in the sky besides a few extremely small dissipating, barely visible clouds in the sky. this event took place sunday morning february 15th 2015. this is 100% truth and honesty.","distance":"Over One

it was 9:05 pm because i looked at my watch when i spotted the object.  my dog, on a long leash, stopped to sniff some bushes and as a few stars were starting to appear in the sky i looked up.  i noticed this very bright light about 80 degrees above the eastern horizon.  my first thought was that it was the space station, as i have seen it about this time of night three times this year.  as i watched i expected it to move as the station moves, but there was no movement and it was brighter than i have ever seen the space station.  i next thought it might be venus, but even venus is not this bright and it was in the wrong place.  after 3 minutes of watching my dog wanted to go so we started walking.  we had gone about 50 feet when she stopped again and i looked up to see the bright light, it was gone.  i scanned the sky and picked it up traveling at a high rate of speed to the southeast.  it disappeared in about 2 seconds above a high cloud deck on the horizon.  i was amazed that it was just as bright when it left as it was overhead. the illumination never varied so it was not reflection of the sun. i don't have any idea what it was but it was not an aircraft as it sat in one spot for at least four minutes and than streaked out of sight in seconds.  i have seen many strange (explainable) things in the sky, but this one leaves me baffled.

intelligently guided objects. they flash rapidly with a bright light seemingly \"skipping in time\" surrounded by a ghostly blue or yellowish glow that i can \"see\" somehow through things like mountains,walls,cars,people,etc.. this blue or yellowish \"aura\" also leaves a ghostly glow trail behind. some are red or white definite points of light and can be seen as a black or dark circular dot in the daytime. they seem to be much further than any plane and can zip across the entire sky in seconds. they move so fast at times they resemble a computer cursor with the trail effect on. sometimes i'll see a flash of light like a beam emitting from them that actually looks like its reflecting off the clouds, this to me would surely be visible by anyone i thought to myself but no one else i try to show can seem to see them! how can this be? it is my own strong belief that this  is directly connected to my consciousness \"awakening\" so to speak because of the fact that others cannot see them and i can also see them through things. they are most definitely there and they are literally everywhere. i even witnessed one disappear in a bright flash in which the color of the flash was different than that of the object. it smashed into this burst of light an vanished. i can see some kind of energy field around everyone of them that resembles an atom. a little point of light zooming around the object in a perfect orbit. i also see this energy when i close my eyes. its almost as if they appear holographic like they occupy a different dimension. a dimension in which they have obviously conquered time-space in order to \"move\" like that. this new sight has changed my entire belief about the reality that we live in. frankly i am quite shocked. i don't know what to do about it. this is something profound. please help me understand this. i am very concerned and i want to seek the truth for everyone to know but i do wish to remain anonymous as to not draw any negative attention towards me for obvious reasons. please use my email for contact as this is the only real info about me listed

san clemente's in yard. heard sound like quick jet powering down looked up to see bright white glowing almond shaped craft speed by moving toward ocean, white globs seemed to be dripping from rear. stopped and descended over houses by ocean. my sister heard but didn't see stand our ears popped. was about 2 in afternoon on 11th. next day i was on patio my home anaheim around 4:30pm reading. heard a rushing sound, loud,confused as it sounded like monorail sound and looked up to see huge glowing bright white object like monorail charging across sky quickly disappearing into hole which opened up in sky in front of it. i had good look at it as it entered like a snake into the opening. noticed it was grey like a matched the sky and was transparent. the craft was transparent with a square opening in the rear and could see the clouds or something smoky lingering in the back and could was swirling right through the skin. looked like the skin of craft was fabric like but mesh and the craft curved like a train entering curved tunnel. also it had long shiny metallic appendages in back on both sides like hughes silver talons. i couldn't believe my eyes and was bewildered to say the least. moments later it was dusk, and white clouds had formed suddenly. the craft was slowly floating east and was huge and glowing as bright as the moon and looked like a gigantic shark with huge fins crossing the sky slowly. clouds covered it then it appeared over the weird cloud layer but stationary like a rocket ready for blast off. it moved down where the bottom of the rocket hung below the clouds momentarily and rotated back and forth as if was periscope scanning sky then moved back up to stationary position. clouds covered it and when they cleared it was gone but could see plumed shooting up like it actually had blasted off. was a clear evening with full moon which was as bright as there craft. for two days following kept seeing what i describe as cloud makers. square type dark clouds with round extension like satellite dish which seemed to make cloud cover. saw round lighted craft moving around here and there in same area saw monorail thing but they were small and seemed to be searching. got frightened and moved into the house. was late afternoon still light out and was sitting in a chair looking out slider when quickly a dark helicopter rushed overhead and remarkably stopped on a dime over neighbors rooftop right in front of my patio. i live upstairs by the way and have a great sky view. i couldn't move. just stared numbly at this close helicopter which had two men in it. they had sunglasses and just starred right at me. it was so unreal how it appeared and stopped so quickly and at rooftop height. in a neighborhood. and starred while they seemed to be deciding what to do about this. i was terrified but frozen. just look right back at them frozen. just as suddenly they shot off. i did not have a computer until now so didn't try to report it then. also you feel foolish. however i am now and been so curious to know if people report many from my area and especially around the time of my sightings. i drew diagrams of it all right away so i wouldn't' forget details. i so look forward to your reply. thank you very sincerely, elyse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

florida, an unusual object high in the sky to the northwest. i followed it with my eyes and was puzzled by the fact that it moved smoothly along like a high-flying plane, but it seemed to be spherical in shape. it shone brightly like a plane reflecting light, but the shining was constant. i rushed around to the front of the house to watch it as it proceeded south, but by the time i got to the front street it had seemingly disappeared from the sky (although i could see the entire area of sky where the object had been headed. then i spotted another object of the same kind (my guess is that it was not the same one) far to the east, over the coastline or the atlantic. it glided south in the same manner as the first object. soon another shining object of the same kind appeared over the northern horizon. i pointed the objects out to my neighbors, who were now arriving in a truck. for the next half hour we continued watching these spherical objects as they appeared and proceeded southward. it would take each object about five minutes to pass from our view (disappearing after moving past us and going some distance. in the course of 45-50 minutes, we saw approximately 9-12 of these objects. there were no sudden maneuvers or changes in direction, although one or two of the objects veered slightly to the east, heading out toward the ocean. some of the objects seemed to disappear (although i cannot say offhand whether that might have been due to the interruption of light reflection). the day was bright and sunny, with only a few thin, cirrus clouds in the sky. air force jets leaving white contrails seemed to be tracking the objects, flying due south along the eastern coast of florida in the general direction of miami. the jets would appear from the north and pass silently overhead at high altitude. \r\n\r\nother witnesses included my wife and four neighbors: a ship captain, his wife, his granddaughter, and a middle-aged male neighbor. we tried to take photos with my wife's iphone, but the lens doesn't appear to have captured anything other than blue sky.\r\n\r\nmy immediate impression was that the objects seemed to be carried by a wind current and might be some sort of balloons. i phoned the local airport control tower (pbi), the coast guard, patrick air force base, and nasa. a nasa employee told me there had been no launches of any kind that morning.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
