computer when the power went down.  i looked out of my office window to see if the rest of the neighborhood had been affected by the power outage. it had. and the entire area had become very dark.  there were no stars visible through the window so i assume there was cloud cover. \r\n\r\nalmost immediately i observed lights coming over the hilltop just north of my home.  they were flying low so i thought at first it was a helicopter.   they were configured in a circle, 12 to 15 oval shaped lights that emitted a bright, slightly green, mostly \"pale\" yellow light.  they were bright but not glaring. as the object advanced toward my home i looked up as it began to pass over the trees in my front yard.  i estimate the diameter of the circle to be at least 100 ft. wide.  i could not see any outline beyond the circle of lights, but by the way they moved together and also rotated slowly around a common center i had the distinct impression that they were attached to something much bigger that was not visible in the darkness. it made no sound as it passed over. \r\n\r\nthe individual lights were a kind of \"square oval\" shape and appeared to also have a low domed profile.  the object was moving from the north to the south in a line directly over my house. as i saw it pass directly over my roof at perhaps 100 to 500 ft altitude i was already thinking how i would get through the darkness to the south deck on my house. i knew i had a flashlight in my bedroom, so i attempted to grope my way through the profound darkness that now filled my house, find my flashlight, and try to observe the object as it continued on its due south flight path. however, i became disoriented in the darkness and ended up fumbling in my office closet thinking that i was in the hallway.  by the time i found my way to the bedroom and found my flashlight and came out on the deck, the object was no where in sight.  so i do no know which direction it departed in.  i did notice that the night was \"unusual\" in various ways beside the power and lights being out.  there was a vague reddish hue in the night sky, no stars or moon, a slight balmy breeze, but the air was almost visible as if it were a liquid.  i was of course excited, but i didn't feel any fear or dread.  i did feel exhilarated....It was quite an experience.  power returned about two hours later.","distance":"101-500

of what i discovered is why these flying saucers showed up. what i found is very small sony camcorders have a strong zoom as i was filming part of a fence i must have brushed up against them they flew out of the wood in a orb shape when they were about 2 feet away they changed into small flying saucers mind you i thought they were bugs but when i looked at the pics i saw that they weren't. i have had 5 encounters with them 3 yes i saw them hovering above my head. i know that they are observing my every move because of what i have found they have compromised over 300,000 pics 100s of hours of video. i won't go into detail about what i have found because every time i i tell someone what it is there minds close up and they look away.\r\n other people have seen them and some of them have been put away.The difference is i have proof beyond a reasonable doubt please i need help on my fathers and brothers graves what i have found might be one of the greatest discoveries ever made i have left a couple of phone numbers on facebook of people who can verify my story i have used facebook as somewhat of a journal the whole story is there with hundreds of pics please take the time to look at what i have my phone number is (removed phone number place in contact information cak)  this is the third time that i have tried to submit this form hopefully they will let me post some pics going this way now i know that this is pretty far out there all the pics are real if you look close at the saucers not the white ones(the blue in the pics deteriorates the pics meaning compromised). i just figured out that they are not flying saucers they are helmets with these strange looking guys heads in them you can see them in the pics where you can see a figure with the helmets on there heads have i lost you yet.  now the pic with the alien lady you have to look close she's watching these monsters destroying the wood trying to get at what i discovered there are two pics of the monsters them selves look close you will see a little person he has a duckbill sort of face being hauled away and a female trying to hold him back. please i hope i haven't chased you away for 2 years now i have seen things right out of a scifi movie. i know way way to much why i am still here i don't know. you must at least talk to me as you can see writer i am not i will not let you down so much more to

below each other. then four combined to three and moved up about two or three hundred feet then back down to about one hundred feet above the ground. one of the lights moved to the right a few feet and became a bit brighter .The dogs then got very quite, the lights started moving up  slowly then in a fraction of a second they picked up speed and were been  gone. at that point we all realized we had been outside several min. and were cold and had been standing there with our mouths open but not saying anything. we did not talk about this after that day .Never saw it again or anything like it. my mother and older brother are gone now so i think i should say something to someone befor i am gone as well. i remember that night from time to time very clearly. that area we lived in was very

on 02/07/15. \r\n on the previous night of 2/6, i was on the return trip from walking my dog when an intensely bright orange light caught my attention from behind the nearby treeline north of my position. i noted that the light did not have strobes or navigation lights of green/red. just bright orange like a mercury-vapor streetlight with slight red tones at times.\r\n despite my dog tugging to keep going,i stopped and grabbed the cellphone from my back pocket to snap photos. shoot first, delete later if helicopter photo was my thinking. time was 8:14pm on phone when i got it out. i took a total of 6 photos while object was passing overhead since both sides of street had trees limiting viewing arc. only two 'worthy' pics came out which i uploaded here,unaltered, and a third 'enhanced' photo that i resized/adjusted to make it more like i viewed it versus how the phone saw it. ignore blue dots in photos. i think they're pixelated stars as that night was clear.\r\nobject moved quickly, silently in straight path from n to ssw. the old chinese sky lantern explanation here, except that it was moving quickly on a windless night (ground level) and the intensity of the light without flickering made me rule that out. only variance of light i would describe as 'shimmering' from bright to brighter. \r\ntying this to the oldsmar report is that sighting occurred directly south of both oldsmar, fl and 4.5 miles south of clearwater st pete airport runway 36r. i cannot estimate the objects altitude other than it appeared as high as the planes on approach to the airport when they pass over my house.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":63331,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.773056,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02142015-0012","longitude":-82.64,"occurred":1423282500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1423985701000,"summary":"","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/63331_submitter_file1__WP000701.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/63331_submitter_file2__WP000702.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/63331_submitter_file3__WP000701a.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8,"locationName":"Saint

inside.Got smart phone.Waited a couple mins it seemed for it to get in video range.Jet and ufo were gonna hit,collide yet passed one over the other about 1/4 mile away over land to the north west. blink blink ,in white specks, was the jet on my vid screen.Object in question was black or invisible on view screen.Aiming to anticipate it's route, i aimed at the building peak,the object \"passed\" it.My camera eye was new to me ,mostly, and is off center from my familiarity with camera phones.Mercury light is about the size of a medicine ball and is up about 25-27 feet on the steel buildings side.Peak is about 3 feet higher than merc light. peak is about 5 paces out from standing video location. ..Running west to east for example(the peak). craft was silent.About 1,000 feet off the ground.Speed about 30 mph.Never altered appearance yet traveled.Looked like icicles sticking out like quils (3-4 total).Blinked at it yet,no alteration.Focusing \"to it\" was painfully difficult and tough.In video i felt awkward i might be preparing to film a chopper or flare/ fire work etc... i stated \"naw, i don't have the resolution...However...It's a weird one...This is really not good...It won't come in !\" ( pan down to end video in frustration --- mercury light again in left corner....) roof appears bronzy in color...Beam from ship exits on an angle, and , at my vicinity - and is brownish tan as it traveled low slow and clear on video.I \"let it go\",when video was a \"fail\"  etc...And \"allowed it to travel off\" without further pursuit, going north east (rising sun side) in its straight line path....Soon after i called 911.2 sheriffs deputies, 2 cars...2 mins later...During report, i showed the officer a bright light leaving our planet.....I said \"do you see that! \" he said ,\"i see it .\"....I said \"do you got that !?\" he said,\"i got it .\" and we watched for about 5-7 seconds this venus sized object (as seen from earth with the unaided eye,like a star....) go away from us, clearly,at about 95,000 feet or whatever is high ,high in altitude,near space gravity...At an arms length ,traveling the distance of an open hand--- in six seconds about--- at about a degree , to due north on the sighting location,of 86 going to 87 ....Straight path,then \"bam\" ....Lights out,like somebody threw a bucket if cold water on it....Or it went into the belly of the mother ship....Or it hit a worm hole or something it just-- bam was out.Gone. we both said \"woah!\"....Officer said \" i never seen anything like that before !\"...Other officer stepped out ,\"what was that ?!\" i said, \"saw another ufo .\" now i reported to nat.Ufo rep.Ctr in sept time....He,pete,got back after some serious phone tag,lol,to tell me \"we don't investigate\"...I said \"do i try collage labs ?!\" he said ,\"yea !\"....That was jan-feb...Big ol waste a time right...Got a little \"traction\" with us air force (former) and thier friends with a super computer....They found in feb ....The beam is refracting, repeat refracting....Not that i said reflecting ...Ok....It is 5 (five)feet wide ,ok,in width as it exits the craft in question...Ok they said it is not a dowel or doweling it isn't even a post or wood or steel or a stadium light or street light etc....It is probably  plasma or a tractor beam etc ....Yet,it is 30(thirty) feet wide or in width at some point down away from

i was driving, my wife was front passenger, my daughter was rear middle seat passenger. we turned onto our block heading north. then with seconds, at about 1,500 before out house, i observed in the sky directly to the north of us, at about 45 degrees, a very bright amber light, with a tint of red in it. the light was not bothersome my eyes, and was very beautiful to look it. it was in the sky moving from west to east, at about 80 mph estimated. i noticed right away it was not a normal aircraft that i have ever scene. it had no blinking lights (standard aviation safety). it was close enough that i was able to know if safety lights where present. i pointed out the light to my wife, and we slowed down. i, my wife and daughter, all leaned forward trying to observe the object, all the while i was trying to watch the road at the same time. \r\n \r\n as the lighted object was then blocked by a tree, i speed up a little to get to our drive way quicker, at which time during some visual breaks in other trees we started to pass by, the lighted object maintained it's course and speed. we pulled in the drive way, park the car fast, and we all got out, and swiftly moved about 15 feet away from the drivers side to further observe the lighted object in a clear area. there was no noise heard by any of us. further away in the eastern sky, the lighted object stopped briefly and hovered, it was easy to see it was motionless. then after about 15 seconds, it started moving again, continuing it's course east. again, no blinking lights, and a very bright amber color with a tint of red blended. after a few minutes, after getting further away, to the point of it being visually the size of a pin head, it disappeared. \r\n\r\n my wife and i kept mentioning to each other how we never saw anything like it before, and we agreed it was not any known aircraft to ether of us. and it was not a meteor due to it's slow speed and not tale. \r\n\r\n now keep in mind, that through the day time hours, and sometimes through the night, aircraft do pass over, both small and large military and civilian aircraft. even with the known aircraft we often see through the days, we can always tell it is man made no matter how far up in the sky they are. all the man made aircraft we notice, 9 times out of 10 fly from south to north, or north to south, never west to east. and we can always here any sounds from a propeller or jet aircraft, no matter how high they fly because the sounds easily echo down to us. again the craft made no noise, and that was very unusual because is 55 degrees and sound carries loader and further in the cold. \r\n\r\nto give you a better understanding of what we observed, since we had no camera's available at the time, i did google \"amber light in the night sky\", and copied it to give you a close example of what it look like. it is attached. \r\n\r\nanyways, that's all there is to it. i let my wife know i was going to report it to mufon, and there ya go. \r\n\r\n~thanks\r\n[item moved/cms/nd]","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then
