sky at that time and place.I was just with my three dogs and my cat.I cannot  say nothing on that object.Of course it was flying but i'm not sure if it was stopped in the sky or if it had appeared in the photo just by that take and disappeared or not after it.I became surprised and confused on it.I thought i had to send the photos to the director of investigation - steve hudgeons jr,and so i did it.The photo with the object it the 3806 attached to this

maybe one would be police show.  it was very dark outside. my mom was out by the line taking care of the clothes that were hanging on the line. the line was near craig road which had woods & trees across it and on the other side of that was a golf course.\r\n\r\ni was in the mobile home with my sister and brother.  i looked out the door towards my mom and saw the round bright orb floating over the trees. it was not very high over the trees. it moved slowly from south to northerly direction. rt 86 towards the county home. rt 198.  it did not move fast but at a steady speed.  it was very bright. \r\n\r\nit scared the hell out of me. i followed it and was so scared i locked the trailer door. my mom was inside by then and told me that would not stop them from taking me if they wanted me.  it looked like videos that i see on line. round glowing orb.  i know this is nothing to go on but i do consider it as probe of some kind checking out the area.  it was not swamp gas or anything.  it was very cold outside.\r\n\r\ni know it is not a lot to go on.  later my mom forced me to take the trash out and i was scared as hell but since one did not tell my mom no i did it.\r\n\r\nmy

and the anxiety building up it felt like we were being invaded for sure. the lights came on even more brighter as it was landing and the object appeared right on camera and flickered and looks like it appeared to have used a time warp to jump place to place in a split second with excellent driving skills, there was 3 cameras at the school compound facing that general direction that were destroyed or sabotaged that night we went to look for footage that next morning from the night before and the brand new camera system they had put in mysteriously had been damaged somehow and i requested last known data from the images last recorded from a nearby city that's where the data goes they say. when i went to tell my friend who stayed a couple houses down and show him the video he said oh yeah awesome come get me if anything happens or if you see anything, i said ok and as i was walking out the door that same craft was just lifting off the school compound again really slow and quietly i ran back inside to get him and his son came out and witnessed an object the size or 2 or 3 houses big hovering away from site mentioned in a slow quiet flight path. he was running back inside to get his device but it was to late i got the only footage of this event witnessed by a few people of my reserve here. i am ready to blow the lid right off this conspiracy once and for all using this unseen by

first said is this a meteor or something entering the atmosphere. it looked like a comet with a double tail the most which was not possible. the core of object was very high so details were tough but was either square or blended into a star shape. once the object slowed down then sped up i realized it was something moving. i immediately said out loud that this is strange. it did not seem like a plane or helecopter at all the more i looked at it. it was not a meteor either because i se them all the time and they go quick. once the double trail caught my eye and the object slowed down i realized it was something else. i even opened the side window to ensure it wasnt a reflection on my windshield from the street lights. by the time i grabbed my cell phone and opened up the camera app the object was already speeding up then it was gone. i was mad i didnt even get a shot at it. also looked out the side window again and saw stars in the sky in the area with some clouds lower in the

night. i smoke so i always go outside my house late at night. these balls of white light change speed and direction many of the times when they pass over. you can tell they are high as or higher then passenger airplanes. i can tell this because i see many types of jets over my house on there way to seattle but always traveling from south to north. i told my roommates about this and they didn't believe me until i woke one of them up one night to show her and it totally freaked her out because the one i showed her changed direction and slowed down and then sped up and went higher and out of sight in a few seconds. one night about 6 months ago about 1-2 am i was out smoking and watching the sky. i saw one of the craft and this time i had a telescope ready so i could get a better look at it. by some miracle i got the telescope locked on to it and this was definitely a round, white ufo. suddenly the craft shot up at an angle and out of view. then about 20 seconds later i saw this orange laser beam shoot from out of space into the atmosphere at about a 45deg angle downward and it disappeared from view behind the house next to mine. you could tell the beam came through about 50-100 miles away (possibly next to mnt st helens toward eastern washington). i was in the army for 8 years so i have seen many different types of military aircraft and believe me these lights aren't anything we fly or anything that our government has admitted to yet. back in 2001 i also saw a \"giant\" (easily the size of 2 football fields across) black triangle fly over my apt building at about 1am (again i was out smoking). it had no lights on it and made almost no sound other than the sound of the wind passing over the hull and a slight hum of some type of power source. it had to be flying about 200ft high and about 50mph at the most. like i said i could hear the sound of the wind passing over the hull. i wish i had a video camera that you could show these lights at night because i see them all the time. i even downloaded the app for the international space station to see if it might be what i am seeing but the thing wasn't even close. these things also change direction and speed so

while i was there.  i didn't notice anything strange until i got home and noticed objects appearing in the video frame extremely quickly and disappearing quickly.\r\n\r\ni went through the entire footage that i had captured looking for these high speed anomalies and then slowed the video down to 1% of normal speed.  i was using a gopro hero 3+, so my footage was 1080p at 60 frames per second.  i was able to capture several frames of each object when slowed to 1% of normal.\r\n\r\nthe objects usually flew in a straight line, but sometimes veered off in different direction slightly.  they appeared white against the blue sky, but up close they were almost transparent.  however, i was able to capture a shadow on the pavement from one of them, so they are definitely solid and have some substance.\r\n\r\nthe closest approximation that i can make is to that of \"rods\", but these were not rod shaped. they were star shaped, or some type of central object with several protrusions coming out of it.\r\n\r\ni have the analyzed video as well as the raw video, which i would love to be examined by a videographer or optical specialist.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 501 Feet - 1

and my best friend hiked back to his truck to drive home. while sitting on the tailgate of his truck to eat a sandwich, we both saw a high flying jet with a blinking light going from a south to north direction.Then we saw another light coming on the same flight path at a high rate of speed that came from the same direction. there was just a solid bright light that the object omitted. the flying object slowed down to the same speed as the jet. we thought at the moment that it might be a military plane that was following the other plane. but then the rear flying aircraft did a 90 degree turn and when straight up and disappeared into the outer atmosphere on this clear night sky. \r\n over the years i have told this story to friends. some believed and some would ask if we had been drinking? the answer is no, we had not drank any alcohol.This was the late 70s and we knew of no aircraft that could turn on a 90 degree angle and go into outer space. the harrier jet could take off from an aircraft carrier or land but this thing did a 90 degree turn while going approximately 500 miles per hour, and accelerated straight up into the night sky.","distance":"Over One
