as she watched, a shape went across the sky, from west travelling east, at about 45 degrees. the shape was obvious only due to the silouette of the shape obscuring the stars behind it. as it crossed the sky, the > shape allowed the stars to shine within the hollow of the mid-structure- so she knew it wasn't a solid triangle shape. she said it was enormous and completely silent, with no reflective or metallic quality. it took about 5 seconds to cross the full path of sight and was gone.\r\n\r\nshe had called the local astronomy director at the observatory, but he did not return her

corazã²n latã­a rã¡pido por lo intenso del sueã±o)\r\nllovã­a levemente podã­a ver las pequeã±as goteras en la lampara de luz amarillenta del poste de alumbrado pã¹blico, respirã¨ profundamente y empecã¨ a mirar el cielo que estaba gris obscuro (me gusta mucho observar las estrellas hobbie que disfruto cuando salgo de paseo al campo) miraba extraã±ado el cielo pues no se veã­an nubes definidas era mas bien una capa uniforme a muy poca altura de un solo tono de grã­s obscuro. respirando ya menos agitado mientras continuaba mirando al cielo pensã¨ en recostarme de nuevo, pero me diã² curiosidad una pequeã±a luz que vã­,  pensã¨ que era muy casual poder ver una estrella con el cielo tan cubierto. me concentrã¨ en la luz y para mi sorpresa habã­a otra mas luego otra hasta que pude ver claramente dos largas filas muy cerca una de la otra, compuesta de pequeã±as luces blancas apenas perceptibles (no tengo un nã¹mero exacto de las luces, estas estaban a todo lo largo de la superficial que vi excepto en las ã¡reas de las puntas).\r\napenas fuã­ conciente de que lo que estaba sobre mi casa (barrio y ciudad) no era  normal, empecã¨ a limpiarme los ojos, lleguã¨ hasta pelliscarme, para asegurarme que no seguã­a soã±ando, ya identificadas las luces (podã­a ver el principio de ellas, pues continuaban por encima de mi casa y no podã­a verlas completas por el techo). me concentrã¨ aã¹n mã¡s siguiendo el sentido que las luces llevaban y pude ver un contorno, mas adelante de donde terminaban se destacaba unas lã­neas simples con un tono de gris ligeramente mã¡s obscuro que el resto del cielo. seguã­  las lã­neas y  pude ver claramente la punta del objeto que flotaba diagonalmente sober mi casa. \r\ndesde mi ventana podã­a ver la punta  del objeto con un ã¡ngulo cercano a 60 grados, estimã¨ que el objeto flotaba a sã²lo 1000 metros de altura por lo que esa primera parted del objeto que vã­ tenã­a una longitud considerable. de immediate apaguã¨ la luz de la habitaciã²n abrã­  la cortina total y empecã¨ a mira's a travã¨s del vidrio y no se veã­a bien, habian reflejos y nada de contrasted, luego tratã¨ de escuchar poniendo mi oreja entre los vidrios de la celosia y no logrã¨ nada, completo silencio. volvã­ a concentrarme en las filas de luces, estaban distanciadas simã¨tricamente, pude percibir luego que la superficial no era plana, era cã²ncaba y las luces estaban en el medio, tambiã¨n que no era lisa, se asemejaba a la textura de unas ollas para cosinar (busquã¨ online y encontrã¨ unas con la textura muy similar pero de otro color. pasaron 4 minutos donde pude ver claramente esa porciã²n del objeto pero sin poder escuchar algã¹n sonido. lego el objeto empezã² a moverse lent aments, con direcciã²n norte, el contorno de lineas muy simples (un rectã¡ngulo largo con formas muy simples al principio y final del ã rea que vi claramente.) empecã¨ a agitarme me parã¨ en la cama sin dear de mirar el objector por la celosia abierta, hasty que pude ver el contorno de la parte final.\r\nel objeto se desplazã² en lã­nea recta lentamente (diagonal a mi ventana) yo parado en mi cams mirando por la ventana no creã­a lo que estaba pasando, 30 segundos mas tarde el objecto se encontraba lejos, ya no podia ver la superficial con las luces, encambio pude ver la totalidad de la estructura. el objeto era 15 veces mas alto que ancho y 20 veces mad largo que ancho, de ancho estimo 300 metros.\r\nel objeto desapareciã² entre bruma blanca que rodeaba las montaã±as.\r\nno me volvã­ a dormir (no querã­a despertar creyendo que habã­a sido un

walked home. as i walked westerly, a soft blue light suddenly covered everything around me. i could see my long shadow ahead of me, so i instinctively turned around to see where the source of the light was coming from. there was what seemed like a submarine shaped object in the sky over the beach or ocean, at about 32 degrees above the horizon, just sitting there hovering in one place. as i stared at it i noticed it wasn't like a submarine, but a disk, and i was seeing it in an elliptical shape as the side view which made it seem almost cigar shaped. it had a low conning tower type raised thing on top with circular windows or light in equal distances apart, going all around the top, or at least i assume they continued around it. the blue light bathed me and something held me there, unable to move. it felt as if a short time had passed but it made me feel as if i'd been there a long time because it left me very tired. i'm guessing only a minute or so, yet it always made me wonder because of the fatigue. my gaze was glued to it as it just stayed in that one spot, and then it seemed to just move ever so slightly and was gone in a blink of an eye. i was standing there in the middle of the dirt road flabbergasted, and heard the ladies voice in an excited \"oh my!\", turned, and we both exclaimed at the same time, \"did you see that?!! it was a ufo!!!\" my mouth and her mouth were wide open, our eyes, too. i ran home and woke up my family, got my telescope and tripod out, laid on a chaise lawn chair and gazed skyward for another hour, but never saw it again. i've seen two more ufo's in my lifetime, but both were much different than the first one. but because there was a witness, i knew it couldn't possibly be my imagination. had a witness for the second one, too. the third was in broad daylight as i was going to work, so many people had to have seen it, it was huge.I don't want to write a book here so i'll leave you with that much. i just wanted to at least mention my first sighting since it made the biggest impact on my life. i'm 64 now and disabled. i had a long career at kennedy space center. space became my life. i'd love to meet

evening is the same nothing has change until earlier this morning around midnight.  my family is home and tv volume is going thru the night. then, suddenly i was not in my room.\r\nsince, last friday

strength to be better. later that evening i went to bed earlier. watching tv until about 10:00 pm. fell asleep watching the news on keyetv. my tv was set on timer so it would go of by itself.\r\nas my sleep went on i found myself next to a river with is a big water fall. i remember someone walking next to me talking. also, a child was walking with me as we wanted to run around. the waterfall and walkway was all silver. i am trying to run to the edge of the water wanting to catch fish. they seem bigger than me. i remember building lights as home on the edge of the mountain next to the river. even thought i was seeing a world from a different place i was so at peace. this person seem to know i needed help badly. we walked as we have been walking all day for hours and it was beautiful too see a world different from ours. \r\nthen i walked into a room that look like an operation room as the whole room was all silver. this person was helping me to the table asking me to lay on my stomach. first ask me to turn up on my left side next to a rail. then i was ask to put my arm up over my head. something was holding my hands up over my head. i saw 3 people like nurses coming in and a person like a doctor by my head. one next to my head, 1 by my left side and right side, then one by my lower back all laying there hand on me. these 4 people all wearing a whitish gray color. the person like a doctor was in a blackest to blue color outfit and being a lady with long hair. i ask them to show me the spot they were going to work on. exactly the spot you could not touch my back. then all i saw was 4 silver proves coming down to my back. \r\nthen i remember screaming from the severe pain. then someone touch my back it pop and the pain stop. i woke up in my room on my stomach with my hands on the railing holding on. as i woke up i could feel no more pain in my lower back, legs and hips. my son walked into my room then as i told him what happened. i had him look at my back and he saw no marks on my lower back. i told my son i could feel my legs with no more severe pain.\r\ni still have pressure in my lower back but, now a person can touch my lower back. it is like there is no nerve pressure pain. even though i cannot tell you if this is true or not, they do not come during the day. what happened to me is it real or a dream and why did my family not hear anything they were home. the day before this visit you could not touch my lower back for 3 years and now after this you can.\r\n\r\nseeing my son\r\n

going to happened that i could tell. during the night i lay back watching tv for a few minutes. the tv was to shut off by a timer set for 60 minutes.\r\n\r\nduring the night i found myself standing in a room of all silver with 3 doors ways. everything was silver even where i was standing. suddenly, i saw a person with black hair that looks like me and my son whom has black hair. it had to be my youngest son i have not seen in years since he is not of this world. i remember another person in front of me as he was next to a different doorway.\r\n\r\nsudden, i fell down and this young man walked over and caught me telling this other person i was injury. i remember my son picking me up and carrying me back to a room. he would not let anyone near me. then i woke up wednesday morning tell my son’s here they had a brother.\r\none call me crazy and the other son was glad he had a younger brother. i told both my boys he is not from this earth. he could not live here on

kitchen to try to cook some soup for everyone that was sick. as i was washing a pot out i look out the small kitchen window for what reason i don’t know. as, i was looking out the window i call my husband to come to the kitchen window to see this huge yellow light down the road. before he could get up the light was so big that it disappear in less than a bling of an eye. there was no other lights that look like that then vanish.\r\ni saw the traffic on fm 812 moving back and forth. there was nothing moving at all no other lights on it. it was bigger than the spot light on star flight.

ordinary. both objects moved directly straight up. it seemed as if one is chasing the other. the chaser on bottom gave off a trail like a normal jet or airliner. the chased on top did not give off any trail. but they are both moving extremely fast and seem the be keeping the same distance. also moving straight up. they are obviously moving the same extreme speed. while one is leaving its trail and the other just seems to be floating fast straight up. the chased top object appeared to be extemely shiny, just like it was solid chrome. the object overall was round but had solid sharp edges. both objects where rather large. as the objects acsended into the sky two streaks of firery, electric looking light streaked through the sky sideways. this happened twice and you can see in the video. i felt totally confused at what i was seeing and almost had to \"snap back\" into the life that was around me. i then lost sight of the objects as they continued there path straight upward. i was

that's strange the tunnel lights are off then i realized i was sitting on the side of the freeway in my car and things started getting bright again. my radio was static and it was clearing, that's when i realized i was sitting at the tunnel entrance and there was this very deep hum in my head. my car was running but missing. i was trying to figure out what the hell  is going on. so before i put my car in gear i thought what time is it i was married with a wife and young daughter at home. that's when i realized i couldn't move my arms i was tingly all over but my movements were coming back' this is when i panic set in. i finally got it together and took off i drove through the tunnel and just couldn't hold it together and had to pull over, i was freaking out and couldn't figure why. so i got out of my car to get some air and a highway patrol officer pulled up and asked what was wrong and said i looked white as a ghost his light on me i was very weak he helped me sit down and thought i was drinking and i wasn't but then he said the thing i'll never forget [its 1 am just wondering what your doing stopped on the side of the road] i looked at my watch and it read 11:01. i of course never said anything to him so buy the time he got back with my license i had closed my door and he let me go.  to this day i never told anyone but it has haunted me for over 40 years. i do watch stuff and it seems everyone sees lights and craft and all kinds of stuff.  i saw nothing. but something took 2 hours of my life that has caused great concern over the past 40 years. i had no history if blackouts and to this day have never had one. i have done some things that i'm not proud of maybe we all have but its so hard to explain. something happened to me that night and i really would like to know if anyone else has had my experience. i could tell you more about dreams i think they are dreams i at this time am so nervous this is as i said the first time talking about it. i will tell you this i can tell you where i think i was i have this vision of something that seems crazy but if you would like to hear it email me and i guess i would be willing to talk more  sorry for taking up so much time but after all this time i had to finally tell someone.  thank you very much. p.S. my wife was asleep but i stayed up all night just looking out the window at the dark in a daze then just

amplifier so i could carry it and play my electric guitar while riding my mountain bike.L had just finished talking with an old highschool friend in front of his familes home near chabot colledge on depot rd in hayward ca is was around 11:00 at night when i was ready to leave my friend and head to my home near mount eden high school another friend of mine sam was at the friends house that i was leaving fron and he asked me if i was riding home and if he could join me i said yes so we both rode south towards my home on florida st we turned left onto sleepyhollow ave then right onto portsmouth st portsmouth turns into arf ave when you pass lorn eden elementary school located on the left hand side of the street.We were getting near lorn eden elemetary school when sam said what the heck is that i looked in the direction he was looking and saw what looked like a small orange pinkish star hovering directly above the school i told sam i think i can get its attention content://media/external/file/2644i turned on my battery powered guitar amp turned up the volume on my electric guitar to almost full volume and started playing a guitar solo as we rode passed the school sure enough the ufo started to travel east in our same direction at our same speed as i kept playing the guitar i. had been riding bicycles while playing acoustic guitar for a while so i was good at riding while playing guitar at the time of this sighting. the ufo continued to fallow us east down arf ave flying about twenty feet above the rooftops of the condo's when we reached hesperian blvd i rode up to the stop light directly across the street from mrs rotten robbies gas station on the corner of pannama st the next street that arf turns into. i was still playing the guitar while i was pushing the button on the street sign to cross. the street when the ufo came down from above the last rooftop and hovered directly above me about fifteen feet in the air i could see it clearly and i saw thousands of finger lenth pink sparks all sparking simultaniously i was so stuck on this viewing that the sign to cross the street had already changed from cross back to wait again i was still playing the guitar whole time from the school untill right after i noticed the crosswalk signal changed from walk to don't. walk.Then as i was looking up at it i stopped playing the guitar and as soon as i stopped the sparks started to shut off one at a time until i saw the last spark stop and i was looking up where it was and saw nothing just blackness i turned to sam and said did you see that ? and he said yes i did and i said to him that was a ufo and said it could have been one of those chinese floating paper baloons with a candle in it and i said those things dont fallow you down the street and they don't fly down to where your at and hover above you with sparks and he said maybe it was a drone and i said i'm so tired of everyone saying that ufos\" are drones i told him you can be in denial all you want but i know for a fact that what we just saw was a genuine. ufo it was gone as far as i could tell so we continued on our way riding to the house on florida st i wasn't playing guitar i was just riding and looking up but not seeing anything so i just stopped looking we made a left turn onto calaroga ave heading south as we were turning left onto florida st he said what not again,i looked southeast and hovering directly above the elementary schoolformaly known aseureka there was the star looking ufo again sam said we're almost to the house lets just go home and i said hell no its not everyday that i get to see a ufo that close up and i started riding towarrds it he sighed and reluctantly fallowed me i turned my amp back on turned up my guitar and started lead soloing again and once again it started fallowing us we made a left onto catalpa st and it came out over the roofs of the houses i turned my amp up full blast and didn't realize untill cars were driving around me on both sides that i was jamming in the middle of the street with a ufo hovering only twenty feet above me it was such a rush i was captivated then i guess the ufo thought i was putting myself in danger so it flew away  ","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

international airport on december 26th, 2014 around 9:00 am or so (i'm unsure of exact departure time off the top of my head.) what felt like maybe 5 or 10 minutes after take off our plane had just broken through cloud cover and being that my phone was on \"air plane mode\" i figured it would be cool to take some pictures of the clouds because i don't get to fly a lot. my seat was somewhat positioned between 2 windows so to make sure i got at least 1 good shot, i took 4 pictures in total (just to be clear, the 5th photo is a zoomed in \"screen shot\" of the 4th photo object. the first picture was taken out of the window that was closer to the passenger in front of me (object in top left corner), the 2nd photo was taken out of the window that was closer to the passenger behind me (no object), and the last 2 photos were from the same window as the 1st (object again in almost the same top left location). \r\n\r\nafter taking the photos i had looked up and saw that no one else had any electronic devices out so i thought maybe i should put it away. because of this i didn't look at the photo's i had taken until we landed otherwise i would for sure have taken more and probably even a video..So sorry about that. : / once i had time to look them over i was pretty excited to see if they turned out well, but didn't expect them to be this interesting. i have never really thought about ufo's or things like this before but when i first saw these pictures i really had no doubt in my mind that this was something not normally seen by many...I showed my uncle and he thought it was a plane and gave it no more than a 2 second glance...I suppose it could be military or something but i don't know what plane goes that high up considering my plane was more than likely already half way to cruising altitude (maybe between 10 and 20 thousand feet) at time of taking these...Also, when zoomed in on the photos (especially the 4th one) i can't see any resemblance of a plane at all. no wings or tail or anything...I see a grey-ish triangle or pyramid shaped object with significantly strict uniformed edges and absolutely no sign of any trail coming from it like a plane at that altitude might have. all in all, i decided to not just keep it on my phone with out telling anyone so here i am a month and a half later giving it to people who might know more. \r\n\r\nalso, just in case anyone is wondering, i emailed myself the photos from my \"gallery\" on my iphone and saved then to my computer to upload to this site...Other than that, nothing has been tampered with, edited, cropped, cut, or anything else like that...As i stated earlier, the 5th picture here is simply just a zoomed in and \"screen shot\" version of the object in the 4th photo. thanks and have a good day!","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

blue light on one tip a green light and on the other tip was    white light. part of me remembers a red light somewhere anyway,my room was at one end of the house and when i first saw it, it it was at the far side of the house,i remember touching my eyes to make sure i was awake it was maybe20,25feet off the ground maybe10 feet away from the side of the house slowly flying parallel to the second floor of the house. there was no sound, at first i was amazed then i thought if i can see it they can see me then i had an overwhelming feeling of dread and fear.I ran to the closet\r\nand hid. i remember seeing the bright light under the door and then i'm in my mom's room crying and she's telling me to go back to sleep my dad walked me back to my room and my friend who was sleeping over said she saw something in the neighbors drive way.Next thing i know i'm coming home from school the next day then when my dad got home he tol qd my mom that she should have believed me cause in the paper was an article that said the town about30minutes away saw the same thing i saw. after that she always looked at the sky she wanted to see them too. iwas13when that happened i'm 51now i can't talk about it without crying even after all these years i don't know what happened to make me cry when i think about it still . i do have a lot of dreams about ships in the sky and i see the the tall shining blonde beautiful people. but i had to tell someone about my sighting even though it was a long time ago.I'm still a little scared that the \"men in black\"will come to the door.  if you think

camper trailer that was in a subdivision approx. 5 miles north of town . while wandering around some junk, sipping on a beer(which i soon spilled all over myself in the commotion) letting the new camper owner dig out the flat in the frozen ground, i noticed a bright surging light in a spot where there is no beacons or such in the sky. the light was staying in the same place and appeared to be dimming a bit. it looked like a heavy aircraft with all its lights and headed right toward us. there is an airport on that side of town. by this time i am freaking out telling my buddy to look. well, it just so happened, that the campers' owner had a nice 30x spotting scope with a tripod which he quickly set up and got the light focused in. a quick look at the time, 6:00pm sharp. so, as its killing me to look thru the scope, i encouraged him to set the scope well and get a good look. seeing that i did not know the particulars of it. never taking my eyes off of the light in sky, it was finally my turn to look. once my eye adjusted and i quit wiggling, the lights, were awesome to say the least. quick side note, a few seconds into viewing an orb flew behind the lights. it moved west to east leaving a small trail which disappeared quickly. the orb only appeared for less than a second. its fair to say the orb was moving at a high rate of speed. and no other orbs were seen that evening. the lights located in the middle of the craft were mainly white in the middle and had a rainbow of colors on the top and bottom of the light assembly. there were 2 lights which appeared an inch or so apart in the scope. these lights were arranged in a vertical fashion. however, while viewing the lights with the naked eye, there only appeared to be one light. the lower light was only a quarter of the brightness of the upper light. the craft had structure!! while the lights were surging and appeared to be at there brightest, you could actually see dark structure between the lights. the lower light appeared dimmer, but i think its because there was structure in the way. but, that's it, no definable edges or shapes, almost seemed like a blob with some crazy lights. the weather at the time was approx. 40 degrees f, wind gusts to 15mph i would say and the sky conditions were as follows, typical fading bright blue sky but there was this system of dark clouds moving in from the east moving west. there was also a full moon coming up and really illuminated the back side of the clouds moving in. to my best guess i would say the craft to have been 15-20 miles away. by this time its getting dark enough to get the camper down the road do to the lights half ass working and questionable tires. this is the cool part! i got the camper pulled out of the spot it was in and then into a more level spot and turned the truck off. we walked back down to pick up tools and such,as we watched for the light as much as possible. we got everything picked up and, as i was walking back up to my truck looking back as much as possible. the camper owner is fumbling around looking for his keys so i am walking kinda slow waiting to see if he finds them, when, all of the sudden, just as i happened to be looking at the craft, a bright green light appeared above the craft like a door opening, and then light appeared. the light could have even been projected. just as fast as the light appeared, it disappeared. for only about 3 seconds. i kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing did. the rainbow lights just kept doing there surging thing. so, i watched the light on the way back to town and the only thing that changed was that  the clouds were moving ever closer to covering the light. well, by the time i got home, the clouds had covered all of the light. when i first discovered the light, i called my girlfriend and told her to go outside and look. she also found the light in the sky. she watched it for a little bit and claims the light moved slowly up and down. i could not see that movement where i was at. since i have seen the light i have been asking everyone i know and two other people besides us three seen the light. my credentials for giving an accurate testimony is that i received my a&p certificate in 1993. i ate and breathed aviation for 15 yrs of my life as a mechanic and flight mechanic and feel i have a pretty good handle on things that fly in the sky. i'm not quite sure what kind of craft it was but i defiantly seen my first ufo!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n[item moved/cms/nd]\r\ncodywyoming\r\n","distance":"Over One
