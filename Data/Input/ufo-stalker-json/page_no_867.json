fireworks show. we were talking and walking out onto the street when we noticed the orb coming towards us. we only live across the street from the golf course so our walk home was going to be short. the orb was coming across the sky towards us when we noticed it. i took out my flip and videotaped it as it came almost over us and just past us. the orb was a very bright red/orange color that looked like it was on fire yet it shimmered and rippled as water does. there was no sound from the object as it went over either. as i was taping there was a man and his children standing not 5 ft from me yet they and no one else around us(my husband and i)would look up! so at the end of the taping you hear me on the phone to my sister and her granddaughter who are already across the street in front of the house. my sister was just across the street from where we were so she and bella were watching the orb too. i was sooo excited to have seen it again but just when i thought it was gone there was another sighting just a half an hour later...But there were four more! i was in shock because i never thought we would see the orbs again. in total there was four separate sightings. the first was in march and we were maybe 50 ft from three orbs sitting in the sky forming an isosceles triangle above some houses. the second was this time that i just wrote about on the 4th of july. the third happened that same night on the 4th of july and the fourth sighting was on new years eve which there were three orbs.  i am excited yet angry at the same time. i have had many experiences before but never like this. it is all i can think about and i am very conflicted about it.","distance":"101-500

River","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My gal and i were awakened by an intermittent but rythmic, very audible buzz which pulsed from very slow sequentially to a steady buzz.  \r\n\r\neach sequential buzz would produce a different color of light until the buzz was steady at which point the light was white.  then the steady buzz would begin a sequential slowing which produced the colors of the rainbow with each slowing buzz. then the buzz sequence would start over from the slowest and darkest color with the time between pulses diminishing until a steady buzz was heard and the light was a steady white.\r\n\r\nthe light was coming in from the small bedroom window, illuminating the wall just above the dresser.  indicating the object was either hovering a few feet above the ground or maybe landed.\r\n\r\noddly, the light did not seem to reflect off of the wall surface as the room remained dark. the small window, about 2' square caused the light to assume this shape on the wall.  i remember the light pattern moving ever so slightly, just an inch or so. i believe it moved only laterally but maybe a n inch or so vertically as well.  i believe there was slight movement.\r\n\r\ni went to the window but was unable to see the shape of the object clearly or at all due to the heavy fog.  however the pulsing and changing light was very distinct.  \r\n\r\nthis event scared the hell out of me. i yelled at my gal to get out of bed to see the ufo as i needed a witness, for my sake if for no other reason, but she pulled the covers over her head and began screaming while kicking her heels on the bed. this was not helpful so i yanked the covers off of her and dragged her to the window.  more screaming and back to bed with covers over her head. but she did see the lights and admitted as much several years later to friends.  after much coaxing from me i might add. \r\n\r\nat this time the light pattern began moving on the wall and within seconds the object had lifted fairly quickly skyward and headed off in a nw direction, low over the trees.\r\n\r\nthe next morning at work, i asked my fellow loggers if there had been a ufo sighted over the town , powell river, and there was indeed some quiet talk at the coffee shop of strange low moving lights which were seen.\r\n\r\nyears later i began to wonder if my gal and i had been abducted in our sleep as i seemed to be only aware of this object shortly before it departed.  i didn't seem to have any marks on my body other than the usual damage from logging.  however,  sore spots did appear on my temple areas, left and right some years later.  they would become sore and occasionally clear fluid would leak out.\r\n\r\ni had these removed with dry ice three years ago. i always thought these were strange but don't know if they could be connected to that encounter.\r\n\r\nsince the encounter i awake at 3 am, give or take 10 minutes and have great difficulty falling asleep until 5 am when for some reason i suddenly feel that all is well and i can risk the vulnerability of being asleep.\r\n\r\ni have seen 8 ufo flying in a formation of 2 abreast and trailing, in 1957 as a young man. they were round and shiny, very high and very fast as they jinked across the limitless blue sky.\r\n\r\na week ago at 3 am i noticed what i thought to be venus in the night sky.  after a few minutes i returned from the bathroom and noticed the light had moved substantially and was approaching slowly.  slowly as in i believe too slowly to be a large aircraft. but not really very slowly.I am a pilot.\r\n\r\ni followed the object from the kitchen window and noticed there was no sound and the steady white lights on the under side were all wrong to be an airliner.  there was a blinking red light on the belly, which is appropriate for an airliner.  \r\n\r\nthe faintly illuminated underside showed the boomerang shape.  i really don't know what to think of this sighting but i believe it was too slow, too low, about 1000' or so, no engine noise and odd lights to be an airliner. end of story.","distance":"21-100

Rouge","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Just before noon on february 9, 2015, i was on my patio photographing jet aircraft.  i was photographing a boeing 737 when i noticed another object in the camera view finder.  i snapped a couple of quick photos, then centered the object in the view finder.  when i tried to snap the next photo, the auto focus couldn't focus on the object.  after a couple of unsuccessful attempts, i switched the lens to manual focus, panned down to a nearby treetop, focused on that, and then turned the focus ring a little more for the extra distance needed.  i looked back up into the sky, and could still see the object.  it was bright white, approximately spherical, and seemed to float in the air currents.  it was quite high (3 miles up, maybe more).  i suspected that it was some type of helium balloon.  after watching it for maybe 6 to 7 seconds, i then tried to get it in the view finder again, but was unsuccessful.  i could still see it, so i switched the lens back to auto-focus, and again focused on the nearby treetop.  when i looked back up into the sky, i could not spot the object again.  the whole siting lasted about 20 to 25 seconds.  i was rather frustrated that i couldn't get a better focused photo.  the object did not move in a straight line, but rather drifted a little left to right, while moving away and higher at the same time.  it was a lot slower than the plane.  the plane moved past the object by the time i snappped the second photo, while the object moved up.\r\n     i use the flight radar 24 phone app for my plane spotting.  the aircraft was american airlines flight aa1698, san juan to dallas, boeing 737-823, call sign n858nn, altitude 37,000 feet (data from the phone app).  it was roughly 5 miles (ground distance) from my location (per the map in the phone app), and approximately due north when i photographed it.  it was about 50 degrees off the horizon.  a weak cold front passed through baton rouge the night before, and it was a \"no-contrail day\", meaning that most jet aircraft do not leave contrails.  they are more difficult to spot and get in the view finder on these days.  \r\n     my camera is a canon t3i rebel digital slr.  the lens was a canon telephoto zoom 75-300 mm, set to 300 mm.  it is an inexpensive \"kit lens\".  at 300 mm the field of view is 6 degrees and 50 minutes, according to the instruction sheet for the lens. the camera was mounted on a cheap tripod.  \r\n   i am attaching the two photos, each with a cropped version.  i am fairly certain this was some type of balloon, but probably not a child's balloon or party balloon.  there seems to be some type of tether at the bottom of the object, and a black spot on the left side in the second photo.","distance":"Over One
