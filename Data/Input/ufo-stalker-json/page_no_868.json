battery (having battery charge problems).\r\nas i was walking to car i saw a small orb that was slightly larger than venus but looked more like an orb of light rather than a typical \"star\".  was slightly below where all the stars were in the night sky, including the actual venus(or one of the planets). i stopped at my car and i was facing the door. i noticed the light was moving at a steady pace, not fast but similar to airplane speed. the object was parallel to my front hood and moving at an angle to the right, towards the back of my car. it was high up, around the level of helicopters or small planes.\r\nas i watched it move i started out facing my car door with my head turned a bit to the left. object moved left to right. in about 10 seconds i had turned 90 degrees and my left shoulder was now next to the car door in order to keep the object in front of me.\r\n\r\nat this point it stopped and hovered for about 1 second and then began moving directly towards me so that it would fly directly overhead. so it made an almost 90 degree turn.\r\n\r\nit's movement was fairly smooth and there was no sound whatsoever.\r\nit's very quiet in town at 2am, no cars, no noise. it was a clear night with a bright moon and freezing cold, no real wind and about 8 degrees. planes and helicopters do often fly in my line of sight and no matter what their height is i can always hear them and quickly identify them. at night i usually check out the sky as i'm into cosmology.\r\n\r\nas it was moving towards a direct fly-over i couldn't help but to get creeped out as everyone was asleep, lights out and it was dead quiet. i did not expect it to suddenly veer off it's course and come right at me.\r\nso i turned around and quickly walked inside.\r\ni tried to see it out my window but could not locate it that way and when i went outside a few minutes later with binoculars it was gone.\r\n\r\neven before it changed direction it was very odd, a source of light that was very baffling. no blinking. it was immediately very out of place in the sky. in the summer i watch the sky on clear days just for stargazing so i am familiar with what's usually there.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

my boyfriend and some friends, we were just hanging out and throwing sticks for the dogs, and although it was late it was light out because we were in an elevated mountain area and the stars were bright. at one point i walked over to the side of the property overlooking the wooded valley area, to look at the view of the beautiful mountains in the north. what made me notice the lights was simply the fact that they were there, first one pretty far away although it was hard to tell in the dark. it was bright blue, like the blue of an led light but dancing around so quickly and spritely that it could never have been human. it looked like it was running around on the air around 100 feet from me, so i couldn't have caught up to it in the wooded area. i had no idea what it was, my mind couldn't think of anything that made sense. then there was another one, but it could have been the same one,i don't know. i never saw both at once but it felt like it was a different one. they both moved the same but were about 50 feet apart, but both in the wooded area. they hopped and danced around as if someone was swinging a light around but very fast and at all different heights, sometimes faster and sometimes not. i strongly felt like they were something i wish other people saw, and i wanted an explanation for these strange lights. but i couldn't think of anything. i lost sight of the objects because i think i was calling to my friends to come see them and i just lost my attention for a minute, or something else happened that distracted me, i don't remember. maybe one of the dogs ran into that wooded area and scared them off.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

at the stars. at precisely 18:05 he pointed to a moving star. i first thought it was a plane. but then i saw a very faint blue object (same size as a moving satellite) in front of it. both objects did not make any noises what so ever. the white object was the same size as the north star. both objects kept the exact same distance between them as they crossed the sky from west to east. they appeared to be higher than commercial jet flights, but the white light was too large for a satellite/space station type object. both moved slower than a commercial jet, at about the speed of a slow moving cessna. it was strange seeing the blue satellite like object in an exactly straight line in front of the white object. the distance between the two appeared to be between 4 and 5 cm (when looking at a satellite), meaning a fairly good distance at that height i suppose. then 10 minutes later (18:15) a helicopter flew in the exact same trajectory and it seemed to be at a higher altitude than i normally see helicopters. it also sounded like a newer type model (less noise making than traditional military black helicopters). what i found strange is that after it was quite past us to the east, it all of a sudden started having a strange red flashing light pattern: long flash, short flash. it continued with that light flashing pattern until i lost view of it. then at 18:25, we saw another helicopter, this one was somewhat lower in altitude and sounded like the typical military type helicopter, again, flying in the same trajectory. i have seen many times satellites fly in the night sky, including the space station, as well as commercial planes, but this was quite different. no noise. no flashing lights. what are the chances of seeing a small blue star followed by a large white start, both in a perfect straight line, both keeping the exact same distance between them, yet flying slower than commercial airplanes (and much slower than satellites do). and 2 helicopters? i figure it's the military that sent them to persuade people that they saw helicopters, not moving ufos.","distance":"Over One

done with a tae kwon do class. we live in a wooded neighborhood a few miles away from the town.\r\n\r\ngoing to our house, there are a lot of farms. at this time of year, most of the farmers had harvested their crops. in this case, it was corn. driving on these side roads, the woman i am in the car with and i spot a glowing light hovering above the tree line. we debate if it's a helicopter or a plane. it looks very far away. we then lose sight of it and forget about it. a few seconds later(about 10?) i look out the passenger window.\r\n\r\ni see a u.F.O, plain and simple. there is no mistaking what i saw. as i could remember the details clearly in my head till this day, two years later.\r\n\r\ni stood glaring at the u.F.O, in amazement. this may have been for about 15 seconds, glaring at it. about 50 feet away, 20-30 feet off the ground was a silver-metallic disc-shape hovering-in-place object. it looked like the stereotypical u.F.O. you would see on movies or cartoons.\r\n\r\none thing different from the stereotypical flying disc is where people presume the glass was on cartoons or shows, it was purely metallic. same color as the rest of the u.F.O. however, i could tell it was rotating in circles. it was very bright, however not to bright for me to make it out. there were 6 light panels in all. 3 on each side. i think they were rectangular or pure square.\r\n\r\nthis sighting amazed me. it stayed on my mind ever since. i wanted to report it, so i found this site and am doing it now. alas, i have no physical evidence. only the witness of i and the driver. even worse is that she did not see it like i did. but, given the chance, i would gladly take a polygraph test and/or go under hypnosis.\r\n\r\ni thought the least i could do is make a quick sketch of it. it looks a bit different than it actually was, though. my sketch makes it look bigger on top, when in reality the bottom and the top of the saucer were almost equal. please excuse the lighting, the good picture wouldn't import.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

traveled to a holiday inn in navarre beach.  my mother had told me it was a newly opened hotel.  it had an indoor pool, arcade, gift shop, deli, and small movie theatre.  for its day it was considered to be a very nice place and my family went to this hotel three times. during our second visit in august of 1977 the film jaws ii was being filmed at navarre and i even got to see the mechanical jaws stored with other movie equipment and props in the eastern portion of the hotel parking lot. \r\n\r\nduring this spring break vacation around late march of 1977 there was a special showing of the film bugsy malone where only children were permitted to attend.  it was during the film that i started to feel a bit disoriented.  i heard some other children crying and i heard the sound of someone throwing up.  at one point in the film i got up from my chair to leave, but i was quickly escorted back to my chair by an usher in a black suit and black hat.  i saw one or maybe two more men in black suits at the back of the theatre. after the film was over i felt just fine and i never did complain to anyone about that experience.  \r\n\r\none evening on this vacation i awoke and sat up in my bed.  i looked across the room and could see a group of small figures in the dimly lit room.  my brother was asleep to my right and my parents were asleep in the bed to my left.  the feeling i felt was something i had felt before which i immediately recognized.  it was a feeling i only have felt when the greys were near.   i thought “its been a while.” and to a young boy about to turn 7 it had been over 2 years since his last encounter with the greys.  so it had felt like a long time.  but then i could not move and one of the figures moved towards me very fast and the last thing i recalled were its big black eyes very close to my face and a wand like object being pointed at me.  then there was blackness.  the next thing i recall was being in the sand dunes away from the hotel in a circle of children. i must have been one of the youngest because i was the shortest.  but my attention was more on the blue object directly over us that had a glowing blue light all about it.  the closest thing i’ve seen to this shade of blue would be that of the blue glow of cherenkov radiation that i’ve only seen from photos.  then there was blackness.  the next morning was a saturday, and i was watching cartoons.  it was not till i was watching tv that i then recalled that nights experience with the greys and of seeing the blue glowing sphere above me and the other children.  i then told one of the other children that were traveling with us on this trip about my experience that night and she did not believe me.  i also recall walking around the hotel later that day and then getting up the nerve to tell my older brother who also teased me.\r\n","distance":"21-100

the estuary and noticed 500 feet in front of me, hovering just above the water line, a large group of about 14 rectangular pulsating lights, brighter than strobes, going from left to right or anticlockwise in what's described as the \"marquee fashion\".  so as one light goes to the right the next one follows from the left. the object was if held at arms length was six inches.  and whatever this object was it was perfectly flat on the bottom and never disturbed the water even though it was inches above it.  it also didn't appear to curve at the edges.  i was trying to weigh up if it was circular. \r\n\r\nmy thoughts at this time, i actually said out loud \"oh look a flying saucer\".  i laughed and then i began to think what am i looking at?  was it a  helicopter?  there was no  noise and this was inches above the water.  there was no disturbance to the water whatsoever as the lights gave a huge reflection in the water just under the object.  was it a boat with fishermen using some sort of lighted fishing nets?  it was not a hot air balloon, it wasn't a light aircraft.  i thought of everything that it could've been.  so i decided i would drive to a position nearer to it.  i drove my bike to the headland (1 minute drive away).  switched the bike off, no helmet on my head, i proceeded to view this object on my right and still hovering over the water below me.  i had now viewed the object for 15 minutes.  \r\n\r\nas i watched it there was no sound whatsoever, no air disturbance, just this bank of bright lights with its flashing pattern.  then it started to move towards me and began to rise very slowly up  in front of me.  this is when i was now about 25 foot away from it.  it rose up at a 30 degree angle.  just before it drew level with me i flashed my motorcycle lights directly at it three times.  i then thought do i really want to get involved in this?  so i stopped flashing my lights and watched this huge thing slowly meander up the valley.  \r\n\r\nit was a clear winters night, at teatime, around christmas time and there was no other vehicles present during this time!\r\n\r\ni didn't report the sighting due to my friend saying it was a plane from walney island or a hot air balloon from holker hall and wouldn't have another word said about it.  i took the hint and kept it to myself but never forgot the experience and i still don't know what it was to this day.\r\n\r\na few weeks later my mother showed me a local paper (westmorland gazette) reporting that two nuclear physicists from backbarrow, which is at the top of the same valley, on the same day, at 5.45 p.M. they witnessed the same thing as i had.  i managed to speak to them at the time on the telephone and he had said he had never seen lights so bright and in the same pattern as i had seen.  both of them said they thought they would never see anything like that again and we left it at that.\r\n\r\nmy own thoughts, i was never interested in the subject of ufos but after this i bought every book possible to see if there was any reports of a similar nature to what i had seen.  i know it wasn't a plane, or a helicopter, or anything that seemed to make rational sense.  \r\n\r\nsellafield, the nuclear reprocessing plant is just a few miles away and i think that this thing was taking water samples.  but my big question is why did they leave the lights on if they had been switched off i would never have witnessed them.\r\n\r\n ","distance":"21-100
