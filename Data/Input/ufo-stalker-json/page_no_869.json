continued to watch, i could make out three greyish metallic spheres.They may have been flat instead of spherical, but because of the shading i got the impression of spheres. they were moving very quickly to the north but they arced to the northwest. i lost them as they passed just to the left of cassiopeia. they were in a very tight group. the overall size was just smaller than the pleiades. there may have been 4, but i was only certain of three. their formation was not triangular...If there had been 4 it would have made a nice square. from start to finish they were visible about 4

received a phone call, and went across the street to help the old lady who lives across the street from me.  i continued to sit on the porch.  \r\n\r\nmy attention was drawn by three very bright, large pulsating lights that appeared in a triangular formation pattern about 15 degrees from the ground, ascending and moving northward towards me from due south or ssw (the direction of tampa), possibly having just arisen from mcdill afb.  as a student of aerial phenomena since childhood, i knew that formation flight indicated that they were definitely not civilian aircraft.  but what would appear as bright pulsating balls?  as i watched, the orbs continued to ascend, moving northward toward me for several seconds (that seemed much longer).  i noted that there was a dusting of clouds at a level below the orbs, and wondered if the clouds created the pulsating effect of the light, or the \"skipping\" or \"dipping\" effect, as the objects appeared to be moving in a pattern similar to a boat going over waves.  they did not move in unison, though keeping in a triangular formation.  it did not appear that the changes corresponded to the pattern of clouds.  soon the globes were at least a 45 degree angle in the sky, when one of the globes turned upward and smoothly accelerated until it was a dot among the stars, then disappeared.  after maybe 20-30 seconds, another did the same.  after what seemed a longer interval, the third executed exactly the same maneuver, streaking into the sky as it shrunk to a point among the stars, continued to shrink to nothing.  during the time i watched the \"objects\", i tried to imagine what they could not be if not advanced craft.  before the ascension, the orbs were most like flares on parachutes... they bobbed around, pulsating brighter and dimmer and possibly changing color slightly several times a second, with the edges of the luminescence seeming sometimes pinkish, sometimes yellowish, sometimes silvery, very similar to viewing burning magnesium.  after watching 3 of them appear to shoot up in the sky at what seemed impossible speeds almost directly overhead, i cannot support the supposition they were flares. \r\n\r\ni have always wanted to see a ufo, but it was hard to feel very sure these were not some kind of flare until i very closely watched the 3rd one zoom upwards and disappear, after having observed the other two going through the same process.  i was not excited or agitated except that my neighbor didn't come outside quite in time to observe the last orb.   \r\n\r\nmy father was a fighter pilot in the usaf, and i hold a private pilot certificate.  i am familiar with aerial phenomena, but in all my years of watching, have never spotted anything as anomalous as this event.  on sitting on my front porch, i often see commercial aircraft leaving tpa, and do not experience any confusion about what i am seeing.\r\n\r\ni hope you can notify me, at least in general terms if there are any other reports from last night similar to my sighting.\r\n ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

up and stayed at a higher elevation, not sure for how long. abc ran info on tv all evening. i think it was abc. they were to give us info at 11:00 news. at 11:00 they stated they did have confirmation of the event with chp. next day they reported that they were unsure what it was and the only facts they could dig up was that mather afb had never in it's history had so many craft flying in and out of base. then never heard of it again. i'm writing this now because on sci channel, their program ufo conspiracies s1/ep04, ufo swarm, shows these two woman and one boy who saw same kind of ufo. theirs was close to ground and blowing flames out the bottom. the one i saw didn't have flames but maybe because it was higher up and didn't need to. also they one they saw wasn't flashing different colored lights. it was exact shape and was bright, like the one i saw. i'm sure it's the same kind. i felt good watching this ufo. i kind of thought it or someone on board might have noticed me. it would have been easy to see me. i only felt this way for a short time. i did get a feeling that there was a brief connection somehow with it. hard to explain. did not have any ill effects from

hearing odd noises in the woods of in the distance. very odd calls that sounded like they could be a odd animal or ?? i could also hear a motor running out in the woods that sounded like a idling atv but never saw a headlight or tail light. one evening before dusk i decided to go out in the woods near a far corner fence line and sit up in a tree stand used for hunting deer in the fall and see if i could see what was in that corner of the woods at night after it got dark. i remained up in the tree stand well after the sun set approx two hours after sunset. there are no lights within a half mile of this spot in the woods. the moon had not come out yet and it had gotten so dark that i could not even see my hand placed directly in front of my face. i heard the sound of a horse whinnying it was coming from directly below me. i was in a thick area of the woods and knew it was very unlikely for a horse to of gotten into that area given it was private property, fenced in and not used by anyone except for deer hunting in the fall. i didn't plan on staying out there that long into the night and did not have a flash light i did however have a bic lighter so i lit it so i could plan my way down out of the tree to investigate the horse sound. i then climbed out of the tree and when i got to the ground started to head through the very thick brush in the direction of a mowed trail that i could take back to my camp site. i was feeling ahead of me with my arms out straight ahead and moving through the brush sometimes on my hands and knees. then the orb appeared about ten feet off the ground and about ten feet behind me. it was a very bright light. it was hovering and moving in the same direction as me but i did not feel like it was after me just following me. it was very bright but offered no light that would light my way. it was still so dark i could not see or find the trail. by now the moon had just crested the horizon in the east which is the direction of my camp i just ran through the woods toward the crested moon stumbling on fallen trees and into light brush each time i fell i looked back and it was still hovering but never got closer than ten feet from me. as i got close enough to camp there was enough light from my fire that i could run at full speed. which i did! when i reached the camp site it was gone. since that day i have dug metal out of my cheek the back of both hands the back of my neck and the base of my spine. there is also a lump under my left eyebrow that wasn't there before. i really didn't think the tiny hair like but very long wires that came out of my check and the back of my hand were related to that day. i couldn't explain it and anyone i try to explain it to makes me feel like a psycho. the more i think about it and put that and other events that have happened since that night in the woods together i'm beginning to see how they are all related to a extraterrestrial something. lol would like to talk with someone familiar with these types of events to i can get it off my chest and hopefully get an explanation for it all.","distance":"20 Feet or

glen pa.  we drove into the woods and parked the car.  we did not find the trail head we had initially set out for but set off anyway.  we hiked a few miles up the mountain before the trail ended where a tree had fallen.  we walked around and observed evidence of mountain lion den.  we had observed remains on the trail and spider holes on the ground in the area of the den.  there we left a blaze on a tree and left the trail in search of a suitable over night location.  we used a google earth image and a compass to navigate the woods to a cliff which we identified on the image.  here we set up on a large out cropped rock and began establishing a site. it was still early in the afternoon and there were few clouds in the sky. while we rested on the rock i looked up and first observed the star like object; which momentarily appeared to be stationary, but quickly began to move in apparently unnatural manner toward the tree line across the sky and over and behind us.  it did not move fast and appeared to just cruise on a vector.  the motion was smooth and with out sound or acceleration.  it did not appear to be very high at this time.  at first i did not exclaim or make my observation known because i still questioned if it was real because it was so unnatural to me.  after a few moments it reappeared high above us, travelling parallel to the tree line now and not in the direction it had disappeared originally.  at this moment i exclaimed \"o man, i see it.\"  at which time my two companions looked upward to try and observe what i had.  my male companion was unable to see it through an over hanging pine and my other companion saw it immediately and explained she had observed them before and just ignores them.  my other companion did not make an effort to change his perspective and was never able to observe the object. i continued to watch for several minutes as the vehicle flew at rapid speed in and out of my view.  it would disappear on one side of the horizon and reappear on another side.  it did this several times, almost as if to impress upon us its ability.  it made a final pass parallel to the tree, high in the sky, and i focused hard on the object attempting to see it more clearly.  i was able to make out the appearance of a tear drop shape with the widest end forward.  it appeared to be slightly a-symmetrical however, and also appeared to be spinning around the axis of travel.  after this pass the object disappeared.   \r\n\r\ni also find it relevant to include that i had experienced a close encounter of another kind several years earlier but was unable to explain it at the time.  this inspired several years of research on my part, which included learning of possible telepathic et's.  in the days before this event i had throught heavily about my past experience, the presence of et's on our planet, and mentally requested, if at all possible, a visit of this kind.  in the moments before i glimpsed upward it had occurred to my mind that it was possible they could be near. the object remained in my site, until only a short moment after i mentally acknowledged i had seen enough.  during the time it was above us i did not think or speak,only observed.  the male party that did not see the object is my closest friend and my female companion, who did also observe it, was my romantic partner.  she is an educated, open minded, and highly empathetic individual.  i have a degree in engineering, and had done previous research on this subject.  it may also be relevant to include, given the social context of our species, to include that i am of northern european descent and my partner's origins are of south west africa.  this was my first sighting, and i have not been contacted since.

closer we realized that we were getting closer to the brighter of the two lights and that it was almost directly over the road(100-150ft high). it had blinking red and white lights on the outside and bottom of the craft. we eventually drove under the craft and that's when i noticed that it had boomerang shaped wings and and was hovering motionless above us not making a sound. after passing the first craft we started getting nearer to the second light(unknowing that it too would be an unexplainable craft). it wasn't as close to us as the first one and was above the trees to our left but as we came closer to it i realized that it was dome shaped and had yellowish lights spinning around it. once we passed it it changed direction and proceeded to head in the opposite direction. the third one was also on our left about three minutes after seeing the second craft. this one was a lot darker but it had three red lights on all points of the triangle shaped craft. after several moments went

coffee house. just as we were leaving walking to our cars, i saw something out of the corner of my eye, as i turned to see a fireball/comet falling from the sky. i said quickly to my mom. oh my gosh mom look up.. do you see that!? she said yes denise i do. she then told me she has never seen a shooting star like that before. i kinda giggled at her because i have seen many in my life. this one looked to big to be a shooting star . it literally fell for at least 8-10 seconds glowing red and green colours. wow, it was cool to watch.. we hugged and parted ways. the next day i'm getting ready to go to sleep. it's around midnight or just after. i close my curtain just over half way, get into bed. i have my back turned away from the window and facing my closet which is opposite to my window. i  had my eyes closed for a moment when i noticed these bright green lights so bright that i could see them through my closed eyelids. semi freaked out i decide to open my eyes to see what was going on in my bedroom. sure enough the lights were in my bedroom bright green and dancing around my room. reminded me of the northern lights that i've seen on tv. so i just laid there quite looking up at this crazy weird light show. all of a sudden the lights that were dancing around came together making an orb like ball that hovered over my head for at least a minute. i started praying to my nana to protect me from whatever i was witnessing. the green orb started moving away from over top of my head then went back to the dancing swirling green lights that i first saw. don't ask me how but i was so nervous as to what i just saw. i remember telling myself just close your eyes and go to sleep. besides i wasn't getting out of my bed after seeing that. \r\ni woke up in the morning to go to work. my sister who lives down the street was calling me that morning and couldn't get through to me on my home line. every time see would call i would pick the phone up and it would be a dead line. later she told me that my answering machine wouldn't  pick up for her to leave a message. for about a month i had problems calling certain people and some no problem. i ended up calling the tv and phone company and asking them to see if this problem could be fixed. he did tell me that something had zapped my lines. but couldn't tell me anymore about it. \r\ncrazy eh. ?\r\nnothing has happened again

giving him some benadryl i took him upstairs to his crib. i then went down stairs turned the lights off in my kitchen and the tv off in my living room. i proceeded to my bedroom where i turned the lamp off on my wife's side of the bed, since mine has a bulb out i always use her side. as soon as i turned the lamp off i started to walk around the bed to my side, that's when i noticed two bright lights through our skylight window. they were very odd looking, solid red/orange lights which at first i thought might be an airplane. at that moment there were two side by side which the one on the right was starting to dimm as if were moving away (north) followed by the one on the left seconds later. this lasted approximately 10-15 seconds from when i first noticed them. after i could not see them anymore i got in bed. still thinking about what i saw and stairing out our skylight window i then saw another red/orange light, this one seemed closer than the first two i saw. it was heading north on a straight path, it's hard to say how close it was, but was not moving like any man made object. the best description would be an orb. i then grabbed my phone and went out my back door trying to get a video of it. i took a short video noticing one after another appearing in the south and heading north. it was pitch black and i felt as if my phone was not going to capture what i was seeing. i ran back inside and got my digital camera. taking still photos of several of them. this whole event lasted about 5 minutes. most of the photos look like nothing but zooming in after its sheets some weird things. a couple of photos that i took show lines as if you were writing your name in the sky with a sparkler. i know other people in the neighborhood saw this too, i heard in the distance of someone saying what is that. as an estimated guess i saw about 10-15 separate orbs.

(i have over 25 years of business in aviation) i thought maybe it could be a helicopter but they don't move like this did. i dragged the dogs home and yelled at my wife that there was a ufo outside and went back outside. it was stationery with a light lavender color. as the sun was coming up the light was losing it's intensity. it changed to lavender and started moving north. we could no longer see it due to our trees block the view. i was in awe.\r\nadditional witness wife - i was on the couch with my computer tablet when my husband came in exclaiming there was a ufo. i thought he was joking but saw the dogs still had their leads on and that he had gone back outside. i joined him and looked west a saw a bright white star. i asked if that was it and he said yes. i questioned him again to make sure i was seeing the same thing he was seeing. it was the only thing i could see in the the sky and i was unimpressed thinking it was venus. i asked him if he was sure it wasn't venus and he said, \"yes, it changed color and it moved.\"\r\ni observed a stationary bright white light, not twinkling like a star and it was between 20-30 degrees above the horizon. i trust my husband so i stayed and watched; barefooted in my pajamas (49 degrees outside). while watching i was trying to figure out how to work the camera on my tablet. i took a couple of pictures. then the object suddenly (as when you turn on light switch) turned the deepest prettiest lavender. it was a flat light. right after the color change it moved north until i could no longer see it due to the trees. when it started moving i changed the camera to video. we moved to where we could see past the trees but no longer saw the object. this event was a \"wow\". that is the only word that comes to mind to describe how i felt - wow. that sight of that lavender light is staying with me. i grew up on and near military bases and i have never seen anything like this. i checked my tablet camera and was very disappointed. my amateurish-ness and inexperience with the tablet/camera is shown very well. plus i was excited while trying to walk on sticks and stones with my barefeet. in the picture look towards the middle. you may need to magnify the pic. there is a white light. at that time -6:45 a.M. it was darker outside than it appears in the picture. the video is very short and very bad. you will need to look to the right of the bottom branches. there you will see the bright light moving north.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":63165,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.260521514733746,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02082015-0010","longitude":-110.8352312881208,"occurred":1423406100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1423422279000,"summary":"Changing colors, movement bright light.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/63165_submitter_file1__20150208064921.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/63165_submitter_file2__20150208064938.mp4"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"85715","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Tucson, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:60764"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":869}
