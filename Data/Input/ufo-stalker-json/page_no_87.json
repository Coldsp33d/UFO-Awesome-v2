Collins","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"    was sitting in personal automobile in parking lot outside of workplace, awaiting time for start of shift, in 2nd row of spaces away from the building, facing westward.  at moment, very light breeze from north-to-south, sun was approximately 65 degrees above horizon in south, south-west, with no clouds in general region at the time, but with noticeable atmospheric haze present.  while waiting in the parking lot, casually glanced around to observe general surroundings, and noticed a quite large formation of canadian geese approaching area from the northwest, heading to southeast, at approximately 1,500 ft. altitude.  noticed that the presence of the geese themselves made the atmospheric haze more noticeable, and they appeared to be skimming just beneath the haze level.  while watching the passage of the geese, attention was drawn to one of the birds among the grouping's longest trailing lines in the formation attempt to break formation, and pass the bird positioned just ahead of it, in attempt to start its own \"formation\" feature to the grouping.  maneuver caused minor disruption in the formation for short period, and while watching them jostle for resumption of former positioning, i noticed something light-colored pass directly \"above\" the involved geese, as seen from my angle of observation.  object appeared to be traveling at approximately 5,000 ft. altitude, on an east-to west trajectory, traveling at approximately 200 mph, displaying a continuous rate of travel, with no apparent adjustments to altitude, speed, or trajectory.  object did not make any detectable noise, noticeable over the ambient background noise associated with the general area.  object was observed to be traversing over the area well within the layer of atmospheric haze, as its passage created a noticeable \"wake-wash\" turbulence effect behind it in the haze it passed through.  the flock of geese did not appear to show any reaction to the object's proximity/passage.  when initially spotted, object's range was approximately 1-1.5 miles distant, positioned slightly to the west, northwest of my position, heading westward, and lost sight of the object when at approximately 2-2.5 miles distance, at approximate 40-45 degrees above horizon.  object was whitish in coloration, and upon initial notice, was mentally dismissed as potential gull/pelican/stork-type avian at little higher altitude than the geese formation being watched.  when object was brought under more focused attention & observation, it had the appearance of an upright-standing (longer length axis perpendicular to horizon) cylindrical shape with rounded ends, with the bottom rounding less defined and \"shallower\", than the top.  at the range and altitude perceived, object appeared to be approximately 20-30 ft. in vertical height, with approximately 10-15 ft. horizontal width.  object appeared to be either naturally colored a somewhat dullish white, or was dimly illuminated that shade.  with the sun-glare in the sky, and the atmospheric haze present, object's coloration made it somewhat difficult to detect, and if i had not been observing the geese formation at the time that it passed over, would likely not have noticed it in the area at all.  every approximately 1.25 seconds, the object would \"flash\" to display more intense level of coloration/illumination by approximately 3x, which would last for approximately .5 second, before flashing back to the original, dimmer level.  flashing sequence was displayed throughout entire sighting, and was maintained at a steady, rhythmic rate.  sighting of object was lost at the end of the observation period, when it was \"suddenly\" no longer detectable to eyesight, with the trailing haze layer disturbance/turbulence ceasing without any detectable sudden increase/agitation to the haze disturbance.

if this sighting report was sent previously. i am unsure if the first report went through properly).\r\n\r\nthe photo was taken at 5:54 am on november 23, 2017, in madrid, spain. i was up early because of jetlag and was walking in the town. the photo was taken in the square of puerta del sol in the middle of madrid. i took the photo facing south from behind a statue (because it says \"madrid\" on it) and i was trying to get the shot of the statue with the frame of the christmas tree and the clock tower building.  it is possible that when i framed the shot the ufos were behind the christmas tree and only came into view (moved west) when i was busy making sure the clock tower building was in the shot.\r\n\r\nat the time of the photo, i did not notice anything in the sky (i was not paying attention to the sky, as i did not think anything was there. also, there were several revelers in the area still partying from the night before, and making sure of my own safety i was keeping one eye on them and just quickly took the shot). my camera was just set to \"automatic\". it was only later the next day when i was going through my photos that i noticed the strange lights in the sky in the photo. at first i thought it was maybe just street lamps (as the street lamps in the area have either 4 or 2 lights on them) but even from the ufo photo i can see the lamps are much farther down. i then thought that maybe it was some odd reflection of the street lamps. however, i am outside and not in a store or restaurant (it was nearly 6 am at the time, and nothing is open at that time to my knowledge). although there is a christmas tree decoration, there is no glass there to reflect the street lamp lights. to check that it was not actually some kind of odd reflection, i went back the next day to take photos of the area. there is nothing in the sky to reflect the light from the lamps. there have never been photos of strange or odd things like this taken with this camera and lens before, so i can only conclude that it is a photo of ufos. thank

october, 2017 my wife and i came home between 8 – 12 pm. we both went into the tv room to wind down for the night and catch up on the news. within minutes a balloon we had in the basement came hovering, floating about one foot to 18 inches, smoothly, equidistance, from the kitchen ceiling, it started from the hallway. it  lowered itself to the entrance of the tv room, and just stood there hovering and fluttering in the air above us. the balloon hoovered in front and above us for about five to ten minutes – like purposely seeking attention. we were both looking at each other like in disbelief and at the balloon. the balloon then floated gracefully, keeping about a foot equidistance from all overhead surfaces like it was being remotely controlled or programmed by a computer. it was only two of us in the house, and we were both sitting on the couch watching tv. when it left the tv room, i remember we looked at each other in disbelief and i commented “it's an alien.” \r\nthis experience truly fascinated me. i do watch alien shows on h2 channel. many times in the days following this experience, i would instinctively put my hands together, like one would in pray, when i pass this balloon. about one to two weeks later it settled on the floor of the living room almost deflated of helium. i pumped air (from a bicycle tire pump) into this anagram balloon and sit it in a corner, on the floor, in the living room. \r\n(my wife said the balloon was in the basement, from our daughter's wedding of august 19th/2017).\r\nonly about two days later, about (10 - 12) pm, we (my wife and i) came in from outside. as i was taking out my jacket we saw another smaller anagram balloon floating, in the hallway, about waste high, around the area of the stairway leading to the basement and the laundry room. again, i remember asking her 'where are these things coming from?' and again she said they were in the basement. \r\nwe both went in the tv room to wind down. about 15 to 30 minutes later i decided to call it a night, head to bed. when i got to the hallway, the balloon was now hovering (like the one before) about 12 – 18 inches from the ceiling, in front of the stairs leading to the second floor. it then moved towards the front door, where i usually go to to switch the outside / lawn lights off and check that the door is locked properly and the curtains on the front door had to be brought down, that night. i now begin to follow the balloon. this actually startled me, i stopped and wondered how this could happen. amazingly the balloon then moved at a steady, slow, smooth motion and hovered over the entrance in the hallway, leading to the laundry room and garage entrance, like,  again, reminding me that i had to check the door between the laundry room and the garage. this i do every night. when i came back from checking the laundry room / garage door, it was hovered over the washroom door, where i had to go and clean my teeth. \r\n\r\nwhen i came out of the washroom, it got so much more bizarre, interesting & fascinating.  \r\n\r\nwhen i came out of the washroom the balloon was hovering over the entrance to the stair leading to the second floor three bedrooms and home office room. on the second floor our (my wife & i)    bedroom is on the right, straight ahead is my smaller daughter (29 years) bedroom and to my left is my office room and my elder daughter (33 years) bedroom.  [ our daughters do not live with us anymore ] i followed the balloon up the stairs, to the second floor hallway, keeping a distance of about five to six feet behind. the balloon floated to the left, and hoovered just above the office door entrance. this reminded me that i had to close the blinds and curtains in my office room – i usually forget to do this three out of four days. when i came out of the office room it was hovering over the entrance of my elder daughter's room, again, reminding me to close the curtains there, in that room. as though waiting for me outside my elder daughter's bedroom, and having purpose, i came out following the balloon as it glides its way down the hall, gently lowering itself to enter our bedroom, never touching any surface until it sat on my wife's side of our bed. \r\ni sat on my side of the bed as i usually do and undress to my underwear and went under the covers. the balloon stayed above the covers on my wife's side of the bed. i did peep at it a few times within the next ten minutes or so. \r\nabout 15 – 30 minutes later i heard my wife making her way up the stairs, by this time i was like between sleep and wake, i peeped the balloon in time to see it lift about six inches to one foot off the bed and gently moved to the back and side of the bed. i moved the covers of my face. when my wife came into the room, she grabbed / snatched the balloon, walked to the door, threw it in the hallway and closed our bedroom door. \r\nthe next morning the balloon was in my office room suspended, hovering below the ceiling . it stayed there for weeks, moving, floating, hovering as though playing games with me. i never close my office room door – it never left. \r\nabout three weeks after being in my office it was moving around on the floor. i put some helium into it. the balloon stayed suspended for about one or two weeks and finally lodge itself between a shelving unit and a wall. i thought it was a nice place to leave it. about two days later it was not there. i look around the house for it, but did not find it. one night, about five days after it disappeared from sight,  when i came out of the main floor washroom it was like sitting on the living room floor. i stared at it for about 30 seconds to a minute and then it started to move at a steady pace, directly towards the first bigger balloon i had sat in a corner, on the floor, in the living room. the next day i asked my wife if she brought the balloon there (not that it made much difference)? she shrugged me off, saying she had no time for that.  \r\na bit more has happened since then. \r\nthere is a third anagram balloon.\r\n\r\ni had a mild heart attack last night (30th november, 2017), i told no one else, not even my wife of this heart issue or my experience with the balloons. i decided i must document this experience before it's too late.\r\n \r\ni will be happy for some explanations, answers, speculation to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. i will like to know who or what was controlling those balloons? how they did it?\r\n2. could it have been a prank, played on me? i love the show ' just for laughs gags'.\r\n3. are there aliens amongst us? did aliens use the balloons as toys? \r\n4. was it a message? the small balloons said ' love always and forever '\r\n5. does 'man' have the technology to have balloons perform, independently, on their own, like this?\r\n6. i believe if the first balloon had not come along, i would not have followed the second balloon. and the experiences would have been lost.\r\n7. \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":88481,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.860715611569084,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-12012017-0017","longitude":-79.23459204026825,"occurred":1508097600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1512162789000,"summary":"Anagram balloons exhibiting supernatural powers.","tags":["lights","floating","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1512354346754,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"L3S4S2","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":47,"locationName":"Markham, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7982"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"12/1/17, apx 1730, clear night, crisp air, temp 30f, zero wind. visibility for 100 miles.  looking ene on a clear night with full moon rising. i noticed 3 distinctive stars/lights. these stars/lights were brighter than normal, in shape of triangle. i thought to myself that they looked to be moving very slow ene to the ese. i looked back down to pick up some items. less than 1-2 seconds, finally registered that this was odd. i look back up, no longer 3 stars but now only one and that star was was almost being blocked by some pine trees in my fornt yard. since i never moved an inch, this would confirm the movement. i moved quickly 60 feet to get back into a clear view, almost tripping over a rock, and the last star/light was gone. my only thought was did the light from the moon block out these \"stars\" but yet i seen them clear as day with the same moon less than 1 min earlier. whole event less than 1 min. spent 15 minutes looking for something to make sense of what i just seen. strange indeed.

after, i had errands to run and forgot about this event until my memory card was almost full... that is 3 months later. so, on november 27th i went into my pictures to clear some in order to create more space on my phone's memory card. seeing how cool that cloud was on the pictures i decided to send them to a friend of mine to have a look at that cool event.\r\n\r\nlooking at the photos on my phone i only thought the round thing was a bird flying by. i am into ufos and did not want my enthusiasm to make me see only what i wanted to see. so i rationalised it at the time. but my opinion changed when my friend was looking at them on her computer and she mentioned that there was some things in the sky that were unusual. so, looking at my pictures on a computer screen we both think there is at least one ufo on a few of the pictures with that weird coloured cloud. maybe up to 5.\r\n\r\ni never noticed anything but the bizarre cloud while i was taking the pictures. i wish i had, but i was very focused on it.\r\n\r\nwe are pretty sure that there is at least one ufo on the pictures. as it is round, perfect circle within another circle. this one we are pretty certain is not a bird flying by. also, it appears that there was two others that were in formation farther away and maybe 2 more.\r\n\r\nthis weird \"cloud\" was a real oddity in itself as it was not moving like\r\nthe other clouds. this cloud lasted about 35 minutes! i wish i had\r\nnoticed the ufos then to film them but i guess it was not meant to be.\r\n\r\nthe pictures were taken with my one year old iphone se. if you look at\r\nall my pictures you will see that my lense was clean. also, i will join all the original pictures unaltered and a few that i adjusted the contrast and exposure, and circled the possible ufos.\r\n\r\ni may never know what all these were but i can say that i found this very unusual and very \"cool\".\r\n\r\nhere are the coordinates of the field where the ufos showed up:\r\n\r\n     45.229400, -74.804832\r\n\r\ni have a few more pictures but was not able to upload them. please contact me if you are interested. thank you.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:35:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":88479,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.2340587,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-12012017-0015","longitude":-74.8090237,"occurred":1504033200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1512155792000,"summary":"Weird coloured cloud and at least one and up to 5 ufos over fields in ontario in august 2017","tags":["photo","video","ufo","light","contact"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1512354048376,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/88479_submitter_file1__6.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/88479_submitter_file2__7.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/88479_submitter_file3__8.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/88479_submitter_file4__9.JPG"],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":94,"locationName":"Maxville, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7984"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Elora","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Me and my wife were outside &#128684; and were looking at the stars and noticed a airplane flying with blinking lights go across the sky. i pulled up flight radar and showed her it was a boeing 747 travelling from to california to georgia. after it passed she spotted 2 lights 1 coming from south and one coming from southeast and thought they were airplanes so i checked the radar and it showed nothing but an airplane that was just coming in our line of sight the 2 lights were not blinking and i said shouldn't they have beacons? after, we witnessed one of the lights converge into to other that was travelling south to north to form one solid light. we continued to watch amazed at it for 10 to 12 seconds before it disappeared being tailed by another jumbo jet with white and red blinking lights.
