lights reflecting off the power lines, which are in front of the trees). this was all traveling west, but then it took several sharp directional changes--a streak north, toward me, then southwest, north again (i had to look over my right shoulder to follow it here as it was well behind and across the street), then a couple quick changes, by now west and paralleling the coastline, then one more sharp turn south and out of sight. this was too high to see anything but the light trail, obviously very high. a couple minutes later, a huge, low-flying plane (i assume military from macdill afb) came lumbering south, which was a stark contrast to the higher and incredibly faster object i'd just seen. no opportunity to try to catch it on my phone as the whole thing only took about a minute and traveled too fast to capture. this was clearly not a natural phenomenon, given the incredible flight path. i didn't sense anything from it, just my own awe to have seen something so elegant. i only wish i had a better grasp of distance. here on the west coast of florida, the challenger explosion looked like it was maybe five miles away. this obviously covered a huge distance in a very short

secs).  i could still hear the helicopter moving northeasterly after it was out of my sight.  the triangle object was much greater in size than the helicopter (6-8 times the size of the 'copter,

triangular positions).  it was also illuminated enough that i could see that the \"object\" had height and width.  the \"object\" was  dull blackish/gray color, similar to a black primer color.  the helicopter had flashing lights on it as one would expect it to have.  only difference being that i couldn't distinguish any markings on it, being it was also dark in color.

i was parked on the topmost floor (#4) of the parking garage. i noticed chemtrails were being made over atlanta/decatur.. again.. it's pretty much a weekly occurrence. and i typically get out of my car to take photos of them. perhaps some day they will become a scrapbook.. because otherwise, no one that can do anything about them take them seriously anyway. after i cleaned the lens, i took about 4 photos using my nexus 4, with the default camera app. then put my smartphone back in my pocket, and went inside the facility for my daily appointment.\r\n\r\nwhen i got home that afternoon i took a look at the photos. and wow.. 1st time i *ever* accidently caught a ufo in a photo. interesting thing is.. there are 2 photos of the same area of the sky.. about 3 seconds apart. now you see it.. now you don't. if it were something on the lens, it would have showed in both photos. not the case. the moon was on the opposite side of the sky, it wasn't full yet, and it was much larger than this object anyway. it was near noon.. so no stars were visible as well.. as you can see from the photos.\r\n\r\nso.. my theory is.. it either cloaked.. or zipped into another dimension, wormhole, etc. and

videotape it. but when i got out there the aircraft was gone. but their was an passenger plane or atleast what looked like a passenger plane soon afterwords. i stayed out there for a few more minits to try and see it agean but didn't have any luck. the second time i saw it it was before school, this time heading north. i staired up at it for about two minites until i looked down and looked back up agean and lost track agean. both times i saw it by looking up in the sky as i do every day. and i know i wasn't seeing things becuase on the news their were the same type of objects exept their were two this time. as well with my case, they were both over a school as

our way home from eating when i saw it in the sky thinking not much of it at first. then when i pointed it out and all 3 of us were trying to figure out what \"we\" have that could move like it did. one of my friends with us was a firm no such thing as aliens or ufo's person and he was dumbfounded and boggled by what all 3 of our eyes were seeing. i was in the middle of a small truck my friend to my right \"the passenger side\" tried to get this recorded on his phone which was of good quality but just couldn't make out the lights in the sky. so we just watched it while driving this stretch of country road, while in amazement of what we was seeing (although) looking back we coulda crashed cause of those lights. after 6-10 minutes of watching these spherical shaped triangular arrangement of lights dance in the sky going up and down side to side but in uniform and then one by one the lights almost seemed to flicker out then after they were all gone we saw one appear again then 5-10 seconds later it also left and nothing showed back up after that. we tried ever reasonable explanation but i can tell you as a logical person not quick to rush to judgment that this was something no one unless maybe government high ups know what this object could be... i'm not saying i know it was alien  but all 3 of us who witnessed it all agreed if it's not out of this world object then it has to be super high tech government tech like has never before been seen by at least the publics naked eye. i had saw the exact same object on  film on television not long after it happened and funny enough the video was right around halloween just the same as us but two year after the fact. except the one i saw on tv was witnessed by hundreds not just 3, and filmed and i believe it was just north of me in michigan if i remember right. it was caught on camera eerie and alien. also i know a lot of people i know and on the video were saying the way it went out had to be a flare, but i know from simple gravity once flares are released they don't move in uniform up and down and side to side.
