States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It happened on may 25, 2011 at around 6:50 pm. one of my roommates and i were sitting out in the backyard talking while i was having a cig.\r\n\r\n[our house was located on e 13th street between rosemont and swan. our backyard faced north over tucson towards the catalina foothills and mt. kimball.]\r\n\r\nas i was sitting there, i noticed a black object coming over the mountains into the valley. it was flying south towards my area of town. my friend and i were still talking as i kept watching it get closer.\r\n\r\nusually when i see a black object in the sky, my first expectation is it's a military stealth fighter or bomber. maybe a black helicopter. not many aircraft are the color this object was and just south of me was davis-monthan afb which it was making a beeline for. it's not often i get to see one of those planes, so i was hoping it was one of them. it was moving along at about the average speed i see most helicopters fly.\r\n\r\ni couldn't identify it though. the object had no defined shape that i could make out at first. it was like a morphing shape-shifting blob of black. the black blob was roughly the size of a rice grain at arms length. it's altitude i would guess was between 500 - 1,000 feet. \r\n\r\ni was now curious as to what this thing was. i decided to run into the house for a pair of binoculars i own, bushnell 10x50s. i hurried back outside. the object was still in the sky, but further along its flight path now and closer to me. i used my binoculars to zoom in on the object. when i located it, i was at a lost to explain or even begin to understand what i was seeing.\r\n\r\nit was a cluster of 6-7 hexagonal shaped saucers all of which were charcoal-black in color. much like the stealth color. they were spinning on their axis, making a full rotation every few seconds. as well, they were all rotating at about the same speed around this intense purple light at the center of this cluster. the purple was light, almost pink, as opposed to being a dark shade like violet. the light didn't appear to emanate from any solid object, yet it seemed to be responsible for holding this cluster together.\r\n\r\ni was shocked, impressed and a little scared. i've seen all kinds of sci-fi alien movies with saucers and ufos. i have never seen anything even remotely close to what this looked like. i couldn't imagine what such a thing would be used for. it was really bizarre!\r\n\r\nthe black saucers were rotating around this purple light much like satellites do around earth. of each saucer, one hexagon face always pointed at the light and the other away from it. like the moon does as it revolves around us. all the while, none of them were colliding into each other despite all of them rotating in every which way.\r\n\r\ni couldn't see anything that resembled a cockpit. i didn't get the impression that this thing was manned. simply from the way it flew, i don't see how a pilot would be feasible. \r\n\r\nthe entire time, i'm describing what i'm seeing to my roommate. i asked him to take a look at it through the binoculars, but he declined. he had showed no interest in seeing it or hearing about it.\r\n\r\ni had my smart phone on me and decided to take a picture of it before it was gone. it doesn't take very good images so i didn't mess with it upon first realizing this is a ufo. my phone was an lg optimus s. the camera is 3.2 megapixel. my zoom was set at 4 mm.\r\n\r\ni only took one picture of it, more or less to have a date and time stamp of the sighting and show the black spot at least. it was taken at 6:53 pm and shows the eastern sky from the backyard. the ufo was passing over e broadway blvd at this point somewhere between craycroft and wilmot rd. it was still heading towards dmafb. from me, the ufo was about 2 miles away at it's closest. i never heard any sound. most jets i would hear this close.\r\n\r\ni continued watching it through my binoculars. i moved to the front yard when the ufo became impossible to see because of the roof blocking my line of sight. i eventually lost visual of it to the south of me. it was around e 22nd st by then. i presume it had to be flying into military airspace at some point.","distance":"Over One

first: but a small light began growing larger. then it stopped at about half the size of a noontime sun in the sky. it was a red orange color. then a dark spot in the center appeared and came toward us. it grew larger and more clear as it came closer. it was smaller then the space shuttle; but similar shape. it had strange markings like shapes triangles and circles mostly. it flew very slowly overhead i remember thinking that i could have thrown a rock and hit it. everyone seemed to be frozen as if we were unable to move. but never took her eyes off of the object.We watched it go over slowly then disappear in the easterly direction after it disappeared we turned to look at the fireball and it had vanished.The weirdest part is that no one who witnessed it will admit to it not even to me. they all ignore what they saw! this is not the first time i have seen a fireball. i have seen a fireball on two other occasions.The first time was with a farmer i worked for when i was 16. the next time was a few years before the one i just described in the beginning.But this was the first time i ever saw anything come out of the fireball.When we went back inside the house we were all amazed at how long we had been out there.Several people asked that were not outside where we had been; but none of us had a response.Since this time i have had an odd feeling that i will not only see it again but everyone will witness it.The object that came out of the fireball made no sound and the fireball itself made no sound either. i had heard that other people had witnessed a similar account of the fireball but i have not heard about anyone seeing the object that came out of it.I have given this a lot of thought over the years and often thought perhaps the object was something made by our military because of the shape of the ship that came out of the fireball. i do not know for sure what it was but i don't believe it is from this world.I would like to have met the beings inside; but that did not happen at least not to my memory. the strangest thing is no one thought to take a picture and no one spoke or even maybe sound as the object went past us.I hope to be contacted by mufon so they can shed some light on what i observed.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hello. i live in tempe, arizona, a city in the phoenix metroplex area. i am a graphic designer who has lived in the area for 5 years. my mother was also present for this event. my parents are both licensed pilots and i personally have spent hundreds of hours flying with them in various aircraft throughout my life. although i am no expert, i feel confident in what i saw and believe that i witnessed something very unusual. along with this report, i submitted a report to nuforc, contacted media, and made graphics of what i saw using my abilities as a graphic designer.\r\n\r\nthis event occurred during the superbowl here in the phoenix area on february 1st, 2015, at 7:40 pm. i was cleaning up my house and was taking some trash out to the backyard. on my way over to the trash can, i looked up at the moon which, at the time, was in the upper eastern part of the sky. it was at this moment that i saw a curious-looking craft heading north some degrees above of the moon. relative to the full moon, it was just slightly smaller than the moon. this object stood out to me immediately because it was not following the flight path which all planes follow on their approach into nearby sky harbor intl. airport. planes flying into sky harbor at night typically fly in east to west as our runways run in this orientation. if a plane is flying over this airspace, its altitude is typically very high as to not disturb the lower traffic. this craft’s altitude appeared to be relatively low, around 7,000-10,000 feet or so and well within a mile from me to the east, making it unusual from the start.\r\n\r\nas i observed this craft going north-bound, i tried to logically make out what it was. it had one unblinking white-slightly yellow light on the bottom of it. this light appeared to illuminate areas of the actual structure of the craft, which had a reddish-orangish tint to it and what appeared to be faint horizontal lines going across. the areas of the craft that weren't illuminated were dark but slightly lighter than the sky. this gave me a general sense of the shape and outline of the craft, which seemed triangular. the outline was not clearly defined. it seemed fuzzy somehow. it also seemed to shift and change shape slightly but i am not sure if this was due to my mind's perception trying to fit it into a known object, such as a plane.\r\n\r\ni stared at this object, transfixed, and as stated above tried to logically perceive it as a plane, thinking that the illuminated areas were perhaps the tail section and/or wings of a southwest jet, which are commonly painted with orangish colors. however, this object just didn’t fit the description of a jet. there were no navigation lights, it made no sound, and the shape that i could make out seemed to be triangular in shape. the illuminated areas seemed to perhaps be the two back points of this triangle.\r\n\r\nonce i ruled it out as an aircraft, i thought that perhaps i was viewing a very large satellite and that the illuminated areas were solar panels. many images that i have seen of satellites show their solar panels to be of a rusty-orangish color, similar to what i was seeing. this, too, just did not fit. at this moment, i noticed that the object was beginning to turn. it made a smooth 90 degree turn in a sharp arc going from north to west in seconds. as it was turning, my view of it changed. before it turned, i had been looking up at it, seeing it from the bottom. now as it was turning (and north of me at that point) i was seeing it from the side. it was at this view that i could see two lights. i am not sure if this was actually an additional light on the craft, or if it was part of the same light i saw on the bottom. perhaps because of the new view point, i was seeing the bottom and top of this light, split horizontally by the craft itself. it was at this point that i noticed how fast this thing was going and how fast it had made the turn. it seemed to accelerate towards the end of this turn. i remember thinking at that moment that a commercial jet would've been torn apart if it made a turn like that at that speed.\r\n\r\nas this thought was occurring to me, i heard the thunderous sound of jet engines from behind. as soon as i looked above me, two military jets flew almost directly overhead. they each had one sole blinking white strobe light, very bright, and no other navigation lights that i could see. i remember thinking that these aircraft (and their single blinking strobe) looked kind of ominous to me. they were around the same altitude as the mysterious craft, and i questioned if this was an escort of some sort. it was clearly not an escort, as the jets were about 15 seconds behind the craft when they came into my view and were flying aggressively. when they came into view they were heading north-northwest- again, very unusual for this area as this is sky harbor's airspace. they also turned west in pursuit of the object, and despite their tremendous flying capabilities, could not make nearly as sharp a turn to the west. their turn was much wider as illustrated in the map graphic i made.\r\n\r\ni've seen strange things in the sky before, but never with military jets following it. as soon as i saw military jets literally chasing this thing, i became extremely astonished, excitable and somewhat frantic. i called out to my mother, who came outside to witness the aerial pursuit as all three flew west, coincidentally directly towards the glendale stadium where the superbowl was simultaneously taking place. she, too, witnessed the two military jets and the object. the object at this time appeared as an unwavering light and she did not see the structural details that i witnessed when it had flown overhead. \r\n\r\nwe watched the object and the jets fly ever westward and the jet noise increased at this time, perhaps due to the jets afterburners. we watched all three crafts until they were out of view. it appeared that they flew slightly south, and then west once more beyond the horizon. the entire sighting lasted under 2 minutes. it may sound strange, but the next day i remember having a feeling that the object was saying hi.\r\n\r\ni want to note that because of the superbowl, two blackhawk helicopters and two military jets were flying around the valley that week for security reasons during the superbowl. i myself, along with the rest of phoenix, were aware of their presence and purpose that week because of local media reports providing citizens awareness in case we saw them flying around that week. i had seen and become quite familiar with these military aircraft all week. the jets that i saw pursuing this object were not the two patrol jets doing security for the superbowl. soon after the sighting, i saw the two patrol jets flying in from the north going south near sky harbor at a slightly higher altitude. at the time, the jets and object could actually still be seen (barely) far out west of my location. my mom and i both had the feeling that the jets we had seen had possibly been scrambled for the expressed purpose of intercepting this object.\r\n\r\nthank you so much for your time in reading my very long description. i wanted to be as thorough as possible. i very much appreciate that there are places where these kind of things can be reported. please feel free to contact me for any further information. i would love to know if there is radar data or tower communication from that night.. once again, sincere thanks!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Other,

sky. when i look at the sky i saw a one star like thing blinking very rapidly. i suddenly stopped and watched that object to know what it was. i noticed it was moving here and there. some times it glows very brightly. at that time i saw that object illuminating with blue, red, and white colors in a rapidly changing manner. i shouted to the others of our house to come and see this object. and all my family members saw this object. they also excited by watching this. i quickly went to the house and got my digital camera. and i got lots of photos. but only few of photos captured the object. after that i ran to the in front of the house and got another photos. there also few photos captured the object. we saw that this object always move up and down and right and left in a random manner.\r\n            i think that object is at a very high level from the ground because when mists like clouds are coming towards that, the object was disappeared for a short time. after clouds passed away that was reappeared. \r\n            this object appeared for about 45 minutes. at 8.45 pm lots of clouds came and start a rain. at that time we went by our vehicle to a field which we

there.\r\n           on that day i plugged the camera to my laptop and analyzed them. when i saw those photos i really disappointed. but when i zoomed those photos i saw a red colored spot like object appeared on that photo. i analyzed another photo and when it zoomed i saw white colored spot like object and also that zoomed image is very different from the other zoomed images because there has four black dots around that white colored spot. after that day i analyzed other photos also and i saw blue colored spot like object.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

i-5 to castle rock from a delivery in woodland.  it was about 7pm and we were about two miles from passing through kalama when i noticed a really bright \"star\" on the horizon to the east, only far too low to be a star with such intense lighting. we always have our eyes to the sky and have seen our fair share of unidentified objects in the sky.  quite often in this area, actually.  well, we both seen it as it was stationary and did not move the whole time we observed it.  about a mile down the road i pulled off at the todd road exit and pulled over and parked on the on-ramp before entering the freeway again.  we sat there watching it for about 15 minutes and it would emit different colors of lighting, not beam like, but like the glow of a star.  while we were sitting there observing this object, i started to take pictures of it with a samsung galaxy s5 active smart phone.  i took 4 or 5 pictures and then the camera started to malfunction with a majority of the screen being black, about 2/3 of the screen, then only a couple seconds later the whole screen turned black and the phone froze.  we sat there for a few more minutes and about 3 minutes since the phone froze, it started working normally again, but we did not shoot anymore pictures.  a couple minutes after the phone coming back on the object was still stationary, just as it was the entire time of observation, so we decided to hit the road.  when we got home i saved the pictures to my computer and opened within basic photoviewer that comes with windows 7.  i blew the images up and these two things are what i see.  i could not see 2 objects while physically observing it from the freeway, but they did show up in these pictures.  i was amazed to say the least.  \r\n i added another 2 pictures of a different object observed 2 days prior from here at home, [address removed/cms/dr]\r\none is inverted and the other is the original photo.  i'm not 100% but i think it was around 10pm our time.  this is similar to the above as far as i thought it was just a star looking object, only an out of place star, until i got it on computer.
