disappeared.\r\n\r\ni pulled myself together and gave myself a good talking to and tried to convince myself i had imagined it. i took my tablet that also has a camera and i aimed it in the direction

wide open mouth quietly sighing next to you. i do not know for sure if it was from this object, but the noise occurred just as the lone red light (the other lights all went out upon it moving and the simultaneous noise i heard) began to drift straight west at what i would estimate as jogging speed, maybe 5mph.\r\ni decided to get to work and not follow it. \r\nwhen i got to work, a miracle

sanford, nc. as we drove we saw far off in the distance ahead of us a collection of red and white lights, it looked like lights you would see on a cluster of radio towers.  as we drove toward the lights we noticed that the lights were getting closer to us and that they were not lights from radio towers, they were attached to individual crafts, the crafts were flying in a straight line towards us, maybe 1000-1500 feet in the air, they were black isosceles triangle shapes with slightly longer sides than the rear of the craft. each had a single bright white light in each of the corners and a slightly larger red light in the center. the vehicles were very large and if they were 1000-1500 feet in the air i would estimate the length to be about 600 feet and the width across the back to be about 400 feet. as the first craft approached it flew directly over my truck and made an angular turn towards the east, the second craft approached and made the exact same turn at the exact speed at the exact point where the first had always maintaining the exact distance from the first craft.  there was a gap of perhaps 2000 feet between the second craft and the third craft, the third craft was followed by a fourth craft. all four were identical and silent. the third and fourth crafts maintained the same distance between them the first and second had demonstrated then copied the exact movements of the first and second crafts with the same precision. it was like two sets of pilots performing the same flight plan with incredible precision. once the four crafts had made the turn to the east and they resumed the straight line formation, they shot forward in the blink of an eye and came to stop or slowed back down to the original rate of speed we had observed. i would guess they traveled 6 or 7 miles in less than a second without a sound and then were able stop or slow without noticeable braking, it was just start stop, no gradual acceleration or deceleration. no noticeable change in altitude, they appeared to be hovering or slowly trolling the skies over the small town of broadway, nc. while the crafts were still approaching us one after another i told my nephew to pull over as i wanted to get out and watch them but he would not stop the truck as we drove with the crafts low on the horizon we lost sight of them behind the trees. he was very freaked out by the events.  i cannot stop myself from scanning the night skies since then. we were close to my house at the time we saw them, when we got home we replayed the story a dozen times trying to make sense of it. to this day i believe i saw something either extra-terrestrial or some sort of government ultra secret high technology like nothing this world has seen before. i am betting on the ets though, this was far too advanced for us yet.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

in-law's house after spending the holidays there, we went to park the car in the garage four blocks from our house.\r\n\r\nthe garage is a large open sky lot located in camino maldonado (big avenue) esq. roma next to the police caminera (highway patrol).\r\n\r\nafter parking the car, we were walking towards the exit and asked my wife if she had grabbed the house keys, she returned to the car to look for the key's as she had forgotten, i stay with my 7 month old daughter on her stroller standing in the middle of the lot.\r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and there were three small cloud's with a strange elongated shape and that seemed to be very low. \r\n\r\n\r\nas i admired them i notice motion from my right (i was looking camino maldonado to the south). \r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a formation of birds flying because there was no noise.\r\n\r\nhe got behind the first cloud when he was back in sight i thought it was a plane but notice some white spots in a v-shaped pattern and thought again it's just birds.\r\n\r\nthen he passed behind the second cloud and when it came out i was already following with my eyes  to the east where the moon shone and the sky was really clear.\r\n\r\nso when it came out i could clearly see the silhouette of the object, the color was black or charcoal gray opaque with light absorbing coat like a b2, had a v-shape but with a wing half or a third length of the other in a very distinctive way.\r\n\r\nit had five white diffuse circles beneath, one on the tip, two on the long wing and one on the short. they seemed like lights but didn't glow; they brightened the area contrasting on the dark surface but the edges where diffuse.\r\n\r\nthen he went straight on his flight path and i lose sight of him over the opposite wall of the garage. \r\n\r\nthe height of the object seemed low, just above these low strange clouds the whole sighting lasted about 10 or 12 seconds.\r\n\r\ncall my wife several times as i watched but she did

front of me). and when i saw the third light, i also begun to recognize the shape because it was a lil darker then the clouds.Suddenly a big flash scared me and it took off sooooooo fast into the clouds thats why i could see a triangular shape. while it took off, all the streetlights and lights in the buildings and around went off one after another ( is a scarry sound).Everything was dark and i thougt (f*%&ing......Aliens are attacking us...?!!!?) then a car drove down the street, the only light i could see. then i heard my heart pumping again... and very fast.Ididnt want to move cause maybe i was lilbit shocked! after 1-2 minutes all the power and the lights came back. and the feeling of safety crumbles back...\r\nat the next day i asked some friends who went clubbing that evening,

movie. sort of slowly a rumble sort of crept up and kept getting more and more intense. it got to the point where cups, dishes, and nick-knacks were rattling extremely to the point where i picked up a few and tried to find a good place to stand as i thought it was an earthquake. \r\n\r\nmy sister ran up the stairs and we stood in the middle of the living room staring out our massive bay windows as by that time we realized something was moving over the house and it was extremely close! probably less than twenty or so feet above us. it moved slowly past us and we saw it in extreme detail. our home was the highest point in our small town, so we really had the best view of it. i had about 10 minutes from the start of the occurrence to the time i could not see it anymore.\r\n\r\nthe round lights on the bottom of the craft had orange (possibly red) lights along the outer edge of each circular light and a white light in the center of each. occasionally these lights would dim out (sort of pulsating) and you could still see the orange/red lights and they never went off. the craft moved extremely slowly as it went past our home and me and my sister both witnessed it in its entirety. she went downstairs to get a different look at it as it lazily passed (we had sunroofs down there and more bay windows). \r\n\r\nthe craft was incredibly loud, to the point where we were both having to sort of yell at one another from close proximity. the craft was huge, from end to end it had to be over a football field in width and length. i have walked through 747's and other large aircraft before. this dwarfed anything i have ever seen. it had details like box shaped outlines of equipment all over the bottom of the aircraft (although my sister had a better view of that from the sunroof), however it was still clear as day. i could make out a small dome-ish structure on the bottom side of the craft between each circle light and a larger dome where on the underside at the very center of the craft. it was visibly much more dark around the center of the aircraft, around the larger dome. each dome looked like it was made of black glass of some kind.\r\n\r\nit was very sleek and if it had been another 30 to 40 feet higher i wouldn't have been able to make out the domes as they were not very steep in angle. this craft set off multiple car alarms of neighbors up and down the street due to the rumbling and loud noise. i would equate the noise to standing right next to a jet while it was taking off. however,this thing was traveling so slowly it looked like it was just casually floating on by. its speed was ridiculously slow and i had a good long look as it passed us by. there was no exhaust of any kind from the large ship. \r\n\r\nmy cats were so startled from it, they ran upstairs and hid under the bed. it flew in a straight line, slightly ascending (however, it's hard to gauge ascension as something is flying directly away). it remained low as it passed over all the other houses and trees. it finally disappeared over off in the distance and i could still hear it's hum after i lost sight of it. when my dad came home from his outing to the grocery store me and my sister told him what we saw, he said he saw something on his way home, but he didn't feel any rumbling or anything. \r\n\r\ni thought it was strange as there were no emissions coming from it. me and my sister concluded that it was some sort of military ufo and never really talked about it again, but i think we told ourselves that more for peace of mind then anything else. i don't know what it was and so on that account it is a ufo, however, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is still undetermined. but, based upon my familiarity with known planes and aircraft in the years since then, i know there is nothing that big flying around right now. i've walked right under the wings of some of the largest planes and each v-wing of that craft i saw was something on the scale of four to five times bigger than the biggest craft i know of. i honestly to this day just can't account for something like that in the skies. at that slow of a speed i would expect something to just fall right out of the sky.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s), Patterned Surface,
