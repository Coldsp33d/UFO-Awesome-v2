denver, colorado, on the night of friday, january 30th, 2015, at 8:57 pm. firstly, i feel that it is important to note that i served as a helicopter crewman in the navy for six years. i have over 900 flight hours, most of them at sea, where i had to constantly identify lights in the distance, for aerial recon. i was also qualified as an enlisted aviation warfare specialist by my unit. i know what a normal aircraft looks like at night, and how a normal aircraft moves. my friend, who served in the same unit and job with me, also saw the ufo. i did my best to take pictures and video on my iphone 4, but the quality does not do the object justice. there were five of us that saw the craft, at least. i know that one of them also recorded footage, and i am waiting for him to contact me with it. i cannot vouch for the sobriety of anyone but myself that night. but i can vouch for my own. i was sober.\r\n    while attending a concert at the red rocks amphitheater, while the performer was on stage singing, my friend and had our attention caught by something hovering in the sky above us. being former naval helicopter crewman, we instantly knew that it wasn't normal. it appeared as a circle of steady glowing lights. eight in total. six green, and two red. i could not observe whether or not it was solid. but it seemed to be, given the way the lights moved together, as though they were all attached to one craft. the red lights were always located toward the six o'clock position (aft) of the craft whenever it moved in a direction. the craft hovered for several moments, then began moving in patterns, stopping into a hover again at different positions around the event. this was almost as if it was checking out the event. this craft was not a part of the event. it did not cast any light onto the event, nor did it remain in the area for very long. i also feel that it may have been too far back for any decent photography, should that have been a purpose for its presence.\r\n    the craft was able to change direction, speed, and altitude as smoothly as moving a mouse on a computer screen. that is to say that it did not appear to be affected by gravity or wind resistance in any observable way. there was also no observable pitch, roll or yaw when the craft changed directions, as would be the case with any conventional aircraft. it appeared to be about 1000-1500 feet above the ground. although, this would be hard to say for certain. at the range it appeared to be, and given it's size that i would estimate to be comparable to a p-3 orion, there should have been no way that this aircraft could cover so much ground, so quickly as it did, and so smoothly, without any pitch, roll, yaw, or decelerations to turn. \r\n    the object came in and out of sight for several minutes before i observed it vanish for good. i don't know any aircraft capable of what i saw, and neither does my friend. the light formations don't match up with any aircraft i am aware of either. the first ting i thought was, \"maybe it's a drone\". but this could not be the case, in my opinion. i am no drone expert, however, this craft seemed to be much larger, and much faster than any drone that i have observed. i have a friend that flies drones, and after observing my limited footage, my friend agreed, that it seemed to be faster than any drone he knows of.\r\n    i observed a fixed-wing aircraft in the skies immediately following the event. i could not be certain what type it was, or what its purpose was, given how far away it was. i knew that it was a plane because it had a steady green light on one wing, a steady red on the other, and a flashing red light on the nose.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

the horizon line. i waited a few moments to see if it was a typical airplane with lights blinking. it did not. it moved in a diagonal direction of south-east, coming straight at me then slowly moved south. the orb-like object was orange circle inside, but had a fuzzy pink outline. it did not pulse, or have any blinking lights. i watched it for a good 30 seconds as it slowly moved towards me in a diagonally south direction. as it continued to move south it seemed to move higher into the sky. i went inside to grab my cell phone to take a video, it was still traveling higher and somewhat faster

blue skies.My band was set to perform at an star studded private music event for charity.Members from lynyrd skynrd & marshall tucker were the most famous of performers.The event was hosted at the home of the musician who put this whole thing together.Throughout the evening, every band that performed had a electrical problem with their sound & a few times the power completely shut off leaving the sound engineers puzzled.I was so afraid that when it was our time to perform that we too would have the same power problems.We performed around 4:00 p.M. & surprisingly throughout the entire hour we performed,we didn't have any electrical problems.We were so relieved & felt lucky.After getting off stage & mingling with other guest,i decided i would take some photos of my own.It was now around 5:30 p.M. & the sun was closer to setting to the west.We had the \"general lee\" car from the dukes of hazard there & i took a few photos of different guest at the car.Within the next 5 minutes i remember thinking that a photo of the mountain side with the visible moon would be a good photo.The landscape of the property was beautiful.I took my photos with a aiptek brand hd camera with a 6 mega pixel photo resolution.For 2008, this was decent.  \r\n\r\nthe next day,i start to view all the photos i had taken.2 photos struck me to be odd.The first photo was a photo of some guest standing by the general lee car. i noticed in the distance, a solid blue orb in the bushes.You can zoom in & see it better.I'd say it was at least 100 ft away from us hovering there observing.There were no balloons.At that time i google searched blue orb & had only found 1 other & was not satisfied.Now there is more photos showing blue orbs & mostly from ufo reports.The photos before & after the blue orb showed nothing.The third photo after the blue orb,i see a black saucer looking craft right above the trees on the mountain top.You can zoom in & it doesn't look like a bird or hawk.It seems to have an antenna on top of it that is slightly tilted.But it's just not clear enough when zooming in for me to tell.I always hoped that someone with pro photo software could zoom in without distorting it to get a detailed view.\r\n\r\ni've loaded these photos up to share with others & to compare since more folks are getting similar photos.This has intrigued me every since that day.I immediately connected this as to a ufo or paranormal experience.A lot of times people will say that around an ufo or ghostly paranormal event that they'll have electrical problems or an power outage & this came to my mind.I also see the light orbs that others report.Whatever these things are,they are spying on us.I feel no need in being contacted by mufon because the owner doesn't live at the property anymore.What you see in the photos is what you get.Thanks for reading my story.","distance":"21-100

leaving town via the south bridge when i noticed something odd. a pair of cylindrical objects, dark in color and lacking identifying features, flew overhead. these were at high altitude, making determine size and speed difficult. these objects  continued their flight at  roughly heading 060 to 070,  covering an estimated 15 miles in 30 seconds. this is verified by one other eyewitness who claimed they turned nearly above his town. these objects were immediately suspicious, as they distinctly lacked  wings or rotors distinguishable from the ground.  the objects moved with no sound, and promptly altered direction to heading 180 nearly exact, judging by eye. approximately doubling their speed, they exited the airspace and were gone roughly a minute after they turned. the maneuverability i observed was limited, but the single example entirely ruled out fixed wing aircraft, and it's speed ruled out rotor wing units. within the following 3 hours, local air traffic was greatly increased. i personally witnessed a flight of three ch47s in standard army color and configuration, as well as 7 uh-60s or variants, with two sticking out as being a different black than the standard army scheme. these aircraft flew in the same direction as the craft, away from most logical  routine destinations. being between fort riley and mcconnel afb, such flights are not unheard of. however, the strang number of aircraft in a short period is unheard of previously, as was the direction. my friend in a nearby town approached me, believing i would recognize the craft and explain the strange military activity. unable to reach a conclusion, we discreetly (as we both had no intention if being dismissed as crazy) approached a third party whom we knew had been manning a local radar tower in the county airstrip. we came to understand that the objects had a radar signature and registered intermittently. the radar experienced difficult ing in obtaining flight data, and gave signs characteristic of being electronically jammed. however, it is plausible these objects flew at roughly 2,800-3,000 ft agl. the three of us debated pursuing this in a larger city with a larger radar array for it's airport, but promptly decided otherwise. i was not visited, nor was friend a, but the radar operator claimed to have been met by men claiming to be fbi demanding information regarding what his equipment experienced the day after. this visit coincides with the sighting of a single, black helicopter. this helicopter did appear fielded by the army, and in fact resembled a lynx. assuming it was a government sanctioned function, the subject was dropped. that is until it became apparent that animals were missing. cattle had gone missing from 2 owners, who lost 2 head each. i chose to pursue by approaching a fellow serviceman of rank, who responded in a hostile manner and specifically stated that i would be \"...Wisest to remember nothing out of the ordinary.\" fearing backlash or a psyche evaluation, i dropped it indefinitely.\r\n\r\ni find it curious that the black helicopter is specified. if anyone has further information on this helicopter that must be linked to numerous events, please verify my comparison to the british lynx.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1
