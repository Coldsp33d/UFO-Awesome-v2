it was photographed in, and if you look carefully you can see the size of the object correctly pulls at the ambient smoke that was in the air, like it rushed into the photo at just that moment, none

like we saw last night.    while looking at that this star like bright object that looked like a star, it moved, right, center, left, center, up, down in a triangle shape most of the time.  mostly moved left to right and back, then up, down, still in a triangle fashion.  we both observed it long enough to make sure we agreed on what we saw.  i watched it approximately ten minutes, came inside and contacted this website.  as far as i know it is still visible.  we are certain it moved, no blinking lights like an airplane, helicopter, jet, etc. no sound. looked like a star but was definitely moving quickly at times, then slowly in a triangular fashion. i have never seen anything like this before and this is my first, what i believe to be a sighting.  starlike moving quickly as described above.  i am going back outside to see if i observe it again.  my wife came in before me, then i came in about five minutes after and asked her if she had seen what i had and she agreed. it looked exactly like a distant star, bright,no flashing lights,just a constant starlike appearance that moved quickly in the directions that i described before.  i am not under the influence of any medication, alcohol, etc.  i am certain i saw it and my wife was certain she saw it.  it did not scare us and we had no fear.  just sighted this and wanted to report it.  we never lostsight of the object.  thought it was a regular star until it started moving in the directions as i described above.  i know i am repeating myself but want to give the best description i can.  would like to know if anyone else reported this just as i am reporting it.  my wife and i just went back outside to see if it was still there and we both definitely saw the object again.  still starlike but moving somewhat more quickly, no distinct pattern but moved significantly more that before.  my wife thinks she saw a red light flash but i did not observe that.  the time right now is 9:34 pm cst.  will continue to go back outside and observe but its been approximately 30 minutes since we first noticed it and it is in the same place,moving quickly up, then down, right to left as i said before. i cannot seem to describe it any better than i already have. my stepson went outside with my wife and he observed its movement also.  he thinks maybe a satilite but agreed that the starlike object did in fact move.

made a quick joke and my friend insured me that i would see one that night. as he said that another friend which lives about a block away called me to stop by his house and discuss things, pretty much hang out. right as i get there we find ourselves in his backyard talking about ufos, entities, and the universe with his younger brother. as we are discussing his younger brother switches the subject not even a sentence or two in the conversation his brother stops in awe and we spot a orange orb some what switching colors and moving across the sky we look at eachother trying to deny the fact that it is there at the same time we comfired it to be a ufo it stopped almost like they heard us. it sits there for a minute or two and just spirals out to a triangle in other words this one orb let out two other orbs in a perfect spiral to the point that we can see the spiral trail. while the triangle stood there it started ejecting what seemed like fireballs to the ground and absorbing them from the distance we were at we could hear the fireballs flaring it was strange. at this point i pull out my phone and try to record the sighting. i stood there taking a good five to seven pictures and recorded about three to four videos. it stops exhaling and inhaling fireballs and spirals back to one orb, it hovers about for a few seconds does a small z and zaps out of the sky to what i'm assuming is a portal right when it disappeared we heard a small sonic boom and seen the trail it left behind. this is were i think this sighting was being watched by not just us but by the government. right after this happened we realized that we were there for more than seven to eight minutes we run inside to inform everyone who was awake and show them the pictures and videos right as i show my friends brother, sister and his mom the pictures they begin to delete and blackout i was left with two videos that were being played with on my phone in front of my eyes. i felt like sharing this story to people that would actually listen and can relate to this phenomena. i feel that you guys have the right equipment to verify the video i have to be real. if you pause at 1-3 seconds you can see a single orb. at 9-10 seconds you can see the triangle spitting fire and an additional maroon orb which the camera caught.","distance":"Over One

i am not a stranger to planes. i grew up around dozens of stories about them, many discussions with my grandpa about the kinds of jets he flew, and had many a subscription to aviation magazines as a teenager. i was very interested in aviation and wanted to be a pilot.\r\n\r\nbecause of this, i've tried my best to be as specific in this reporting as possible.\r\n\r\nwith most aircraft, there are aircraft navigation, or position lights. as well as anti-collision strobe lights. the closest thing i could say to how the lights alternated would be the rotating beacon, located on the fuselage and the tail of a regular aircraft. however, the positions of the lights were not like a planes, and while most conventional aircraft have several different colored lights; including red, green, and white, this had similar to a rainbow pattern.. up to 8 or 9 different colors. as low as it was, with a regular aircraft, it'd make sense for the landing light to be on, or the taxi light.. but i live many miles from any strips or landing zones. because of the shape, how low it was flying, the alternation of the lights and the displacement of the colors in relation to regular craft, the complete lack of noise, the deviation of regular flight paths and unique movements... i'm reasonably inclined to believe that this in fact was a ufo.\r\n\r\nit shape was not that of a banner tow or glider tow aircraft.. or f-15, f-22, f-35 class, or a-10 class.. or any reasonably shaped aircraft..","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":62967,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.3568157,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01302015-0003","longitude":-77.4416505,"occurred":1422538020000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1422619025000,"summary":"Unlike anything i have ever seen.
