allowed to smoke cigarettes in the house, but i used to stick my head out of the window and smoke cigarettes. i had to pick my wife up from the airport and her flight was arriving at about 11:55pm. i have never told anyone about this, but i can pinpoint the exact date and approximate time because i can view my wife's itinerary by a simple search of my email history. i was sneaking a cigarette because i was stressed about her arrival and i wanted a smoke before i had to wake out daughter up and drive into boston (this is only a 15 minute drive at this late hour). i was awake and alert and what i saw was so clear and realistic, that it was incredibly off putting. it was unreal. i was seeing it, but i simultaneously could not believe what i was seeing. now, i've always believed that ufos are real, but i couldn't believe what i was seeing. \r\n\r\nanother reason it seemed \"unreal\" was that this object was not what i would have ever expected to see whenever i would imagine seeing a ufo. the best way i could describe it is a flying disk that i might see in a 1950s science fiction movie. it was a green flying saucer, larger on the bottom than it was on top, with three circles on the topmost section, not windows, but in a child's drawing what would be windows. it was completely silent and made no movements. \r\n\r\nmy first thought was that this was a child's remote control aircraft, like a little toy ufo with a hidden propeller. after all, there is a park and playground in the elementary school park across the street (clarke elementary). however, in the view, looking out my window and to the right, has two trees, less than 20 feet apart from one another, with the nearest tree probably 50 feet from my house. this object passed behind both of these trees, and this is when i was able to gain some reference as to the size of this object, based my distance from these trees and the size of the object as it passed behind these trees. \r\n\r\ni wanted to grab my crappy cell phone and take a photo, but i was afraid that by the time i grabbed my phone that this object would have passed behind the houses and would be out of site for good. i decided instead to continue watching it until it was out of sight, as it moved south behind the houses on my block (for reference, i was looking west up norfolk ave and the object was moving perpendicular to me, heading south or southwest). \r\n\r\nmy wife and i were not on good terms at the time and i felt as though i would sound crazy if i told her about it. further, at the time we were planning on getting divorced. i didn't want her using this sighting against me. full disclosure, i smoke pot and i drink regularly (not getting drunk, but 2-4 drinks in a night is not unusual for me). while i might have had a drink or two that night (i cannot recall), i most likely had smoked pot that night. that said, in 25 years of smoking marijuana, i have never hallucinated before or after this sighting.\r\n\r\nwhen i hear about sightings on tv or in books, it never occurred to me who these people call when they have seen something. i knew i saw something, and i thought about reporting the sighting, but i had no idea who to call. i did not know about mufon. i am 100% confident about what i saw. i have no doubt. i think about this evening very often. my hopes in reporting this event is that you will look at the date and time of this sighting and be able to match it with someone else's report on the same date and around the same time. the only thing that i can imagine as a rational explanation of what i saw is if there was a company flying a cheesy ufo blimp in my neighborhood, which i doubt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

a sunny and clear summer morning with my father's 22 rifle to do some target shooting, heading to the barn.  above, from the north east, moving slowly and leisurely across the sky, turning end over end, i suppose one could call it tumbling, was a cylindrical object aprroximately 2000 feet in the air. it looked like a gigantic, shiny chrome tin can, and as it slowly tumbled, i could see the flat bottom and top were identical and seemed to have metallic scratches or brushed chrome designs shaped in circles while the sides were clear reflective chrome. there was no sound, no lights, no windows, it was solid metal.  to clarify what i was seeing, there i was about to go target shooting, my first split-second thought was that someone had thrown up a tin can into the sky for me to shoot at.  i quickly realized that was no tin can and i understood it would be ludicrous of me to shoot at it.  i just stood and watched 2 minutes as it crossed the farm fields, i could see it's shadow in the field as it passed and i watched it slowly disappear into the horizon miles away.  years wemt by, i raised a family, ran a business and never really thought about that event until i happened to take a book from the library called \"ufo report\" or something like that and flipping though it, i saw some drawings which looked certainly very similar, perhaps even identical, to the bottoms of that \"tin can\".  reading up on it, the article talked about crop circles and things i've never heard of but i wondered if the ends of that object, were electromechanically pulling, one end pulling the other on an on-off sequence, causing it to slowly tumble in the end-over-end manner i described.  pardon my ignorance on these matters.  of course i remember it to this day and as improbable as it sounds, i've even tried some rudimentary experiments to see if i could recreate such a thing in my basement utilizing electical magnets and a beam of light.  i'm including an admittedly amateurish

approximately 7 pm.  i was at the massai point parking lot on the mountain in my car looking at the awesome stars when i noticed a flashing light moving in a line near the horizon miles away.  it moved behind a tree and never reappeared, which made me wonder where it went.  i thought that perhaps it was a plane.  so i got out of the car and looked where i last saw the object and saw 3 flashing lights hovering and moving around near the horizon.  they didn't appear to have a pattern in their movements, but every few minutes 2 of them would line up in the sky, and the third would appear and move so the 3 objects would form a triangle.  then the 'triangle' would move, as if it was a single object. it seemed to drift slowly. after 5 or 10 seconds, the lights would break apart from the triangle and begin moving around again.  for the most part they were blinking, but sometimes they just glowed.  they didn't display color, just white light.\r\n    i watched this display for about 30 minutes and the objects formed the triangle at least 5 or 6 times.  they usually blinked, and at times appeared to be miles apart from each other.  other times they would zoom near each other and hang in the air.  they were near the horizon and appeared to be lower in altitude than where i was (about 6500 ft. above sea level.) sometimes they would zoom upward, other times they would just appear to float around slowly.  again, they didn't appear to have any pattern in their movements, apart from occasionally forming the triangle.\r\n    it was very windy and cold out on the mountain, and the dark was spooking me out, and i thought i heard a large animal messing around with a trash can (probably a bear) so i stayed in my car most of the time.  i did not have my camera with me, so i don't have any evidence apart from my sighting.  i'm not even sure it was possible to record the objects from that distance, anyway...\r\n    fyi, the national monument i was at is approximately 40 miles or so from mexico, and near the new mexico border.  these objects had to have been at least 10-20 miles away from me.  that's just a guess, as it was pitch black out there and i had nothing to base the distance on.\r\n     at first i was just amazed at what i was witnessing, whether it was helicopters, drones, kites, whatever.  their movements were fluid and they just seemed to move around like they were having fun.  then i realized that there was just nothing in that direction but mountains, desert and ranch land. i got a little scared being alone up there, but that feeling passed after about 10 minutes of the display.  i even flashed my lights in groups of 3 a few times just to see what would happen.  nothing did.  i watched these lights for about 30 minutes or so, and then returned to the campsite at the base of the mountain.  i was tired, a little spooked and confused at what i was watching and had had enough.  \r\n     one last thing:  i have been watching the skies since a child and had a fascination with ufo's when i was younger, but stopped reading about them in my adult years.  i figured most sightings were military in nature, or some secret technology the government was testing.  i'm not so sure anymore.  i haven't seen any other reports of sightings that day in s. arizona, so maybe i was the only one who witnessed them.  who knows.  and again, that area they seemed to be near appears to be nothing but open range.  i don't think there is any military area near there.  white sands was over a hundred miles to the east of me, and i am certain these objects were nowhere near that area.\r\n\r\nthanks for listening.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":62919,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.2528519,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01272015-0018","longitude":-109.8320124,"occurred":1421895600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1422412192000,"summary":"Saw

#62914.\r\n\r\non sunday october 12th, 2014, a little after 8pm est, my husband had gone outside to turn off the lights in our detached garage. he immediately shouted back to me to come outside and bring the camera – his tone was urgent. \r\n\r\ni fumbled for a moment getting the camera, and when i stepped out our back door i was aghast! the sky to the north of our home was lit up like a christmas tree with a large cluster of red pulsating lights that were flying in formation from east to west. i set the camera to video and started filming. i was standing on the top step and my husband was below me, and to my left, at ground level. he told me to step down for a better viewpoint. i had difficulty doing so because i couldn't see the stairs in the dark. he helped me down, and i filmed all the while. the video jiggles around during that time.\r\n\r\nthe sight of these lights was startling. the lights pulsed from a dim glowing orange red to a strong, deep red.  while they moved in one large formation, each light was variable enough in its speed and pulsing that they appeared to be individual crafts, as opposed to many lights on one large craft. i estimate there were between 25 and 50 crafts. they moved in unison, but did not pulse in unison. the visual effect was scintillating, like christmas tree lights that fade in and out rapidly and randomly. they moved slower than the average airplane, and they made no noise. \r\n\r\nmy husband ran inside to grab the phone during the sighting. he intended to call our next door neighbor so there would be another witness. as he did so, the lights began to fade out and disappear. i called to him that they were disappearing! he abandoned the phone and returned outside to catch the last of the crafts. \r\n\r\nthere were some stragglers that followed after the large formation was gone. these later craft were slightly different from the others; they flew more in a single file line than in a cluster, they seemed to be larger lights than the others and the color was more orange. while their color also pulsed, it seemed slower and stronger than the formation lights. i tried zooming in on one of these craft. \r\n\r\nmy sd card ran out of space during filming and i had to run inside and change to a new card. i resumed filming on the new card. i also tried to zoom in and take some still photos, but the shutter speed was too long for a hand held shot. (i got photos of smeared lights). at some point during the sighting, i checked my watch and the time was 8:10pm.\r\n\r\nupon reviewing the videos, the red craft are not as visible in the film as they were to the naked eye. the brighter ones appear in the video, but the camera didn’t capture them all; the sky was shimmering with them! also, reviewing the video i noticed some larger, more orangeish craft on the upper right side. these look like those other craft that came afterwards – but they appear to be flanking the mass of red sparklers.  i didn’t realize this until watching the video.\r\n\r\nin my video, you can hear the traffic from i-495, which is nearby. there is no sound to the crafts that i could discern live, or in my video. i could not discern a shape to the crafts with my naked eye. to my view, i could only see them as lights.\r\n\r\nthe weather conditions at the time of the event were chilly with a partly cloudy sky. the patchy clouds were semi-transparent, low, feathery type. the clear parts of the sky were clear enough to see stars. i estimate the temperature was about 55-60 degrees. noaa wind maps indicate winds from the south at 3000’ and from the west at 6000’ this evening. \r\ni called our local police station to ask if anyone had reported some unusual lights, and the trooper replied that they did have a man come in around 10pm to report some unusual lights in the sky. i also called the philadelphia airport to learn if they had any explanation for strange lights this evening, such as an air show, or other events involving flying objects, etc. they said they would normally be informed of these kinds of events, but they have no such events on their calendar for this evening.\r\n\r\nmy background: i’m 49 years old and have worked in banking most of my working life. i enjoy the night sky, sometimes with a telescope, but usually with the naked eye. while i have little knowledge of airplanes, i have lived under the landing pattern of the philadelphia airport all of my life. i see planes in the night sky all the time – i’ve never seen anything like these lights. \r\n\r\nmy feeling when seeing these objects was astonishment, but i was also fearful because of the sheer numbers  – and you can hear the trepidation in my voice in the video. the sighting was so dramatic, and yet short and limited to a small area of sky. i can easily see how this could be happening all the time, yet never be noticed by housebound people, or people who never look up.  it struck me interesting that the weather was in flux from clear to cloudy when these craft appeared. by the time the last craft departed, the sky had become mostly cloudy. it was a small window of viewing opportunity that lined up perfectly for us to see them. \r\n\r\ni added a photo i took on 10/12/14 a little more than an hour after the event. i took this photo using a flash to show the viewing area the videos were taken in, so one might better see the piece of sky we were viewing, which is rather dark and ambiguous in the video. here one can see the holly tree on the right which obscured the area where the formation, and subsequent stragglers, came from. i also did a quick sketch today, to show the diamond-like formation i saw that night, which doesn’t really come across in the video. \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

off lights in our detached garage. heading back inside, from our back porch, through a clear, unobstructed opening between trees that faces north northeast i saw a tight cluster of approximately 50 or more (difficult to count) blinking orange to reddish lights. they were in a loose cluster formation traveling east to west, much slower than an airplane and without any sound. the majority of formation was of such a size that i could cover them with both hands spread at arms length. the sky was clear to the north with high, thin clouds coming in from the south. the lights were below the clouds but appeared very high. there were also lights from a plane traveling north, above the clouds and above the cluster, but from my viewpoint ‘through’ the cluster. the wind was light and the direction the lights were moving seemed to contradict the wind and the cloud movement. i know winds can vary with altitude, and i do not know how high these lights were flying. having seen a fireball recently, i stopped to consider what i was seeing and realized it was not fireball, fireworks or anything else that i’d ever seen before. i watched them for several seconds, thinking they would quickly vanish, and when they didn’t, i called my wife and asked her to bring the camera. there is over 5 minutes of video that document most of what we saw.\r\n\r\nwhat they looked like to me were electrically generated lights, not flame, pulsing from a very bright orange to a not so bright red and back again. no way was it flame! they pulsed at about 1 second intervals, not in unison. the lights were moving at about the same speed and direction with some slight variation. there seemed to be two types – one type was definitely brighter than the other type.\r\n\r\ni went inside to get the phone to call our neighbor but stopped, grabbed my binoculars instead and returned when my wife said the lights were disappearing. the way they were disappearing was just to kind of fade out. no loss in altitude. each one just fizzling out where it stood, bunches at a time, when they reached a particular area, until the only ones that were left were a handful of the brighter ones. as those last ones diminished, a few more of the brighter type drifted into view from the east. the position of our house and a large holly tree prevented us from seeing where they originated, they just drifted into our small field of view and every single one of them vanished within our sight after crossing our small field of view.  a couple at a time, then one at a time, with longer spaces in between, and then they were done. the last one seemed to change direction after crossing the opening in the sky. it seemed to move rapidly further away to the north before vanishing. \r\n\r\nwhen i tried looking at them with my binoculars and it appeared that the orange light was coming from the bottom of the object and the red light was coming from the top. it also appeared that they went a little faster when the red light was glowing, and slower when the orange light was glowing, though that could have been an illusion. i’d like to think this could be explained as being chinese lanterns or something of the sort, but the intensity of the electric light, their height, the fact that they remained in  such a tight formation, and that they vanished so simultaneously, make it difficult to explain. \r\n\r\ni’ve lived my entire 50+ years under the flight path of philadelphia international airport. i’ve worked outdoors all my life. i intentionally spend a lot of my leisure time looking at the sky, day and night, and enjoying the variety of light displays, natural and manmade.  this is a very urban area and it’s not uncommon to see distant fireworks or balloons from a party. what i saw on this date was something i’ve never seen before – and i’m just amazed. my feelings afterwards are amazement, curiosity and a sensation that i will see them again.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

governments.\r\n\r\n     in 1982, i was in the united states air force serving as a crew chief on c-130 cargo planes out of little rock air force base. after a routine mission carrying cargo to a base in california we were enroute back to arkansas. the day was beautiful and wonderful for flying. the cockpit of a c-130 is large and very roomy. it has so many windows in it, the crews referred to it as the\"greenhouse\". this was where i would spend most of my time in flight. there is plenty of room to stand behind either the pilot or co-pilot and just look out the windows. i never seemed to get tired of watching the world go by from this perspective. the view was pretty much unobstructed as there are windows at floor level, chest level and at head level. there was patchy cloud cover below us which started at 13,500 and built up to about 18,000 feet. we were flying at 22,000 feet where \r\nthe sky was clear. we were over flying a large patch of clouds. we were coming upon a large open area that extended for about 60 miles along our flight path before becoming cloud covered again. as we overflew the edge of the cloud cover i spotted a group of aircraft below us clearly visible against the dark background of a heavily forested region. i noticed immediately that there were five aircraft flying in a loose formation, one behind the other, with the fifth aircraft trailing the other four by a larger margin. \r\ni tapped the pilot on the shoulder and indicated i wanted to speak with him off headset. \"sir\" i said. \"we have traffic at our 9 o'clock, low.\" the pilot gave me a puzzled look since this was information that usually went out over headset and was heard by the entire crew. i\r\npointed down at the aircraft and waited for the pilot to spot them. he did pretty quickly and from the way he shifted his position for a better look, i was pretty sure he was seeing what i was. \"sir, do you \r\nsee any wings or empennage on those aircraft?\" i asked. the look that he gave me pretty much told me the answer to that one. \"chief, how long have you been observing them?\" he asked. \"sir, they appeared from under the cloud cover as we passed over the edge.\" i answered. \"they appear to\r\nbe traveling at our speed and holding a steady altitude.\" i added. by this time the rest of the cockpit crew had noticed our \"private\" conversation and the fact that we were obviously looking at something. \"whats going on over there?\" the co-pilot asked. the pilot looked at him, started to say\r\nsomething, thought better and went back to observing our \"companions.\" it was only a couple of seconds later that the engineer was leaning over my shoulder to have a look at whatever it was that had the pilot's and mine's attention. when he got a look, i gave up my position so that he could get a \r\nreal good look. off came his headset and he said  \"what in the hell are those?\" the co-pilot could not see from his position and couldn't leave his seat so he just kept asking, \"what do you see? what's going \r\non?\" i felt sorry for him because nobody was answering him. the navigator came and took a look,after a few seconds of observing the aircraft he just looked at the pilot, then at me and then the engineer. he went back to his station, sat down and never asked a single question. below us at\r\nabout 16,000 feet were five circular aircraft. they were white in color with what appeared to be either seams or  dark painted thin lines radiating from their center to their outer edges. this divided up the skin of the aircraft much the way a pie is cut up in a pan. since they were only about 6,000\r\nfeet away, we had a very clear view. compared to our c-130 we estimated their diameter to be between 80 and 130 feet. their flight path was parallel to ours and seemed to be holding steady in their speed, matching theirs with ours. whither this was deliberate on incidental is unknown.\r\nwe continued to observe them for about 5 minutes, more or less. while their course and spacing remained steady, they seemed to \"bob\" up and down slightly. things had gotten pretty quiet in the cockpit along this time. no one wanted to believe what we were seeing. there was no denying the\r\nfact that it was a clear and unobstructed view of what we all knew to be something unknown to us.Soon we came to the edge of the opening in the clouds. the craft continued to keep pace with us and \r\nas they overflew the edge of the cloud cover they were clearly visible against the backdrop of the slightly darker cloud. we were able to observe them only for a few more seconds before they penetrated the cloud\r\nand were lost to view. everyone sat back for a moment and soaked up the last few minutes.The first to speak was the pilot. \"how many of you want to be grounded from flying?\" he asked. he got silence from everyone. \"fine then. i don't know what those were. for all i know they were ours.\"he said. none of us ever mentioned it to anyone that i am aware of. i have waited over 30 \r\nyears to find out if they were indeed, ours. guess i'll keep waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.S. i wrote this for a english comp class. it is truthful and as accurate as i can remember. i think the base we went to on this mission was norton in california. i do not know exactly where we were or the course we were running. it's pretty much a straight shot from little rock afb to norton but as the crew chief, routes were not my job.I do not recall our airspeed  but we usually cruised at around  310-328 knots. we experienced nothing out of the ordinary either to us or the aircraft we were in. we just saw them and observed them. they were as clear to us as it could be. what prompted me to report this, i was watching one of the ufo programs on tv and the theme seemed to be about a particular parallel line running across the middle of the usa. while i cannot confirm that was the route we were on, it made sense that the route we should have been on would have been in that approximate line of travel. i for one was glad to have seen a unknown during clear conditions during daylight. this allowed me to see the objects clearly. i don't know if a 30 year old report is of any use but here it is.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

2015. i was working doing my rural paper route in silerton tn.  as i stopped at a stop sign i heard what sounded like a helicopter.  this is not unusual. as things get pretty boring on my route i tend to notice things out of the ordinary.  i sat for a about two mins awaiting the helicopter as the sounds grew closer.  i couldn't find them in the sky so i continued on my route.  about 4 miles i traveled when i caught sight of the helicopter over the tree line.  i sped up around the corner to see if maybe an accident had happened i initially thought this was a medical helicopter.  as i rounded the corner.  i could see three obvious military helicopters.  i am not an expert on aircraft nor have i served in the military. we have a national guard armory in town so i am well versed in the site of military craft. i figured that's all it was.  so i continued working.  at approximately 6:15 a.M. i came to a wide open 3 mile straight away on my route.  i always look at the stars at this point on my route.  as i looked to the north i noticed something completely unusual two stars in the sky brighter than venus.  and they appeared to be traveling closer together as they were on opposite sides of the road.  initially i thought it could be a brain matrix as sometimes when you travel stationary objects appear to move,  and there were two slight curves in the road.  as i got to the straight away i tried to pay better attention to the lights to figure out why they were so bright.  my first thought was perhaps they were landing lights of planes.  instantly i knew this was not the case as i see dozens of these every night.  my focus went back to determining if they were stationary object or not.  they appeared to still be traveling as both object were now in my windshield and i was traveling straight.  i came to a complete stop to rule out anything i may be doing to cause these objects to appear to be moving.  they continued to head towards one another until they crossed paths.  completely confused on what i was seeing i decided to something and i have no idea why i did this.  i use very bright hid lights colored pink.  as this is a very open area and very secluded with little to no population i figured if i could see them perhaps they can see me. i flashed my lights in a distinct order two times fast and a pause for about half a second then flashed a second time.  feeling goofy about it in my own mind.  i shifted to drive and was about to continue forward.  when on a dime both object stopped without slowing down. \r\n as soon as this happened my heart sank and my face become numb and flush with panic.  i froze in place and could not think fast enough what to do next.  the object on the right blinked then the object on the left blinked then together they blinked about half a second later.  in the exact sequence i flashed my lights in.  i immediately sped to the next drive way.  i felt as if i needed to hide.  i pulled into a driveway and parked where the trees blocked my view of the object that was on the right.  i sat for a few seconds and grabbed my phone i wanted to text my wife and just tell her what was going on i looked at my phone and watched the battery go from 92% to 0 and shut off. i was listening to the radio station 107.7 the bob and sheri show was on.  and the station completely went out.  i hit the scan button on my radio and could not pick up a single station.  the static in the station began to pulsate in the same sequence i flashed my lights.  a minute or two had past at this point and my only thought was to drive home i didn't even finish my route i didn't want to continue north bound and see the objects.  as i looked out of my window the object was now hovering just above the trees where i could see it.  this felt intentional to me.  i sped off southbound trying to get home.  i could not see the objects in my rear view mirror.  and felt relieved.  i was now on a road surrounded by trees on all sides.  i noticed at this point it was a very cloudy sky usually the sun would be coming out at this point no stars in the sky.  i could now see through the trees as i was driving one object was  following me southbound.  as i came to another clearing i noticed the object seemed further away but was not traveling away from me but in the same direction i then noticed that the objects were actually stacked on top of each other.  and we're flashing what i can only describe as a beam.  it appeared to look like when you shine a flashlight in the sky at night when some fog is present.  the beam didn't come all the way down to the ground it appeared to only travel a short distance from the objects.  they were shinning this light in all directions.  i tried to slow down as i slowed the objects slowed.  i turned east onto montezuma rd.  the objects for a moment were behind me i turned off to hwy 100 e heading toward henderson tn.  and the object were now on my right hand side as if they just appeared there.  i was becoming more and more scared at this point and decided to take a back road so that i was at least in  a more populated area surround by more tree cover. as i turned north bound wilson school rd.  after about a mile i entered into tree cover i noticed a school bus in front me and felt safer for some reason.  as i looked to the sky i could not see the objects any more.  i continued on this road for another two miles and turned east on sanford rd.  as i looked out my window i could see the object again through the trees.  still had no radio stations.  i was at almost the exact spot i saw the helicopters earlier and as soon as i noticed where i was at two helicopters flying about 150 feet above the tree lines headed in the direction of the craft.  the radio made the static sound again in the same sequence and it popped back on.  i could no longer see the craft.  i reached down for my phone and pressed the power button and it booted up.  battery was 92% but my clock was in eastern time zone.  after about a min changed back to central time.  this was without a doubt the most bizarre thing to ever happen to me.  i don't feel comfortable even discussing this with my wife.  i'm actually terrified to go back to work tomorrow.

thus, the approximate year being 1971. it was a clear, warm summer evening and many of us kids on phillips drive--located on the west side of indianapolis--were outside playing. we lived very close to what was then called weir cook airport (now indianapolis international), so it was common to hear jet plans rattle the windows of our houses every 5-10 minutes as they approached the landing strip. this was a rare evening when no jets came in to land for a period of 15-20 minutes.\r\n\r\nat some point, as i was playing in the front yard, i noticed something shiny high in the sky, directly overhead. the sun was starting to set, and was reflecting off whatever the object was. more and more children began to notice it, and some of their parents (including my dad) came outside to see the object.\r\n\r\nthe object began to look larger and larger, and we noticed it was because it was descending. after about five minutes, it had descended to a spot that seemed close overhead (i would compare it to the size of a quarter or half-dollar coin if i were to hold it skyward, arm extended). at this point, it simply stopped, apparently hovering--although there was no sound coming from the object. \r\n\r\nby this time, probably 20 neighbors had gathered in their yards, looking upward at the object. i don't know if anyone took a picture (i don't think we even owned a camera at the time). it was very easy for me to see, as it was directly overhead. it was a silver saucer with rounded edges; it appeared to be solid and smooth with no markings.\r\n\r\nafter hovering there for several minutes, i clearly saw a line of black dots (almost like data, although i wouldn't have called it data at the time) release from one side of the object. i counted six of these black dots, in a perfect line, each one exactly the same distance from the next. \r\n\r\nthe dots were not big, and i am sure most of the people watching did not even see them, as they were discharged quickly and seemingly in precise order. almost instantly, they were no longer visible, at least to me.\r\n\r\nafter the dots were discharged or released from the object, it then began a slow ascent, eventually ascending high enough that it was no longer visible to the naked eye. \r\n\r\nit appeared to me that the object has ascended and descended at the same speed...Very slowly, very deliberately. and i am guessing that it \"hovered\" stationary for about five minutes. at some point i recall my dad looking at the saucer through binoculars; i also recall being very excited, and running down to my friend's house (two doors down) shouting \"it's a saucer!\"\r\n\r\nafter the event, i recall my dad calling weir cook airport (now indianapolis international), asking if anyone knew what the object was. the report was \"it must have been a weather balloon.\" but in the years that have followed, i have seen multiple pictures of weather balloons...And this was no weather balloon. \r\n\r\nmy memory in the hours/days that followed is vague. i seem to recall watching the tv news (perhaps the next day), but don't believe there was anything reported about it. i do remember that mike ahern was the broadcast journalist of the channel we watched (we only had four channels back in those days!). i don't remember anyone talking about it, either, perhaps because (being children), we were too busy playing.\r\n\r\ni wish i'd asked my dad about this when i was older, but he died when i was barely 19...Now i am 53. my mom has no recollection of it; however, i don't recall her coming outside (she was probably cleaning up from supper). dad and i were the only ones outside from my family; i believe my two older sisters were at marching band practice.\r\n\r\ni don't know why i am just now telling this story. it's just something i felt i should tell someone, because it was a very real event, the likes of which i have not since experienced. i did find one of my childhood friends on facebook, but she did not recall the event (perhaps she was not home at the time). i know of a couple more of the old neighbor kids that i can contact on facebook, and will ask them if they remember it. \r\n\r\ni do recall with great specificity the street, the address, how the grass felt beneath my bare feet, and the unique mixture of cool warmth on my skin that summer evening. and i...Wonder if anyone else has reported a similar story to you...Any one of the people who stood outside and watched this rare event that night on phillips drive. \r\n\r\nthanks for the opportunity to share. note: i do not know if we were on central or eastern time in indianapolis back in those days.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":62903,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.74819616358969,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01272015-0002","longitude":-86.22633737832412,"occurred":49860900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1422361126000,"summary":"Summer's eve view of ufo by neighborhood.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"46241","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":15885,"locationName":"Indianapolis, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:63524"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Ontario","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While slowly paddling my canoe around 4am in killarney provincial park, ontario, to get a head start climbing a mountain on the other side of the lake. incidentally, killarney has some of the most spectacular (white) rock formations of any provincial park in canada. i spotted this moon-starlike orb over clearsilver lake. the sky was pitch black except for a few distant stars. this singular orb was eerie; too big to be a moon, absolutely so silent it couldn't be an aircraft, and lacking the twinkle of a star. at first i was concerned the orb might be heading straight towards me, but became aware it was in a fixed position in the sky and never changed its size. i was mesmerized by it. the orb disappeared without a sound as soon as i lifted my head up from looking at the lake surface to check for a major reflection- there was none. the lake remained calm, unperturbed and mirrored the small distant stars. my fellow canoeists were all oblivious to what i had witnessed and the evidence was gone by the time i asked them if they had also seen this unusual light source.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":62902,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0700443,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01272015-0001","longitude":-117.6430976,"occurred":939900600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1422353228000,"summary":"Orb over camp lake","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5583,"locationName":"Ontario, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:63525"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Puslinch","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Family was stargazing at beverly swamp near the corner of concession road 8 and westover road, near millgrove and puslinch, ontario.  family was star gazing, saw a star, thought it was a pulsar.  over 2-3 minutes the pulsating became brighter and more frequent, until it became really bright and stopped.  at its place was a bright white, intense, round object, the glow from the pulsating closed off behind it.  this was facing north west at about 75-80 degrees from horizon.  white light started heading down to earth and south-southwest direction.  while it was moving it \"powered off\" and slowly floated down and away, was black, but visible (visible black circle was observable due to the orange haze of lights from nearby cambridge, ontario), then disappeared.  kind of cool to see it, thought it was a pulsar but became an object.  was with my wife, and our two teen kids, all 4 of us seen it.  lost sight as it went away toward the blackness between cambridge and brantford.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":62901,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.377784429882894,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01262015-0019","longitude":-80.0862106001064,"occurred":1414306800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1422344860000,"summary":"Pulsating star, increased in frequency and brightness until a white sphere emerged, then turned black ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"N0B2J0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":93,"locationName":"Puslinch, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:63526"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":877}
