sure which year it was, mid 1996 to fall 1999. i departed my domicile approx. 21:30 hrs, to report to work. i stepped out on the uncovered porch, i turned to grasp the door knob, to pull it closed and secure it. \r\n\r\nwhen i did, i happened to see a movement of an object in the air, behind the four 50-60 feet tall elm trees, growing in the corner of the yard. \r\nthe upper limbs of the trees, was between me and the this aircraft of unknown origin as observed from my front porch, as it was traveling in the air.\r\n\r\ni glanced to the east-north-east and upward at about 45 degrees, and watched it continue on suspected path toward a point between bonner springs ks. and edwardsville ks. \r\n\r\nthe craft i saw was a large black rectangle shape, \"shoe box\" approximately 800'x 400'x 200' best guess of size, quietly, and w/o any detected atmospheric disturbance, nor motor noise, of any type. \r\n\r\nthere was large yellow-orange lens, similar to turn signal color, maybe 20' diameter, perhaps every 50' along the length of the craft. there was smaller maybe 10' diameter, frosted or semi-clear lens, white light along the upper edge of the craft. \r\n\r\ni was so taken aback i stood there watching it move through the air. i never in my lifetime would i ever see a u.F.O. after about 10 seconds, i thought \"need a photo\" i hurriedly went back into the house to get my camera. this took about 20 seconds. i was unable to find it. i went back out on the porch, and the object was gone. \r\n\r\nit had progressed past the horizon toward the east-north-easterly from a

morning of sat. november 29, 2014, i went up to the 2nd floor guest room where i was staying to go to bed.  the room has a big window that looks out over their backyard.  there are houses to each side of them but only a wooded area behind them.  there are no houses, streets or other roads behind them.  my window was open but the curtains were drawn.  just seconds after i had laid down on the bed, i saw two bright flashes of blue light thru my window in short succession.  they were like pulses of light; they were very intense and focused.  they did not cause the entire window curtain nor the dark room around me to illuminate only the areas where they flashed thru the curtain.   i had never seen anything like it.  i immediately thought ‘what the heck is that’, but for whatever reason i didn’t get up to go to the window.  then after a short pause, though the curtains i began to see bursts of white lights that appeared to be exploding like fireworks in or behind the backyard (although there was no sound whatsoever).  this continued for what seemed like around 30 seconds to one minute, so i finally got up to investigate.  by this time the bursts were dying down, but when i pulled back the curtain i seemed to see a single round object illuminated with white light – the lighted object was fading and by the time i got my glasses on to get a better look, it was gone.  i waited for a while to see if there would be any other lights, but i saw none.  no further lights appeared during the rest of my visit either.  \r\n\r\ni didn’t think much about the strange lights in my bedroom for the next couple of days, but then i began to feel a very strange sensation in my right knee.  it wasn’t pain, it was more like a sensitivity if anything.  the tissue underneath the skin felt strangely as if it had been sliced, but i saw no breaks of skin, abrasions or bruises.   i know it sounds crazy, but for some reason, at that point i started thinking about the weird lights in my room and wondering if there was any connection.  then, when i went thru security at the airport on the way back home to california, the tsa body scanned revealed some anomaly on my right kneecap.  the tsa patted the area down, found nothing and let me continue on my way.  the odd sensitivity of my skin around my kneecap continued for some weeks even after i got home.  \r\n\r\nafter seeing the objects on 12/22/14 as described in my other report #62878, i also can’t help but wonder if there some connection between what happened to me in texas and what i videoed on 12/22/14.   it’s a little unsettling but mostly i would just like to find out what it was.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet,

approx. 12:40p\r\ni had met some friends for lunch at a restaurant in the alviso area of san jose, ca on monday, december 22, 2014.  i was returning to work and i exited eastbound hwy. 237 at mccarthy blvd. in milpitas.  as i approached the traffic signal at the intersection of the frontage road at mccarthy blvd., looking eastward toward the mountains i noticed what appeared to be 5-6 metallic spheres hovering above the foothills, swaying slightly back and forth over the cityscape.  they appeared to be moving in unison, not breaking their formation.  puzzled and surprised, i pulled out my iphone and began videoing what i thought were the spheres.  after a few seconds, i zoomed my phone in to get what i hoped would be a better shot.   i was only able to remain stopped at the intersection for a few moments, then the light changed to green and traffic began moving, so i stopped recording and drove back to the office.\r\n\r\neager to view what i thought i had just videoed, i pulled into a parking space at my office and replayed the video.  i was initially greatly disappointed as the video didn’t show any signs of the spheres.  maybe i was filming in the wrong area – i had hurriedly pulled out my phone and was only able to be at the intersection for a few moments.  for some reason, the video also initially played for the entire length in slow motion.  i watched it a couple of times and was about to give up hope, thinking maybe what i saw hadn’t actually been there, when i noticed a moving object in the video - just not one i had seen as i was filming.  the black object starts off diagonally above the traffic signal and to the left, moves down below the level of the signal, then moves up and to the right just above the signal, shoots diagonally to just the top of the street light nearest to the traffic signal, then back down about mid-way between the streetlight and traffic signal.  \r\n\r\nthe object then begins a straight ascent upward toward the top of the cloud bank, disappearing through the clouds momentarily, then re-appearing about 2/3 of the way to top of the clouds on the right hand side of the picture.  it stops there briefly and then makes a rapid diagonal leftward descent, partially through the clouds, back to near its original position in the video.  it then makes another rapid diagonal rightward ascent back up into the clouds, appearing again near the top of the cloud bank, only to make another fast diagonal descent back through the clouds.  unfortunately, this is the point where i zoom the video in to the metallic spheres i was seeing.    the object is briefly seen in larger detail before the zoom takes it out of the picture altogether – it does not appear again during the rest of the slow motion video.\r\n\r\nthis object wasn’t the reason i had made the video, and didn’t see it at all when i initially filmed.  at first  i thought the object might have been a bird.  it was only later, when the video starting playing at its normal speed did i realize how fast this occurred.  i don’t think it could be a bird with the speed of the object;
