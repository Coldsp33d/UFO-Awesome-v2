 at this point, being very curious, i went back out my front door and my eyes were immediately drawn to a very small light that appeared to be a star and seemingly \"hovering\" in the tree branches.  at first, i thought what i was seeing was a star and that i was simply \"swaying\" myself slightly so as to make the \"star\" appear as if it were \"moving through the branches\", however it's motions were not indicative of something like this at all!  i leaned up against my home and rested my head on it to be sure i wasn't moving and witnessed this little light move up the side of the tree's trunk, sometimes moving behind the tree and back out again.  it would move through the branches and i kept losing sight of it, then it would reappear.  knowing now that it wasn't my imagination, i moved away from the tree to find it appeared to be high up in the sky and just \"hovering\", but it would slowly move from side to side, then up and down, crossways and, at times, appeared to be \"bouncing and spiraling\" to a slight degree!  as i began to look at some of the other \"stars\" in the area...I found that as i focused on them, they would move in this very same fashion!!!  also, at this point, i realized that the ones that would move like this...Weren't \"twinkling\" as stars do, but that they were actually \"flashing\"!!!  also, i tested this on other stars to make sure that it wasn't an illusion of the eyes i was seeing to find that some of the stars did not move at all...As the others did!  i figured if i was \"seeing things\" that as i focused hard enough on any of them...They would all react the same way!  but this was not the case to any degree!\r\n\r\nalmost every cloudless night since this, i've been able to see a number of them high in the sky just \"hovering\" in the same general areas.  i suppose for those that aren't aware, they are simply the \"stars\" of the universe, but i believe that's how they're meant to appear unless you are one who is curious and aware enough to know that \"they\" are out there and you have the desire to know more!  i believe for those of us in this category, our galactic families want to reveal themselves to us!\r\n\r\non new year's eve, i noticed 2 hovering very much lower in the skies to the west of my home and about 10 feet above the some of the neighborhood homes.  also, i saw a light that appeared to be reflecting off the windows of one of the homes much closer to ground level and was the bright orangish color of the local street lamps, yet it was moving in that same \"hovering\" motion as the one over the tops of the homes.  i was distracted away from this momentarily and when i returned, the one over the houses was gone, but the other street lamp colored one remained, but was now away from the home and into the woodsy area beside the home.  since seeing this light, i've noticed many more of these and other colored lights where \"street lights\" weren't before.  there's also others that are simply a bright white like the typical color of a porch light and some that are the bluish tint of the new led  style lights or even a greenish hue that is also the color of street lamps.  they appear to take on the colors of real lights in the surrounding so as to mask themselves better.  they also seem to remain hidden in the depths of the surrounding wooded areas and don't \"come out\" or show themselves unless they are observed!  now that i know they are \"out there\" i'm able to find more and more all the time and witness more activity from them!  tonight, saturday...January 24th, one of the \"stars\" appears high in the sky over south horizon, i watched of the lighted orbs seem to fall to the ground, although there was nothing visible on the ground afterward, one that was clearly \"out in the open\" yesterday is hidden in the protection of the woods, barely visible!  many of the other ones i see regularly remain in their \"normal\" areas!  everyday brings witness to a new experience in one form or another!  this is absolutely amazing!!!  :-d ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":62851,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.77169784699981,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01242015-0014","longitude":-84.42244361948156,"occurred":1422079200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1422154045000,"summary":"There appears to be these glowing and hovering orbs or lights throughout the area in which i live.

the time i was working at a job laying sod and we had been picking up pallets of sod from this place in edmonton for two weeks. on this one day my boss sends me and a couple other guys on a run to pick up some sod. when we arrived we discovered black suburban sand black helicopters flying around behind the place that sold the sod  so i asked the employee what was goin on and he said that they had found crop circles in the field ,he also said we could go look if we wanted. as we walked into the field i was very nervous the scene was out of x files very weird as we approached people were taking measurements and doing tests of some kind. so you know i'm not bull shitting you just search edmonton crop circles . these  \"scientists \" told me that there has never been anything like this found in north america so read about it because this is just the beginning.  so  about a few days go buy and my friends and i are out at about 12 am and happen to be driving down the road that i had seen the crop circles and as i looked out the window i saw. strange lights exactly over the spot wher inhad seen the crop circles.  i then made my friend pull over the car imideiatly we then proceeded to stand right under this object that appeared to be massive in size shaped like a triangle with odd white lights  for about 2 min and then it vanished in a link of an eye . the two friends i was with don't talk about what happened . everyone i know thinks i'm cray .  fast forward 8 years i'm with some other. friends driving down the same road same time of year all of a sudden all the hair stands

on or around dec 4 2014 i was sitting in my family room watching tv when  i noticed what i thought was an airplane flying towards my house. i live appx 2000 feet up on the hillside and i have a excellent view of the city of riverside. iv'e lived in this area for 40 years and am used to seeing all kinds of aircraft from air refuelers flying out of march to commercial flights from ont and lax. yes my view is that good on winter nights. anyway i was looking at the planes flying this particular night and noticed one flying straight towards my house. no big deal so i glanced at it and then watched some more tv. after a couple of minutes i looked at the object again and thought by now it should have already flown over. i dismissed it and kept watching tv. another minute goes by and i look again and it's still coming at me and it's flying so low, about 4000 ft. so i get up and walk out back to get abetter look.It was a big object as it approached. there were two rows of 4 or 5 white bright lights on it's underside. as it got even closer i thought how come i don't here any noise. i live in a canyon and believe me when a refueler is that close it shakes my house. at this point i was totally baffled. at first i reasoned it was a blimp, but it was the fastest blimp i ever saw. too slow for a jet to stay airborn. then about 3/4 of a mile it banked left and flew north over box springs mtn. and when it banked i relized blimps don't bank. the object was triangular and very large an made absolutely silent. as large as a c5 galaxy, even larger. weird!! i don,t know if this has anything to do with it but the next couple of days i noticed civilian passenger planes flying out of march. the jets were all white with a blue stripe running dowd the length of it and no other markings.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
