for dinner.\r\n\r\nthe iss was the best i've ever seen. the body was illuminated and the solar panels were to it's sides one to the north and one to the south folded like wings. i had parked the car in the east gate shopping center parking lot and tried to get a better view with my small binoculars, they didn't help so i grabbed my large 50mm binoculars from the trunk and couldn't focus in time.\r\n\r\nafter the iss had departed to the east north east and was going out of sight i went in to mr. wonton's to pick up my food which i had called in.\r\nonce outside at my car i called my friend who alerted me to the iss. as we were talking he asked if i saw a second object traveling with or beside the iss and i said no.\r\n\r\nthen to the east, directly east of the shopping center at 30 degrees i saw an object that looked like the iss! it had the same appearance which is very unique except it was low 500 feet or lower and its body was illuminated cherry red in an hour glass shape. the white portion was exactly like the iss solar panels. it was in slow flight, not hovering. i told my friend and don't know if i described it i was so excited. \r\n\r\ni don't know what it was. it was unlike any airplane or helicopter ive seen\r\nand my binoculars were in the car. i couldn't take my eyes off it except for an instant when i told my friend i'll try to capture it on the iphone.\r\n\r\nthe photo did not turn out all i could get was a bright light in the sky higher than street lights.\r\n\r\ni watched the object for several minutes till it receded from view. i got in car thinking maybe i could chase it but realized it was already a mile or so away and chasing it in suburban traffic would be fruitless.\r\n\r\ni can later do a sketch of the object and perhaps find a

specifically to observe the moon, which my son has been tracking for his class studies. when i did, i both saw the moon, as well as a low-flying triangular-shaped object that appeared stationary. i slowed my vehicle, and pulled to the side of the road to observe it. i was almost home & our subdivision is close to both buckley air force base as well as wide open space east of the denver-aurora metro area. at first glance, i believed the object to be one of the many aircraft often sighted over the air force base; however most of those craft fly during daylight hours, & in 13 years in living at this location, i have never observed a craft looking like this one. i observed the triangle-shaped craft hovering, then abruptly moving in an arcing & zigging pattern, low than slightly raising in altitude, in oblique path to buckley air force base for approximately just over a minute. initially i believed it must be an airplane, but after seeing its unusual movements, as well as visually comparing the size of it to other aircraft in the nearby airspace (which there are regularly many - we live about 20 miles south of denver international airport), it became clear to me this was an enormously-sized aircraft compared to other visually observable craft in the night sky. it also moved distinctly differently from anything else i saw tonight - or virtually any night - although in years past i have been witness to other unusual aerial phenomenon (particularly when i lived in boulder county, colorado). the object hovered, changed direction slightly, then arced away at an increasing speed, first south, then accelerating in a north-eastern arc, towards the air force base & dia. as it moved away, i resume following it with my car, finally losing track as it moved too far east for me to observe any longer over the suburban housing subdivision.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
