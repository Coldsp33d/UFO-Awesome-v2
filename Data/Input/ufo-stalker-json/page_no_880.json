across two that had elements i hadn't seen when i'd been taking them. to be clear: i did not see the objects until the day after the event. at the time the images were captured i did not see anything i thought was unusual or abnormal. a description of the time of the event follows.\r\n\r\ni was at a construction site right by the whelie-reston east metro station taking photos for a project. as it was getting pretty cold out, i decided to make my next photos the last before heading out. i set up my camera on a tripod for a long exposure of the highway figuring it might make an interesting shot. my camera settings for both photos were iso 200 f/11 at a 30 second exposure, the second picture was taken approximately one minute after the first. during the this time i did not see any unusual lights or hear any unusual sounds. i suspect that the brightness of area i was in didn't allow my eyes to adjust to be able to see the relatively subtle green lights in the dark sky.\r\n\r\nnotes: \r\nat in a 30 second exposure, lights that don't hold still will leave \"light trails\" in the final picture, just as the cars did, these objects however don't appear to have left any, leading me to think they either were only momentarily present, or they were completely still for the duration of the exposure. \r\n\r\nthe camera was facing roughly south, the white lights and antenna visible on the right are most likely from the hughes middle school/south lakes high school, which lie in that direction.\r\n\r\ni checked for meteor showers in the area, and there was one that was visible in the area on the two days prior, but again: moving lights such as meteors would have left streaks/light trails in the photo, which is not the case.\r\n\r\non the second photo in particular, a vague circular outline can be made out around some of the lights, suggesting the light is being emitted by these circular objects.\r\n\r\ni am not sure what the yellow light trails are/were left by, but they look unrelated to the  green lights as those appear to be in formation.","distance":"Over One

this recent visit began last night, in my apartment. \r\n\r\ni walked into my bedroom, taking off my uniform, after work. from the corner of my eye, i saw a mist-like movement made of white light, which moved horizontally from left to right, turned near the wall, and moved upward at about fifteen degrees. the motion was fluid, and the turn had a curvature to it as it happened. dismissing it, i turned off the light, and walked in to my living room. it was here that i saw the form directly, as i stared, lost in thought, toward my kitchen. it moved in front of me, about four feet from the floor, from right to left. it was much like a cloud, but it did not disperse, as smoke would. it moved into my son's bedroom. which was empty and dark at the time, and lies on the other side of my apartment. i felt as though i were not alone, and called out. \"i saw that,\" i said. \"you ought to know that you can't hide from me.\" i heard a sound coming from the room, which sounded like one of the toys being moved, or disturbed. \"there's no reason to hide,\" i said. \"i'm not going to hurt you. just come out slowly, and we can talk.\" the sounds happened again, and i walked to the open doorway of my son's room, and looked into the darkness. \"if i try hard enough, i'll be able to see you. there's no reason to go hiding in the dark. that's why people are afraid of you. it's scary.\" in front of me, a shadow formed against the dimly lit wall in the bedroom. it was about seven feet tall, and shaped like the outline of a man. \"there you go,\" i said. \"still, this shadow stuff is pretty creepy. just come out here, and we can talk. i'll move away from the door.\" i stepped back about twenty feet, into the middle of my living room. \"i'm nice, there's no reason to be afraid of me,\" i said. as i was speaking those words, a red-orange ball of light floated from my son's room, about five feet from the ground, and headed over my couch, and through the closed window. i saw it as clearly as i have seen anything else. a half-second after seeing it pass through the blinds (and presumably, the glass), i heard a commotion on my porch, and felt the vibration of something running down the stairs. i opened the door to see an enormous, mostly gray male calico cat walking briskly away. i have been watching the local cats at night, just in passing, and have given them all nicknames. i have never seen this cat before. he was the size of an english bulldog. i called out to him, and though his motion indicated that he had heard me, he did not slow down, or turn around.\r\n\r\nthey came for me again, later last night. i wasn't surprised.\r\n\r\ni have seen a few ufos, and have had several experiences. i have two working implants at the moment, and have even been able to keep four memories on board the craft. i have never even imagined a scenario like this.\r\n\r\ni would like to state, plainly, that i am relied upon by many people for my intellect, and analytical nature. i am not given to hallucinations, and am a well-adjusted, happy, and steadily employed man. i have been reluctant to share my experiences, and it is a well-kept secret that only a small number of people know about. after last night, i have decided to reach out, and attempt to find others who have experienced some of these occurrences.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

out the sky, i didn't notice the moon and mars was missing i just noticed the sparkling in the sky.\r\n\r\nshortly after that i was heading west on south diamond lake road in champlin, i was coming up to the lake it's self and off in the distance i noticed these really bright lights, as i came over the hill by the little chapel on the right i noticed 3 massive glowing lights in the sky, these lights started as a straight line then moved into a upside triangle formation, the lights were all different colors, from white to blue to orange. i quickly pulled over on a side road and got out of my car yet again to look, i called a buddy of mine who was staying at a hotel in the area to go outside and look but as soon as i hung up the phone the bottom light disappeared and then the two top lights shot off in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nthis isn't my first ufo sightings but as usually i feel very curious about them i was not afraid, but these 2 were so close together and so obvious i had

cruise to belgium. while returning i saw a shining object to the east. since it was early evening the sun was low in the west. there were clouds to the east and the object was stationary below the clouds. i watched the object for perhaps 20 minutes before it made a rapid vertical climb that took only seconds to disappear behind clouds.\r\nthe second experience occurred back in canada a couple of months later. while sleeping i felt myself being pulled through the air at tremendous speed. my face was contorted as a result of the g force. my next recollection was being in a dark space. in front of me there appeared to be some kind of instrument panel. in front of me at a short distance there was an entity. it was a silhouetted and the frontal features were not visible due to the darkness. there was no sound but i had a sense that there was some sort of communication. i did not feel any discomfort during this encounter, i didn't feel threatened in any way. my next awareness was in my bed. my face was hot and felt very dry. my body was completely paralysed. the paralysis while being totally aware of what had just happened was disconcerting. for the next ten years i regularly felt the pinging in my ear and had a feeling that some part of my mind was being uploaded. i have not had that experience for many years. there have been many occasions when i discover cuts or other marks on my body which i cannot explain.

into or came from the pond.  it was dark and a clear night.  suddenly from my left abruptly came this round white object.  it was not normal in several ways.  it began to hover in one spot but would move to the left or right and hover there. the way it moved has never left my mind.  it was suddenly in one spot then suddenly in another..There was no transition path...It was in one spot then in
