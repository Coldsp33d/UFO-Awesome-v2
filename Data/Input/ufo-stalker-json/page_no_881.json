(white/ red, white/red and white/red) and began moving in a easterly direction again. we observed them for about another 2 minutes until they moved out of our view. the official then got into his

could not see a plane at the front.  there was normal helicopter traffic, and there is a heliport on the west side highway of manhattan in the area where this object would have been flying over.  i'm

foi a minha experiência com ovni triangular, espero contribuir !\r\nesse relato enviei ao site: ([link moved to fi section/cms/tg]) no dia 07.04.2014, alguns dias depois de tomar coragem em tocar no assunto, levei um mês para contar aos amigos mais chegados, pois tinha medo de ser taxado de louco, bem agora tenho mais informações sobre o assunto, mas ainda a minha mente luta em me dizer que não há logica no que eu vi, no que senti e sinto até hoje é inexplicável !\r\n\"a história aconteceu na madrugada do 13/03/2014 as 0:35 hs, e estou transtornado, não sei o que pensar, o cérebro luta com o que vimos, com o seu lado racional e cético (pois até o ocorrido não acreditava em onvis, ets e etc…), mas tenho dois vídeos gravados do ovni….Nunca pensei na minha vida que iria ver o que vi….Bem vou tentar resumir:\r\neu e meu amigo ale (alessandro), estávamos indo nesta madruga para a fazenda dele no interior de carazinho, no qual em certa parte da estrada paramos perto de uma ponte entre são bento e tesouras (interior de carazinho) para mijar e ai começamos a olhar para o céu a contemplar a lua e a estrela, pois estava bem claro o céu, sem nuvens e com a lua quase cheia.\r\nlogo após algum tempo, começamos a falar como estava lindo o céu, nomeamos algumas estrelas, e constelações, tipo olha o cruzeiro do sul, as 3 marias, e etc…, foi aí que me deu uma sensação que estávamos sendo vigiados, pensei logo que era algum animal (cão ou algum animal selvagem) fiquei de costa para o meu amigo tentando ver algo no meio de um mato que tinha ao lado da estrada, foi ai que o meu amigo foi em direção da ponte, pois tínhamos passado por ela e parado uns 10 metros a frente e ele queria olhar o nível do rio, essas coisa de granjeiro gosta de analisar… então ele foi à direção da ponte, e eu estava de costa olhando para dentro mato, tentando ver alguma coisa, enquanto o meu amigo se aproximava da ponte, foi ai que do nada surgiu “o grito”, um urro horrível, como um animal feroz e grande, tipo um leão na jaula, mas um urro era de susto ou de ameaça, (não era cão, pois estamos acostumado com latido de cachorros, lobos guarás, graxains, etc…mas o urro foi uma coisa que eu nunca ouvimos antes, um coisa assustadora demais, eu só gritei para o ale:- corre, vamos sair daqui, já pulando para dentro do carro, sem ao menos olhar para traz (não tive coragem de olhar no momento), o ale veio correndo e entrou dentro carro, e disse que não viu nada, só claro ouvido o grito assustador que estava na sua direção, mas disse que vinha da ponte. assim fizemos o retorno e fomos na direção da ponte , foi ai que vimos os olhos brilhando no escuro de alguma criatura tipo 1.30 m de altura, com os olhos grandes e brilhando conforme o farol do carro se aproximava, e ficou claro que a criatura ficou encarando-nos, enquanto se aproximávamos da ponte. quando chegamos na ponte a criatura foi adentro do mato, sem podermos identificar o que era , só podemos ver que era bípede de olhos grandes e brilhante e aproximadamente 1,30m de altura. mas não foi só isso…\r\no que realmente foi fantástico, inacreditável, e surreal foi o que aconteceu alguns minutos depois desse fato, estamos apavorados e comentando o que tinha acontecido momentos antes e nessa altura estamos voltando para carazinho, pois não tínhamos coragem de seguir para fazenda, foi que após percorrermos alguns km voltando, já quase em carazinho ( entre são bento e carazinho), foi que avistei um brilho no céu, primeiramente parecia um avião, ou um helicóptero (este ultimo nunca vi nessas bandas e tem o seu som característico), mas o brilho foi aumentando, e sem som com diversas luzes (vermelhas, azuis e brancas) e notei que a ovni estava parado , tipo nos esperando na estrada a cima dela uns 20 metros de altura, fomos diminuindo a velocidade para ver o que era (só de me lembrar agora já me arrepio ), o onvi era triangular de uns 50 metros (era enorme), essa altura estava tentando filmar com o meu celular desde o momento que eu avistei a luz no céu, no horizonte, mas meu celular não gravou nada, não sei se foi pelo pavor ou alguma interferência da coisa, ali pairando no ar, (sem som algum, tipo de motor ), bem ai peguei o celular do ale e tentando filmar o ovni, a essa altura a coisa estava sobre nos na estrada e nós parado em baixo (aos berros e pedindo a deus ajuda, apavorados), (me arrepiei de novo, cruz credo), estava filmando com a cabeça para fora da janela do carro, foi aí que o ovni, tipo ligou os motores, digamos que era motores, sei lá o que era… as luzes começaram a piscar e trocar de cor, muito rapidamente, eu pensei na hora “já era cara, tamo fu, a coisa ou vai mandar um raio e nos desintegrar ou vai nos abduzir ” mas então a coisa fez um barulho muito forte, como já disse tipo ligando alguma coisa e com as luzes brilhando, piscando e trocando de cor, saiu dali zunindo, voando com um rapidez incrível, lembrando que o coisa estava sobre nos, pairando , sem fazer nem um tipo de som , até ligar esses motores (não sei ao certo, acho que era os motores da coisa). bem nessa altura estávamos apavorados, tremendo, sem compreender o que era coisa voadora, que nos esperava na estrada, apos o contato com o “bicho” visto minutos antes. não sei se os dois fatos estão interligados, sei que foi uma coincidência muito grande, bem tenho dois vídeos das luzes, pois não consegui gravar no modo noturno, no momento estava apavorado e o celular não era o meu e não sabia mexer direito, mas tenho a gravação….\r\nbem fomos para a minha casa tentar baixar no computador os vídeos e contar aos nossos familiares o ocorrido, pesquisei na net e vi que tem vários relatos, fotos, vídeos e desenho de ovnis triangulares semelhantes o que vimos.\r\nbem estou até agora apavorado, e não consigo parar de pensar no que vimos….Mas ta gravado, por isso, sei que não foi alucinação, foi real, foi real….Não consegui dormir até agora….(levei dois dias para conseguir dormir).\r\ntenho muito mais detalhes de coisas que vimos e sentimos que não sei me expressar agora….\r\nabraços e até….\r\nmarcos klein\"\r\ntem o meu relato verbal e comentário do sr. fabio del santoro no programa vozes do universo do dia 30.05.2014 = pvu 196 ([link moved to fi section/cms/tg]) essa pagina demora para carregar, pois tem muitos programas, esperem se forem acessar.\r\nos videos estão no youtube, que me refiro são estes , mas estes [links moved to fi section/cms/tg]\r\nbem tentamos gravar com dois celulares no momento, mas só um gravou, este que gravou, pensei que tinha mais de 3 mim. de gravação, mas não sei se pelo pavor ou por interferencial da nave ou manipulação do vídeos por \"eles\", só apareceu 28 seg. no 1º video , isso foi instantes após a nave ter pairado em cima do carro, o 2º vídeos tem 2 seg. aparece a luz branca de relance quando a nave sai voando muito rapidamente... \r\nmandei esse videos para a revista ufo e eles me responderam:\r\n\"olá, marcos!\r\no que mais se destaca nos vídeos são as luzes azuis e vermelhas do painel de instrumentos do veículo. se o objeto a que você se refere é a pequena luz branca que aparece por uma fração de segundo no vídeo mais curto (ovni_2), então sinto informar que, devido a extrema exiguidade de pixels correspondentes ao objeto (muito pequeno), este vídeo não apresenta condições técnicas de uma análise mais acurada.\r\nmuitos dos casos que nos chegam são assim mesmo, ou seja, na ansiedade de capturar e enfocar um objeto que se afasta e se move rapidamente, as filmagem obtidas perdem demais quanto as condições técnicas para um exame.\r\nnestes casos, vale muito mais relato das testemunhas do que a imagem captada, sondo o vídeo considerado como \"sem condições técnicas de exame\"!\r\nespero contribuir e ajuda (e ajudar) no sentido de conseguir entender melhor essa experiência, compartilhando esses fatos !\r\nabçs a todos !","distance":"20 Feet or

a bad idea to compare notes with others who may have experienced this event.","distance":"101-500

brother-in-law work on the roof of his trailer that evening. i was facing south and he was directly across from me facing north. i just simply looked up from my work and seen the craft hovering approximately 60 yards in front of me directly over the tygart river. it was round, metallic and had squared corners that stepped down from the top to sides. had no visible windows but it had multicolored lights on it that dimmed and brightened. these lights did not cast on anything around the object or the object itself. it made absolutely no noise at any time. immediately upon seeing it i just stared at it. it was as if time had frozen. i had stopped working but my brother-in-law never noticed during my viewing of the object. i could not take my eyes off it. all i would have had to do was tell him to look behind him but i was unable to do that. not out of fear. i was strangely calm. at no time before, during, or after the sighting have i experienced fear as a result of the sighting. i just watched it hover for it seemed like 5 minutes and it slowly started drifting down the river. it went behind some treetops and never emerged. i saw something occur behind the trees but not sure what. i just knew it was gone at that point. at that point everything was normal again. i could move and just began working again. i could not tell my brother-in-law what had happened. something wouldn't let me. i remembered it a lot but never spoke of it for years until i told my sister and then later my wife. besides this report that is the only people i've ever shared it with. i felt controlled throughout the entire viewing. its a very hard feeling to describe. this object was very large and very close to me. i see it as clearly today as i did when i first saw it. the thing that puzzles me the most was the feeling of control it had over me. it was so peaceful. the best i can describe it would be like freezing a moment in time except for yourself and the object and being able to focus on everything around you at your leisure while time is on pause. it sounds strange but it happened. i don't know why i was aloud to experience it, but its something i will never forget. the dates are approximate on this but it was definitely summer of 1993. i remember that because it was right before my scheduled date to leave for basic training in the u.S. army.

the type of low rumble that sometimes lightly vibrates window panes. i looked at the clock and it was about 2:05 am, and my ears were surveying the truck sound as my mind began to wonder, while my body wanted sleep. where is this truck and why is it idling outside my house or at a distance was all i could think.\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes of listening i realized a logical pattern to the hum, and recognized it was something else. id like to mention i am an audio engineer by former trade and with schooling to match, with a lot of time spent playing with synthesizers and sounds all sorts of gear, which from these interests i was hooked and had to get out of my bed to start listening some more. i was absolutely thrown for a loop and wide awake...\r\n\r\ni put my ears to the walls in my room, i put my ears to my bedroom floor, i opened the windows, left ear first, right ear next, trying to localize the source, of course this is hard or impossible with low end, , i was simply could not understand what on earth is that sound. only thing i could imagine was a teenager with a keyboard and a high powered 2000 watt sub woofer that could produce low end energy of a jet plane, with finesse and subtly. the pattern was mechanical but also slightly natural feeling in its delivery, a feeling of intelligence and purpose.\r\n\r\nfor those who know audio the sound appeared to pitch up and down, in a defined pattern from about approx. 20-25hz to maybe 30-35hz, with a drone like quality, a slow ride up, a stop, then pitch down, it appeared to be reaching a area as wide as pasco county. it felt like it was coming from a source several hundred miles away and with a energy of massiveness, only due to my studies does my mind think in this way.\r\n\r\ni decided i had enough and got dressed, this whole time i will say my hairs on my  body were standing up as though in fear or something just unknown, \r\n\r\nonce outside my door i verified as best as my trained ears could do, that the sound was indeed coming from above, and was faint but also gigantic in presence, i know what it takes energetically to produce such a faint low rumble, to the un trained ear, its nothing, but this was no freggin joke. with less than a minute outside i tell you i ran back into my house in some sort of fear came over me, as though a voice was saying, go back inside. there was a eerie feeling in the air out there, add to it the air and i was starting to hear more layers to the sounds, lighter tones almost like a horn or a digereedoo. there is no reason for me to write this much but i want to see if others have experienced this. \r\n\r\ni wont add any further comments, for those who are skeptical skip this last bit.... i consider myself psychic / empath in a humbled un-said, un ego driven way. i sense and do receive words and images from other sides... and when i asked this night \"what are you\", what i gathered in response was that these sounds were a type of energetic work on the grids and lay-lines of earth and of a good nature.\r\n\r\nafter a hour of listening, i put earplugs in and still heard the lows through the ear plugs of course, slightly zapped and weird ed out i fell back asleep. ive been telling everyone i know, but nobody gives a [verbiage removed/cms/rjl], and i look like a lunatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":62787,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.1762689,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01212015-0014","longitude":-82.2962239,"occurred":1421834700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1421893221000,"summary":"Strange

pulled into the church to take a look.  i had noticed to objects that looked like fire balls heading in a southern direction.  one was training  ways behind the other and both had taken on a horizontal path almost.  as i was watching them i noticed a third object just appear out of nowhere high in the sky like it was just dropped.  it was going fast and also left a trial behind it.  i video taped and snapped pictures of the three for a while and noticed a 4th one appear in the sky but this one was heading north instead of south.  as i was snapping a picture and before i could change it back to video i watched it doe some kind of a half flip turn upwards and over flip and then was now facing in the southern direction like the other 3.  the first 2 had gotten to far for me to watch so i focused on the last 2.  as the third one kept moving i could see it take on a more straight horizontal path and the tail behind it was getting shorter and then it was like morphing into a sphere that had a glow around it and just pretty much stopped and hovered in place.  while that was going on the 4th one kept dropping in altitude and could see it start to take a slight curve into a straighter line on its path. the 3rd one was still just hovering in that same area and it seemed like as the 4th one got closer it was starting to light up more like its flames or tail was starting to get longer again and then when the 4th one got to a close enough point the 3rd one starting moving slowly and in a southern direction still then after a few minutes of me watching it it just vanished out of site and i was moving the camera around to locate it but couldn't see it anywhere so i stopped and headed to work.  the 4th one had moved behind the tree lines and i just seen a orange glow that kept moving when i stopped taping.  my brother said its a meteor but a meteor wouldn't go from a falling diagonal path to a horizontal path and it would just stop traveling hover in place and just be a white sphere and then light up brighter and then take off or as with the 4th one a meteor would not change its direction and go the opposite direction of the way it came in falling into the atmosphere.  he obviously didn't look at the videos i shot. i also had trouble getting it to focus because the powerless were in my way and it kept wanting to focus more on the closer object. the videos are kind of shaky because the camera was heavy with the 500 mm lens on it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

cotswalds region. our last day was in bath and we planned to visit the landmards, the first one was the royal crescent and we even went inside in no1 royal crescent (a museum like preserved house, part of the entire crescent).\r\nwe walked among the rooms on the first floor and then we went to the ones on the second floor.\r\nusing of camera and taking photos was forbidden everywhere inside the rooms.\r\nin the gentelman's room on the second floor was an open window, then i asked the attendant whether i can take a photo from this window to the royal crescent from outside and she agreed.\r\nthen i photographed the building exterior from this open window.\r\nthis is the picture where i think there is an ufo on it and it can be clearly seen over the building.\r\ni am submitting it along with this report.\r\nat the time when i was taking the shot i did not see these lights.\r\ni shoot in raw format and after 3 months i processed the raw image and saw these strange lights.\r\nat first i thought it was a reflection of what looks like a chandelier but when i go back in my mind i realize that this might hardly happen at the spot where i was shooting.\r\nremember i was shooting from a second floor room, from an open window to the outside. these lights in my humble opinion could not be reflected from inside the room.\r\ni am sorry that i can't remember whether there was a chandolier in the room and whether it was the same shape, i could take picture inside the room. i tried to find it out online but could find any pictures of the room's lighting, only a couple of picture on the other side of the room.\r\n\r\ni don't see any chandolier on them and can't remember where and what were the lights.\r\n\r\ni am sending you the original raw file without any manipulation.\r\n\r\ni never noticed the lights live, i noticed them when i was looking closely on this photo several months later.\r\n\r\nall the above information i gave in the report is based on the lights of the photo (positioning, distance, shape).\r\n\r\ni would really like you to examine this photo and tell me whether i saw something or there is another explanation. the lights are on the upper right side on the picture.\r\n\r\ni don't claim this is a real ufo but i don't have another explanation (except reflections from inside the room but i really find this hard to happen).\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

do with the people involved, but i am only reporting this as i would like to know more about it myself, and the fact that possibly it was never reported or thoroughly investigated. perhaps it was, and mufon has already investigated this, i don't know that, but just putting this out there in case it was not.\r\n\r\nseveral years back i saw a video online of what was showing two mysterious objects hovering and floating around above a field and trees. originally, to my recollection the video was unedited, and had several portions of the video where the objects were no longer visible from sight. the video was nearly 12-15 minutes long in its entirety. the comments on the video were of the most part negative, claiming the objects to merely be tractors. i agree with the fact the arrangement of lighting does look like that of a tractor. but the way the objects float and seemingly dance around definitely gives one the impression that these objects are not on the ground, but hovering through the air.\r\n\r\nit was probably days, perhaps weeks later, when i had went back to view the video to find the original replaced with a shorter, edited video, showing a brief analysis of the video, which showed to prove that the objects were actually hovering in the sky as opposed to driving on the ground.\r\n\r\ni know the above states to not include a url link, but i am doing so to show the video it is that i am referring to. again please note, i do not know the parties involved with this video! i am sending this report to you, because i myself would like to know more about it, and the fact that there are no other ufo videos out there, that truly give me the goosebumps more than this video itself.\r\n\r\ni myself really believe the video and objects to be genuine. what they are? i have no clue, but it honestly scares the crap out of me, and most the folks i show it to are generally creeped out as well.\r\n\r\nthe video can be seen here: [link moved to fi
