this steep hill next to our house down to a stream. he pointed to the southwest and over the trees, coming towards us along the same direction of the river was a gigantic boomerang shaped object, it looked like a stealth bomber, but it was much, much larger. birds were coming from that direction and flying swiftly away from the craft. the craft had hundreds of lights on the bottom, the were in a patterned panel shape, and the colors rippling from  a bright point, where 2 smaller crafts came out and dropped down about 200 feet from the main point, and stopped suddenly, they did not have any lights, and were in a shape of a cube, than moving ahead of the main craft, disappeared into the trees. the craft than changed directions and moved slowly to the south. i ran back to the house by myself, where it was still visible. most of my family were awake because my uncles sheep were screaming and making lots of noise. we took 3 other younger members down to the stream right away, and the craft barely moved, and we sat there for the next 15 minutes, and saw 4 box objects return instead of 2. my cousins said no other boxed objects were released. the 4 objects came back to the same enter spot and disappeared inside the craft. after the craft disappeared behind a hill where trees were blocking the view. it was gone half an hour after we first saw it, we ran back to the house as fast as we could, scared half to death. later that evening, we were paralyzed with fear, and about 4:30, we went back to the same spot armed with knives, sharp branches and about half a pound of cherry bombs, m80s and other firecrackers. we hiked 300 yards towards the area where we saw the 4 boxes take off, and a strong smell of a chalky, brick like smell. the temperature rised when we got closer to where the smell was coming from. one of my cousins called me over and we found the soil was dry when everywhere else was wet, and had a yellow square spot. we found 3 similar spots, and in between the 3, i found a unusual australian coin, and when i tried to pick it up, it burned, and i found the side of the coin facing up was hot, and the side facing down was cool to the touch. over the next few days, i had some pimples, or even discoloration or even burns on my back that grew quickly, but faded after a week. the burned spots on the ground were gone the next day. a total of 13 people saw the craft, 4 neighbors, my grandparents, 3 cousins, and 3 other friends, as well as another family member, younger than me.","distance":"Over One

like interference.  lasted about 30 seconds and me and my husband just looked at each other.  the tv turned back to normal like nothing happened and the picture was clear the whole time just the voice was different and loud, like the volume turned up all the way on its own and had a different channels voice going, female i think.  well my husband left and i went to get something to eat and did not see any lights were i seen them yesterday as i went down the street. when i turned east onto the main drag i seen a flickering light in the clouds that looked faint.  after the clouds cleared it got brighter and was aligned up with the road pretty much well i pilled over to take a video and it dimmed and i didn't see it again.  after waiting a few minutes i left and headed east again towards a food joint when i seen it flickering faintly  but now t was a lil north of the road.  well i proceeded to find a dark spot to take a video and it dimmed and i couldn't see it anymore.  so i turned south to get on the main drag and seen it infront of me so i pulled over and was able to get a video this time.  it was just above a single story building but further back.  as i was taping i thought it was moving but my camera must have wavered while i was filming it.  so i stopped to head home and headed west then turned south onto my street and i seen another multicolored flickering light that was just west of the road about 80 feet, so i pulled into the church parking lot and faced south and started filming this one as well.  same one from a few minutes ago i don't know.  well i got back into the car and turned south onto my street and noticed that the multicolored flickering light was now directly in line with my street instead of to the west of it a few seconds ago.  i go a couple blocks to my house and start to take another video of it and called my daughter and her boyfriend out to look at it.  well i finished filming and went inside to look at them.  i noticed that they all from the last 4 days have one single white flashing light either above it or below it either flickering faster than the big light or just a short glimp of a light.  they all had that in common.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":62755,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.398346637096825,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01202015-0011","longitude":-94.95292862303778,"occurred":1421735400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1421750194000,"summary":"Seen

driving. structurally, it resembled a blimp but was long and narrow enough to be considered a cigar shaped ufo. i looked online to see if there are any military (or civilian) aircraft that resemble it and also asked my father, who was a pilot for years and is also an amateur astronomer. the closest thing i could find was a half-scale model of an airship that will be tested by the military in 2016 but to my knowledge hasn't been flown yet and is still being constructed.\r\n\r\nat the tail of the craft were flashing red and white lights, not unlike an airplane. i studied it carefully until it
