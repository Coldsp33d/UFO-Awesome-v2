huge part of it from here), and even though it was already 6:00 pm at the time it was still almost as bright as a day can be (summer time), when he saw a strangely bright light in the sky and showed me, amazed. i tought it was just a star, but after some seconds i remind myself that stars don't stand below clouds, so it couldn't be one. we were thinking it was maybe a plane, but planes can't stand still. and an helicopter can't fly so high, but if it do fly so high they are not that silent. then, that light got just a little closer and bigger. looking closely, we noticed that was probably a metallic object reflecting sun light, and this is why it was shining through the blue sky. suddenly, it started moving around, and some very little shining objects came out of it, flying very fast but still in weird, curvy directions. this is when the main object got a red glow right below it, the star-like shine still being the main color though. then red became green. and green became just a blue that was brighter than the sky. at this moment, i tried to take a picture/film it, but i am pretty bad at cameras and the image got no focus, so the image was blur and we couldn't see the object. this repeated for about one minute, red to green, to blue, to red, and then it slowly went up away, through the clouds, and finally disappeared after fading away. we couldn't really understand what that was and stayed there for some time, waiting to see if it would come back, but nothing happened. in the end, looking at it made me dizzy, probably because of trying to see the little fast objects.","distance":"101-500

i had taken.\r\n\r\ni am a licensed pilot, with instrument rating, and a former amateur astronomer, so i'm accustomed to observing the skies and noticing details...These lights were definitely not visible to the naked eye at the time the photo was taken.\r\n\r\nthe lights did not appear in any other photo, either before or after the one being attached, so i doubt this was a malfunction of the camera in my phone. there were also no other point light sources in the general area that might have been bright enough to cause reflections in the lens.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what these lights were, but thought it strange enough to report to you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":62729,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.370991320073976,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01192015-0012","longitude":-106.55713092853759,"occurred":1421377500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

over the lake as i often do and saw a bright shimmering light about 2 miles off shore.  it looked just like a bright star when looking to the sky at nighttime only this was in the early afternoon and this appeared to be on the lake surface. i see a wide variety of things out on the lake but nothing like this.  i considered that perhaps it was something floating in the lake that was reflecting the sunlight but still it was so bright.  i immediately looked through my telescope which is situated at the window to investigate more.  the lake had some areas covered in ice and still a lot of water.  as i viewed the object through the telescope it still appeared somewhat blurry.  it looked as though it was 3 bright light spheres hovering close enough together that from the naked eye it would look like 1 bright star.  i know the telescope was focused in properly because i could see the fine details of the ice chunks floating directly underneath this unexplained light.  it appeared to be hovering maybe 15 ft. above the water surface. the light didn't appear to be moving in any direction.  from the naked eye it did get brighter and then dimmer randomly.  through the telescope it did the same thing only it seemed to vibrate for lack of a better term.  it's almost as if the reason i couldn't get a clear focus was because it was vibrating or perhaps because it wasn't a solid object.  i watched it for several minutes and was at a loss for what it might be.  i walked away for a few minutes and when i returned it was no longer there.  a few days later i decided to google unexplained lights over lake erie and much to my surprise discovered many others have seen similar sightings near my location.","distance":"Over One

speed.  they made no noise.  i had binoculars and viewed them, but still they only looked like orbs.  like flying geese there was a little bit of wavy motion to the orbs as they traveled in a line east.  after they disappeared from view over the horizon.  i looked up into the sky in the area the object had passed with my binoculars and i saw what looked like a series of three satellites very high up outside the atmosphere.  two satellites were traveling north to south and one was traveling south east to north west.  the whole of the incident could not have taken more than 20 seconds.  i said to myself that is a definite \"what is it.\"     about nine years ago while star gazing in winter i saw what looked very much like a satellite traveling very fast in high orbit.  the light was

to the parking lot so i could get my car and return to home base in the ### bldg.\r\ni was half way to my car when i saw a triangle shaped object stationary and or hovering which seemed to be only about 100 feet or so above the top of the parking lot lighting or lamp posts. i could see 3 lights @ each corner of  the triangle object and they were recessed up into the object itself.\r\n note:about a year or so ago, i watched a program / documentary on the belgium lights and and again the same programming last night 01-16-2015\r\nthe object / craft / ship described is identical to that craft except for the red light in the center, i do not recall seeing a red light. i was going to submit my sighting after the first viewing of the program in question but thought to myself what difference would it make. my sighting pre-dates the sightings in belgium. my work back in 1987 was operating 24/7 and was to my knowledge the largest semi-conductor manufacturing facilities on the east coast and was the largest customer of nyseg ( the regional power company) and only a few miles north of indian point nuclear power generation facilities. i had a great career @ ### that started @ the ## ###### research facilities in ######## (######## ##### ##) in 1977 and ended in #### ####### in 1987. i resigned from ### a month or two after my encounter. i was 28 years old in 1987. and now am 56, my life prior to seeing this ( whatever it was ) was on a path to success, but for the past 28 years it has been one un-wise decision after another causing nothing but struggle trials & tribulations for my life. \r\n note: i don't know if what i am about to type is relevant, a month or so after my sighting on a night that i was not working i woke up from a sound sleep and was completely / utterly terrified unable to speak or move and had a sense that i was not alone. in 28 years i have had three of the encounters and or experiences these are not dreams i am completely awake and aware.\r\nnow after all that i will get back to the object itself. when i first became aware of the object i was excited ( wow thats somthing i have never seen before) then i began to analyze and rationalize what i was looking at and had no reasonable explanation for what i was witnessing. and that's when i realized i was the main focus and that this object had become aware of me, or so it seemed. i became terrified and ran back into the ### bldg. and called the main security office to report what i had just saw, they laughed and made lite of it which kinda calmed me down enough to go back out to the parking lot and when i did the object was gone. again with being relevant, i have had a interest in aviation since i was a child and know the difference between what is possible when it come to flight characteristics of different types of aircraft. i also am a ga licensed pilot ( not current at the moment).Now unless the military or cia had been testing some secret program what i observed was impossible.My question to you is their any information or data on the effects that observing this object has caused any kind of problems for the people who witnessed the  triangle shaped object.

can't be a plane cause its just hovering there and wondered if it was what i have been telling them about that i have been seeing since december.  anyway i turned around towards the southwest direction and noticed a golden light again still in the same area but it looked like it was descending down towards the roof tops of the houses.  the light seemed big and was a golden color to me.  this  i took a short video of as well and snapped a couple pictures and turned back around to see the first flickering light and then i noticed  another golden light and a small plane in the same area.  the golden light seemed to stay hovering while the plane moved in a northern direction from a southern direction.  i would say that they were both around tree top level , maybe just a little higher up.  maybe it seemed a mile or so away in height.  i believe the video shows the tree lines. i also video taped the two of them.  you can tell the plane lights were totally different than the
