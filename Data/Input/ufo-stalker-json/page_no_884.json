\r\n\r\nit was then i took my iphone out and attempted to film it. as with all sightings, the footage is very poor quality but you can tell by how much  i was freaked out by this by my hand shaking on the camera. the object was not moving in all directions. it was a straight line.\r\n\r\ni posted the video on facebook where someone commented they had seen it on it's flightpath south of my location.\r\n\r\ni've seen a few documentaries in my time and am aware what a weather balloon can look like. this looked nothing like it.The fact that it was going in such a straight line suggests it was controlled ruling out a lantern as well.\r\n\r\nlogically i would think it must be a helicopter/drone. i am aware there have been a lot of helicopters flying over in the past with the search light on so i know what that looks like. this was at least 3 x bigger than a helicopter could be and too close to be a plane. drones are relatively small so i'm not even going to consider this, but like i said earlier there was no sound so it was definitely not one of these.\r\n\r\ni am seriously freaked out by this so would love to know exactly what this was...Any thoughts??\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":62712,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.6818752,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-01182015-0015","longitude":-3.2313584,"occurred":1421641200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wales","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1421635958000,"summary":"Oversized orb flies past my house in rhymney valley, south wales, uk","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62712_submitter_file1__15.01.18Sighting20.15.mp4"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"CF818NJ","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Bargoed, Wales","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:65923"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Los Angeles","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have been observing several large, geometric clouds for weeks that seems to cross the los angeles skies almost daily. on this sunday morning, i had some weird electromagnetic feelings and the animals all around were acting funnyâ€¦dogs barking, birds making odd noises, horses whinnying, etc. it was also accompanied by a rumble that sounds similar to a military jet tooling around over the mountains between the high desert (where edwards air force base and los angeles). as this particular cloud got close, i shot several images, each at about one minute apart. the sunlight was so blinding that i was not able to see the images on my screen. i did not actually see these with my own eyes, but i most definitely felt their presence. there were vibrations in the earth that were almost undetectable. i believe all of the animals around felt it and that is why they were all sounding off. \r\n\r\nin my previous observations. there would be a vibration felt by the animals and then the clouds would change their shape. an example would be from circles to right angles or triangles to waves. i have also noticed ripples in the cirrocumulus cloud layers that do not appear natural during these moments. as well as the cloud shape is the makeup of the clouds. there are halos, zenith arcs, pillars and perihelions a lot of the time. and the \"iridescent\" clouds are so vivid!

years of sky watching, thousands of hours, a college degree in geology.  until now i have never seen anything in the sky that could not be explained as a natural, although sometimes unusual, event.\r\n\r\ni was out in my yard looking for meteors and relaxing when an object appeared from behind my roof.  it was in the sw sky about 15 -18 degrees above the horizon moving to the ese and caught my attention initially as an airplane with red, green and white lights over the trees.   it was far enough away  that the body of the craft was not discernible due to its bright lights and it was clearly high in the sky being visible over the trees at the back of my property. i glanced directly at it and immediately thought there was something very odd in that the lights were blurry, fuzzy looking. more like orbs than the lights of a plane.  there were stars clearly visible nearby that were pinpoints of light so it was just odd in the cloudless sky.  \r\n\r\nthe object was visible and moving west to se slowly for almost five seconds until it slowed quickly and then stopped completely.  my first thought was that the object was turning and only appeared to stop, but the lights, which were clearly separate colors, were not reorienting themselves as a turning airplane would certainly do.  the red and green light did not blink or change intensity.  the white light on the right (west) side of the object was pulsating, dimming and brightening, unlike an airplane with strobes that blink.  the object appeared to hover for about ten seconds with no other changes in the lights, ruling out a helicopter turning in a hover.  it then abruptly reversed its course back to the nw.  the way that it started moving was too abrupt for a turning airplane, it was almost like a computer animation in that it seemed to jump to its path with no curving motion and a very short period of acceleration followed the initial jump.  it then maintained a very steady, straight path in departing.  i was able to change position and watch the object for several minutes.  i attracted my wife's attention and she was able to see the object also while it departed nw and disappeared near the horizon.\r\n\r\nat no time did the orientation of the lights change as i would expect with an airplane. nor were the lights pinpoints as typical with airplanes.  these lights were diffuse orbs that were close enough to overlap.  the brightness of the orbs and dark sky did not allow a hint of the actual shape of the object to show.\r\n\r\ni have always been skeptical of stories told by others about lights in the sky because i had never seen anything that i felt was not \"explainable\" but this event has made me wonder just what i actually saw.  i think that it was definitely not a \"normal\" aircraft and was obviously a craft under intelligent control.  it was an \"unidentified\" object that i hope others will have reported and perhaps identified as a natural object, but it was not something that i have ever seen before.\r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

directly across from their house. we could see it the whole time from when we came around the curve. we got to their gravel road and pulled in i stopped and all 4 of us got out of the car. we stood

about 30 feet above us and my car. looking up i heard no noise and there was no wind coming off of it. the lights were bright but not overpowering. it was about 20 feet from point to point of the triangle. it had white lights on the corners and a red light in the center that was way less bright. it had what looked like metal ribs on the sides of it and it appeared to be only a couple of feet tall. it had weird looking symbols on the bottom, 3 of them. it moved slow. it kept moving until it flew across the road. it went over a cattle field up over another hill and went down over the other side.We watched it till it was out of sight. we jumped back into my car when the shock wore off and we were only about 200 feet from their house. we were all screaming what was that and freaking out. it seemed like it lasted a long time but it was only about 8 or 9 minutes from when we first saw it till it was out of sight. after that my car stereo never worked right again neither did the clock in my car. we told some people what we saw including my girlfriends aunt and uncle and everyone thought we were crazy, even though all 4 of us saw the exact same thing.","distance":"21-100

before i asked my mum what she thought it could be by this time we are both standing up looking out trying to work out what it is.Now 20 mins we've been watching the lights even more perplexed as to why if it was a plane it's not moved. and then the lights shoot up like a rocket so fast like i've never seen. but my mum seen it too so i know i wasn't crazy. still talkin about it we sit back down then notice the lights come back.They seem stiller but faster when they juggle. at this time i'm around 23 ish and my mum is a good 27 years older than me so we are not kids. i tell her i'm getting in the car and going to the water front where i will get a better view, so she comes with me leaving my dad on the sofa speechless thinking we are crazy but not bothering to look himself. 5 minute drive to the wirral side of the river mersey, so now we can see from the airport for about 10 miles maybe not sure. but we find the lights easy enough and seems they have been  hiding when a plane takes off or lands by hiding i mean shoots very high in the sky, then comes back down a minute or so later. some times the lights are close together and other times they split up a bit but nearly always in a triangle shape. the lights suddenly zoom to the other end of the skyline stay there for a few seconds and zoom back to close to the airport again they do this a few times like they are playing a game but move so fast it's like they just appear at one end then the other over a distance of about 10 miles very strange but each time they get back close to the airport they juggle about like they are communicating. contact/sight lost when lights zoomed straight up we waited for about 20 mins but nothing came back.This experience lasted over 1 hour ( pluss20 mins waiting) and was so weird we actually went home and put the news on thinking lots of people would of reported it but it wasn't even on the radio. i thought about calling the airport to see if they had any reports of ufos but clearly as we see at least 1 take off and 1 land they could not of been worried.No reports in local papers either so all left in

however, i believe it was'77 or'78 in early summer. this is very near to lake cachuma. very few if any other cars were on the road. i drove over a hill and saw the ufo to the right of center through my windshield. it was moving very slowly, several miles per hour only, and was about to begin crossing over the roadway.  i could clearly see the entire profile of the craft; could have hit with a slingshot. since i could not take my eyes off of it, i slowly eased my car to the dirt shoulder of the two-lane road. \r\n\r\ni got out of my car and could easily hear the whirring hum emanating from it. it is my belief that at this point, after i was standing still staring at it for maybe ten seconds, that it, or them, saw or detected me. at that point the whirring hum began to increase in volume while also beginning to pulsate. the vehicle began to move a little faster, and then, at the same time the noise it made reached a crescendo, it sped off unbelievably fast, almost in a blur,and went over a hilltop, at which point i could no longer see or hear it.\r\n\r\ni was driving to see friends in the san fernando valley for the weekend. i lived in morro bay. when i arrived at my friends we had an extended conversation about my experience, and theirs, late into the night. the most memorable aspects to the encounter were how close and perfectly clear it was, the otherworldly sound it made, and the phenomenal speed it attained on its exit from the area.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"101-500

one night i was sitting at the end of my drive way and i saw a light moving in a very crazy pattern. up and down and side to side but still staying in a general area. i watched this for about 3 min when it seemed to absorb in to itself and disappear. since then i have seen the same light 4 more times. doing the same thing each time. last night around 2 am i got into my boyfriends car to leave. i looked up and saw what looked like a strobe light in the air. it was dim, and looked kinda far. it also didn't have a set pattern the lights were going off. so we decided to drive towards it. when we reached the end of my neighborhood we saw the light. way clearer now and we saw that it was a flying object. it was moving very slow, and it passed directly over us. it was lower than a plane, but higher than the treetops. when it got directly over us we looked out from the car. the bottom of the craft was two red glowing circles. and that's flashing light we originally saw. the red lights reminded me of a stove burner. very red, but not shining. it looked almost like a triangle. when we started driving again and got on the main road we still saw the strobe looking light, i could no longer see the red lights. we watched the strobe light for about 4 more min until it disappeared altogether.
