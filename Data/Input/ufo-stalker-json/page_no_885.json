{5th amendment censored) the (blank) and (blank) buildings as well as several (blank) agencies with a clever (blank) i wrote that made it impossible for me to be detected by the (blank) and mj-12 attention. that being said, i have been abducted at least seven times that i am aware of since age 12 (possibly much younger) and i have an implant that is self aware enough to move away whenever i try to rip it out with something. every x-ray i have requested of my arm has mysteriously not made it into my hands as hard evidence despite multiple attempts at ordering said screenings at my local hospitals or my pcp and even my chiropractor agreed to zoom out one x-ray to reveal whats in my arm and when the pics came in the mail, they were all there accepts the one i has asked for and a double print was sent instead.\r\n\r\non the morning of november 27th i was visited by two men who looked nearly identical other than one had a gotee and one did not. neither of them had distinguishing facial features such as wrinkle or signs of aging or even expressions for the most part as well as being dressed i suits that look like they just came fresh from the drycleaner and pressed, immaculate beyond normal parameters. one referred to the other as e-e-7 at one point during our brief conversation. their behavior was peculiar in an eccentric way, like a bad black and white alien invasion film, just not quite human. they kind of pulled the good cop/bad cop cliché but the one without the gotee was clearly in charge and asked me several questions about my manuscript and the publishers that were interested in it as well as when or if i was planning to publish it. then the other came out of left field angrily (which was odd since they displayed no real emotions or normal body language of any type) and raising his voice said, \"it's not right to steal things from corporations!\" to which i responded, \"it is when corruption of such threatens the security of the american public.\" that's when the lead agent calmed his partner and then he showed me a penny, heads up, 1983 (my birth year coincidentally) and it disintegrated in his palm to ash and scattered to the wind and then he said, \"that could happen to your heart or your liver or a kidney mr. murphy. people get sick all the time with ailments that baffle modern doctors.\" i told him i was done with this conversation and he said \"we'll be seeing you real soon mr. murphy.\" and i quickly went inside. they had originally asked to come in to which i refused and lit a cigarette and told them i have children (who were at school) and didn't smoke inside. there was no way i was letting them in. i'd of ended up suicided like poor phil schneider. anyway, after i had gone in, i soon realized i was still smoking so i stepped back outside after all of maybe three seconds had elapsed and they were gone. i live on the second floor and you always hear the railway and staircase rattle with even the softest steps and these two men were no where to be seen like they vanished. the other thing is, i have company quite often, children and a fiancé and we are usually never out of the house and almost always have company or neighbors about. how did they know the exact moment to show up where it just happened that none of my usual busy home activities were going on and there were literally no witnesses to corroborate my story. peculiar indeed. i live in one of the trashiest, ghetto areas of my town where all the junkies, hookers and drugs are and this government plate black 1972 mercedes benz in cherry condition with tinted windows rolls down my alley one day while i'm smoking downstairs and stops for thirty seconds while i smoked and it was a rainy, muddy day and the alley is full of potholes and there was not a single blemish on that car. physically impossible right? so i'm smoking and looking at them stopped there through my peripheral trying not to look like i was looking and then they just pulled off. a car like that has no earthly business in my ghetto neighborhood and i watched it drive out the alley back to the main street so they weren't there for drugs or prostitutes, etc. since and before that incident, i and several neighbors of mine have noticed black unmarked suvs and other mercedes unblemished as always parked in strange places at all hours throughout the area. we also witnessed some very low flying black unmarked helicopters flying about as usual. as i reported twice before, we all saw many ufos and even photographed one and i made several mufon reports and was more or less ignored. i have just recently published the book of which these mib were so concerned about and plan to investigate the grand canyon and dulce, nm this late spring as i plan and plot my next book. i think it's about time that mufon took my case seriously and the agent assigned to interview me blew me off three times and i request that you reassign someone more seriously sincere to the mufon cause to my case as well as considering the facts that i have had seven known abductions, an implant, every symptom of abductee behavior, one threatening encounter with the 'ants' (hive minded hybrids of the draco-orion collectivists) and later on, threatened by the actually men in black of project delta. i have also made telepathic contact with a pleiadian named azhuril who i came to find out was my half sister by blood. she died in the andro-pleiadian war effort against the draco-orionite collectivists recently but not before revealing to me that i was a hybrid myself allowed live birth by my mother who was an abductee (who refuses to come to grips with reality) and that i am in fact 50% pleiadian and 50% homo sapien indigo which makes me an even larger threat to their agenda but they can't suicide me now. i'm published and any unusual death i were to suffer would blow up my book and to quote my favorite 1990's tv series, \"turn one man's quest into a crusade.\" the truth is out there and i stole some of it from them and their mad but they can't touch me now. my book says it all. i did not reveal all of my (blank) files in the book because azhuril had wished me to keep something bsck as collateral to ensure they won't kill me. i gave it to a secret friend we'll call mr. saintly and should anything happen to me, the information including video recording from within the dulce nm base itself will go viral on the internet. call it my life insurance policy. is mufon ready to take my situation seriously yet? because i have a lot to say and need only an ear to hear it. i believe that hangar 1 could benefit from what i have to offer so send an agent of mufon who is truly committed to the cause to interview me becsuse the guy you got in oregon is a little flaky and i have patiently waited since april to talk to you guys. i want to help as well. i want to become a field investigator. hell, i'm in college for anthropology already and i have been a ufo hunter forever. i must speak with someone who takes my case seriously and i must speak with them soon. please consider meeting with me in eugene or. if possible, i believe my case is worthy of a more 'ranking' or 'senior' member's attention so that my story doesn't continue to go untold. the content of my book does not discuss my abduction or contactee experiences, only my research and evidence so please come and interview me as soon as your earliest convenience. the future is changing soon and the world needs to know.","distance":"20 Feet or

that evening a number of us neighborhood kids - ages ranging approximately 6 to 11yrs - were out playing in the snow after dark.  it was a clear night and one or some of us happened to be looking up at the night sky.  this in itself was not unusual as the night sky there was and still is great for star gazing.  we (i don't recall who noticed it first, but myself included) noticed what we kids called a shooting star or satellite overhead moving in an east-west direction (east to west or west to ease i don't recall)across the night sky. the object appeared as a bright white star, roughly the same size and brightness as the more prominent stars in the sky.  because it traveled across the night sky with uniform speed and direction, we kids believed it to be a man-made satellite orbiting the earth, something which we had seen many times, and something which it may have been. we didn't think too much about it until, just as the first object was about to disappear from our sight over the horizon, a second object, identical to the first, appeared from the horizon in the general vicinity of the first, and moved across the sky in the opposite direction towards us. this second \"satellite\" moved across the sky much the same as the first, and, unusual as it seemed to see two satellites appear so close to each other, we still did not make too much of this as we assumed the objects to be man-made satellites. however, as the second star-like object approached its zenith it slowed down and stopped near a pair of \"stars\" directly overhead.  the three objects, bright white and approximately equal in intensity, together formed roughly an equilateral triangle and remained stationary for approximately two to three seconds.  then one of the points of the triangle moved slowly but deliberately counter-clockwise around the other two and then traveled off to the west, slowly at first and then very quickly, eventually disappearing on the horizon. as we were all interested in watching this third object until it disappeared, in hindsight we did not take notice of what happened to the other two objects that were still parked directly overhead (one of which in hindsight may have been in incidental star).  we amused ourselves for a short while over the event, but made little to no mention of it after that evening.  nor to my knowledge did we ever tell our parents or any other adult.  it wasn't until recent years i brought up the event as a childhood recollection.

at around same time.We had started our journey coming out of our estate in where we live in walls end newcastle upon tyne.We drove down broomfield avenue heading toward the coast road when i noticed a very bright star to my right.It looked a bit bigger than the other stars around but a lot brighter.We adjoined the coast road heading south toward the1058 which takes you to newcastle town centre.I looked at the star again and thought that looks as though it is moving.I asked my partner to have a look and if she thought it was moving too and she replied it's probably a helicopter or an aeroplane.We continued watching it as we travelled we merged onto the 1058 and could see that the star was actually heading the same way but also followed the same contours of the dual carriage way.We passed the junction at benfield road and noticed the star looked as though it was getting bigger.We were travelling at roughly 10 to 15mph having to stop for the other traffic in front of us as this road is usually very busy.We were approaching a set of speed cameras near the next junction to chilling ham road when the star stopped in mid air.We were both sure it was a helicopter as it resembled the same sort of movement as it hovered over the main road ahead.We were stationary behind traffic when the star started to get bigger,it then looked like a big white diamond with hazy edges.On each end i noticed lights faintly blinking.One was green on one side the other red like an aeroplane.It stayed there motionless as it seemed to be observing the traffic and surroundings.It then suddenly started to move heading back toward our direction which would of been north.I asked my partner to try and get a photo of it but she did not have her phone on.I said i've got mine try and get a picture of it.The traffic started to move again as i struggled to get my phone from my pocket.   the diamond came closer but looked to stay the same size  and then emerged to be an aeroplane which was around 2 to 5maybe hundred feet up. my partner couldn't get my video on my phone to work as i was saying get a photo come on quick before we move on.The aeroplane stopped motionless again,i was looking out of my screen and could only view the under belly of the craft and noticed it had about five dome shaped round lights which were quite big and never see on other aeroplanes.They were a creamy white and had a strange glow to them.The traffic started to move again and my partner never got the chance to take a photo as the craft started to move off slowly getting out of view as we had to speed up and carry on our way.My partner gave up trying to get a photo and said that she wasn't quick enough.I focused on the road ahead as she said that the aeroplane was still there in the distance.We arrived at work and talked to our work colleagues of what we had saw.  my partner said she thought it looked like a big red orange fire ball a total different opinion to what i saw which is very strange.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings, Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

pm\r\nsighting area: out of orion’s belt.\r\nsighting: 500-1000 feet above house. back yard. facing se.  \r\nlength: 10 sec.\r\ndegrees:  60.  \r\nsize: 2 “ hands length.\r\nweather: 60’s\r\nair traffic: minimal.\r\n\r\nsummary:  \r\na friend and i had attended a mufon meeting and dinner earlier in the day and had just finished a long distance call with a researcher ending the call between 7-8:00 pm.\r\nwe took chairs and blankets to the backyard and faced se with orion directly within our view. we were enjoying a late evening gazing at the stars. it was cool and in the 60’s with occasional air traffic which took 2 paths: south – north, & ne – sw. our local airport is w of his home. there were thin clouds which blew slowly over the houses, but most of the sky was crystal clear where we were focusing, except for directly over our heads which remained somewhat cloudy.  there are power lines beside his house which separate the houses at their high fence lines.\r\n\r\ni decided to follow a protocol used when desiring a sighting or contact. it is: intention/request/quiet/focus. my friend did this procedure with me. after approx. 5 minutes, focus was placed at orion’s belt off to the right of the top star, mintaka. at the same time, a comm began. like a rv, the entity (male-sensed as human/combination), clothed, at the panel, piloting this craft, came in clear & direct. tall, slender, more of the nordic type which have not been a main contact. the entity was a single pilot aboard what was seen (as in a rv) as a half circular type craft. he was sitting at the panel in the center of this half circular craft.  his face looked directly at me as if in a rv. he looked a little startled and then jolted me by saying: “oh…there you are. becky.” \r\n\r\ni asked my friend to focus in the same area to the right of the star, mintaka in the belt. within a few minutes, he said, “look.” i focused at the spot where he was pointing and we both began the close up sighting of this craft from different perspectives.  \r\n\r\nthe craft was observed at our se, above us and the power lines, at approx. 500-1000 feet above, at 60 degrees. i am not the best judge at distance, so this is an approx. with a given arms distance of an arm/2” w/index & little finger.  from my pov, it began revealing a wavy movement of space like a ship going through water.  this was familiar because i’ve seen this over my house before.  \r\n\r\n\r\nsequence of craft decloaking:  \r\n\r\nspace was pushed forward with lines. then, a gray, milky cloud. a form began to shape. color of pink/rose began to surround the craft lighting it’s form which was then seen as a crescent of a moon shape/boomerang type. at 3 points on this craft, there were large round bulbous like circles which could have been lights. the colors ranged from: white to gray into pink. before entering the cloud, the color of pink/rose lit up and diffused the craft so that i could not see detail only a general shape with the large, round bulbous circles. no comm during this 10 second sighting. no sound. no trail. it traveled in a straight path of e – w from my first observation point until it entered a thin, rounded cloud and disappeared. my pov angle of watching the craft float into the cloud had a type of shadow as if into the cloud & on the craft.\r\n\r\n\r\nfeelings/reactions:\r\n\r\nthis sighting was observed without apprehension. it was beautiful to watch the movement of space, the decloaking of a craft, trying to make out definition within a diffused form, the use of the colors (esp. the pink/rose), and a flight so smooth and steady it was almost ethereal. the physical sensation in the body was of a gentle 'gravitational wave' along with what felt like space & time slowing down.\r\n\r\nthe only startling moment was the comm with a pilot who was different from other entities experienced since childhood. he used my nick name which was used only in childhood. if the contact from orion’s belt was the actual craft and pilot who entered our air space, then that would indicate a quick transfer of space in a short time.  the only other occasion when this happened was in 2008 at 7:30 pm above my home. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

continued too drive east we discovered they were some kind of either ( tower ), or craft. as we got closer we realized it was way too high too be a tower, and was obviouslly not a star. it was dark, and the hwy we was on was heavily traveled, so we had some road glare from oncoming traffic, but the sky was clear and andover kansas is a small town, so visibility was great. at first it only had one visible light on the front which was ( white ), and large. as we neared it we realized it was in fact very large and quite obviouslly not a balloon or tower cause of its height. as we went under the object is when we noticed its ( shape ), which appeared too be triangular, and i would say about 100 feet accross. it was dark of course above us but based on perspective that would be my best guess. it started flashing red, blue, and occasionally green colors along its peremiter. mostly red and blue, was most dominate. while under the craft is when we saw its shape. we could tell its shape because along its perimeter was multiple ( white ), lights , which stayed on steadily.   as we went past it i could see a barage of white lights on its rear end which  ( blinked ), from left bottom corner too upper right hand cornerthen, left upper, then bottom right hand side. the object was quickly lost from my view shortly after that because of my driving my car away from it.  but i happened too notice another unusally bright object straight ahead and slightly ( up ), which blinked like a sate-lite does so thats what i thought it was, at first. the second object was roughly 20 miles ahead of the first object and was very high up above me when suddenly its lights went verrrry bright and for a second i swore their was a beam, but if their was it had to be very fast, but it shone brightly for about 2 seconds then, it went back too regular blinking. i remember thinking that if the second object was a satelite it shouldve went off my view. that when i realized it also was stationary, and very high up. i do know their is some unusual things going on out east of wichita ks, as my wife and i view them way too often, as too wheter their man made or not i dont know. but this particular object was about 600 feet high above us and right along a major highway, with heavy traffic, caught me off guard. but  i realized this was non-military with its multiple colored lights. i would be surprised if you didnt get a boat-load of reports o this sighting tonight.
