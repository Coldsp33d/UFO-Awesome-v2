i pulled up the video on my computer and put it on powerpoint so that i could magnify it and run it slowly. it took a few views before i decided to put it on the tv. when watching on the larger screen my grandmother and i discovered that at about 36 -37 seconds there are two lights emitted from the object going to the right very quickly you could miss is it if you are not watching carefully and closely. they are red then white. i hope and pray this is the proof i need to show that what has happened to me is no laughing matter and that i am telling the truth. please analyze this! i am also submitting a daytime photo so that you can see where we observed the objects through the trees looking out over the ocean.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":62645,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.95998256280964,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01152015-0016","longitude":-124.13693159926574,"occurred":1421202600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1421392555000,"summary":"Hovering lights over ocean","tags":["lights","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62645_submitter_file1__20150113182031.mp4","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62645_submitter_file2__20150115073911.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62645_submitter_file3__20150115074014.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"95519","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"McKinleyville, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:66721"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Camden","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My children (two age 7) and i observed several \"scrapes\" in the sky.  that is short, bright white lines extending a short distance upward high in the sky. if left by jet aircraft earlier they would dissipate but these remained unchanged and were bright white for the several minutes that we observed them. as we moved along the highway (going south on nj turnpike) approaching them we only noticed a slight change,indicating they were high and not very close. when we exited the turnpike at exit 4, and changed direction, we lost sight of them due to buildings in the way.\r\nplease note this phenomena is different than anything i have seen when watching ufos on youtube. there was no apparent movement and no real object, just bright white lines unlike anything i have ever seen before.\r\nwe were left with the feeling we saw something special but as open as i am to seeing ufos, i cannot say we did due to the lack of movement and no observable objects.

sidari, corfu, greece. at between 1800hrs and 1810hrs i observed a disc like object hovering with  bit of a wobble. i was standing on the balcony of our apartment on the third floor looking northeast toward albania, the mountains of which could easily be seen. the sun was reflecting off the craft which drew my attention. it was approximately a mile away at an angle of about 50° above the surface of the sea.  \r\nthe craft itself was disc shaped like two plates on top of one another with one inverted. however in between the two plates was a section divided into squares which would go around the circumference on the craft.  each square was then divided by two diagonal lines. i was entranced by the object being mad on aircraft since a boy. i knew it was exotic.\r\nmy wife was next to me talking to our neighbours a man, a lady and their teenage daughter. i wanted to get a better look and went to get my binoculars rather than drawing anyone's attention to it.  no one else mentioned it, i told the wife who looked who just my wife is a counsellor and can be very diplomatic.\r\nlater that evening while reading in bed late at night on my kindle, i was facing the double patio doors which our bed faced.  there was the sound of the door sliding open which was weird because it was the opposite side to where the handle was.  the curtain was then grabbed by very skinny arm with elongated fingers each with a short pointed fingernail at the end.  a head then appeared looking right at me with huge almond shaped eyes which were black with no eyelids, almost no nose and a slit for a mouth. the colour was grey\\brown and couldn't of been more than 4ft tall. it was a typical grey alien.\r\ni was freaked!  paralysed with fear as you can imagine.  eventually after some time i got the courage to look out the patio door.  nothing was out there and nothing unusual could be seen in the sky.  i went back to bed and eventually fell asleep.  in the morning i discussed this with the wife, who said i was probably dreaming, it was my birthday i had been drinking, one pint of local larger and one shot of 3star metaxa brandy. it is possible that it reacted with my diabetic medication.\r\ni've only told a few close friends and family. feeling i might be ridiculed.  i know my aircraft being a bit of a nerd and know it wasn't a mid identification.  a few weeks ago some kids had a drone in the local park with lights on and this event came to mind so i decided to report it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

home heading south along the coastal route on blythe road which runs through seaton sluice and takes you toward whitley bay links.It was a beautiful bright and clear sunny day the time was around 1.30 in the afternoon.  as we drove toward whitley bay links my partner suddenly said ,have you seen how low that aeroplane is coming over?As i looked i noticed that the aeroplane was not moving.She said its bloody low isn't it but didnt seem to notice that it wasn't moving which i couldn't understand. i said i can't believe it but it is the same aeroplane i had seen a month earlier with my father at exactly the same location.That event left me totally bewildered and wandering what had i witnessed.  i mentioned to my partner again it is not moving and this time i am going to pull over and stop for a better look.  i slowed down to practically a stand still when suddenly behind me out of nowhere a car was right behind us flashing it's headlights to be past us. i can't remember the car actually overtaking us or where it went from that moment.This is strange as the road is straight but bends to the left at the bottom taking you around toward whitley bay light house past the caravan park.  the aeroplane came from our right which is west and followed a straight path alternately stopping and moving on as we approached.The aeroplane moved at roughly walking pace passing over whitley bay cemetery and heading toward the light house.We came toward the bend and the aeroplane was right there in front of us bright blue and white lights flashing in sequence along the full length of both wings.As the aeroplane headed toward the light house it had practically came to a stand still in front of us.The plane looked like it was going to land in a near by field and came right down to practically ground level with lights still flashing out at sea toward the light house.I was in complete awe of what i was seeing as i was saying to my partner this is impossible for any kind of passenger aeroplane to do as we watched it hover at ground level.The aeroplane seemed to be signalling to something but i could not see anything around and then i thought to myself this is strange as there isn't anything around.I couldn't believe that no one else had seen this happening and that we were the only two people witnessing this event.  as we neared the plane toward the light house it seemed as though it new it was being observed and moved slowly off and stopping keeping ahead of us as we tried to get closer.  i remember looking and seeing what appeared to be a heat haze from the rear of the plane as it started to rise from ground level also i recall the plane seemed to have become a smaller version of what we had first witnessed a full sized thompson air craft with all the same colours. we reached the right hand bend running along whitley bay links and had to continue driving as the craft looked to be ready to move off toward the light house.There was no sound or roar of any engines nor any sign of any landing gear and any increase in speed.My partner does not recall the event as the way i seen it for myself and has a totally different recollection to me.We had our differences of what we had just seen  for the rest of our journey home.From the beginning of the sighting to the end seemed to last for 10 to 15mins all in slow motion i continue to question what we both saw on that day and have not yet got any answers for this account.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),

i always look at the skies and i saw a longish object with 3 bright lights one behind the other through the window. it hovered for about 10-15 minutes disappearing from view and reappearing before disappearing entirely. there was no street lights near it to be confused with and houses can't float so it wasn't house lights. when i realised it wasn't a street light i got out of bed and went to the window to take a better look . i was pretty sure of what it was right away. because i was a house guest i laid back down in bed quietly and tried to keep watching it but it disappeared and i went back to sleep. i only wish i had video of it. sorry. this is not the first time i have seen something like this.
