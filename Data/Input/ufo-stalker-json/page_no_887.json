States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On dec 21st 2012 around 1 am i witnessed what i call a halo moon. essentially what this looks like is a huge circle almost like a large lens in from of the moon. it's a very curious sight and occurs typically on full moons at or around 1 a.M.\r\n\r\nthat same year before this event i had a ufo encounter while flying with father to virginia. ever since i've been focused on the sky to find proof of the e.T. phenomena. \r\n\r\non oct 9th 2014 after looking at the night sky for many years i noticed the same halo moon. at 1 a.M. but this time i had my phone and took a picture. within the halo i noticed an object that i could not see with my eye's within the halo. the object was in orbit around the moon and threw my phones star walk app i made sure to determine during these times the celestial traffic so this would not be debunked. i also took multiple pictures from various angles to ensure this photo was not a reflection of moon light on my camera lens.\r\n\r\ni also for the first event woke my wife up at 1 a.M. to show her the object. it was invisible to the human eye but visible threw the camera which had a large range of visible spectrum allowing the hidden object to be visible to it. this object around the moon was by my estimation 30 miles long. it was an enormous size. having confirmed that the halo around the moon was somehow linked with this object i came to look for it every night.\r\n\r\njan 5th 2015 at 1 a.M. i witnessed the third halo moon and as soon as i saw it i rushed to get my camera to affirm the object previously witnessed was linked to this event. to my great surprise the object was exactly as it was before. as before it changed colors within the camera from silvery white to blue. it is clearly a solid object that is attempting to obscure itself from view. yet while this object didn't want to be seen by the general public it threw telepathic connection wanted me to be aware of it. i had from the sighting with my father and knowing beings of other worlds are real had allot of anger feeling different from other people knowing a profound truth amidst of world of people who are for the most part ignorant to it. the message sent essentially was they want to help and are here for those of the world who will positively interact with them. threw this telepathic link a great deal more information was provided this information gives a history of our planet which has been for sometime unknown and misunderstood. \r\n\r\nyou may witness this event to discover the truth of my statements and also witness a ufo. this ufo you will witness is large 30 miles long at minimum. it can be seen best during a full moon at 1 a.M. during what i call a halo moon. at this time you will witness what seems to be a large lens in front of the moon. if you then take your iphone and turn the camera towards the moon threw that lens you will see an object you can't see with your eyes. at the time of the last sighting the i used my star walk 2 app to affirm the locations of planets and satellites to ensure this would not be debunked as jupiter. also these objects are easily visible to the naked eye while this object is not. only threw a lens which allows a large field of light to be seen can you witness the object. the ufo is essentially from my telepathic understanding cloaked to avoid being seen. yet they wanted to be seen by the people who are paying attention or looking for the right reasons. this object is solid although it is cloaked and it is massive!!! i advise your ufo teams to try this out and see a 30 mile long ufo for yourselves to prove this to the world.\r\n\r\nhappy stargazing!!! \r\n\r\nphoto 1 shown is from oct 9th which i can prove the dates of them being captured. the halo isn't visible due to the darkness and the light of the moon but the ufo within it is.\r\n\r\nphoto 2 essentially shows the same object on jan 5th taken with the same camera under the exact same light conditions.\r\n\r\nremember this ufo is in orbit around the moon. also this light is invisible to the naked eye only via the camera does it show. it will also change colors when you view it. yet to be seen from earth so clearly means the object is insanely large. clearly not made on earth.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":62611,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.11356061823172,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01142015-0004","longitude":-80.75568687636054,"occurred":1388912400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

york\r\nnow i'm 45, and interviewed many people on this subject. i've had several encounters with flying disk craft.\r\ni'll give you the short version.  it was the summer of 1982 when i was in the car with my mom and aunt. a very clear blue sky day. we noticed a shiny, flashing disk in the sky.  it dove at the nose of a cessna airplane that was flying from east to west. the plane dove down then up trying to elude the flying disk in the sky. the saucer did the classic right angle turning associated with classic flying saucers.  it moved back and forth at high speed like a silver shinning giant dragon fly except more precisely.  the craft taunted the occupants in the plane.  we thought there was going to be a mid air collision.  this craft flew right up to the windshield of the plane.  again and again. it flew so close it was right at its nose by just perhaps even as close a  6 feet. it flew with such agility as to make the airplane look very modelish compared to a ferrari.  i knew then that people were telling the truth flying saucers did exist i told myself as i watched out the back window headed east towards the town of herkimer new york. my mom and aunt were too afraid to pull off to the side of the road to further observe the possible deadly air collision that i was sure was going to happen. i assume it never did. or did it?  the saucer was about twice the size as the little cessna.  there began my life long study of ufo government and aliens.  it took me many years to learn about what i had just witnessed. i now believe the craft was not alien.  but an alien reproduction vehicle.  i know a lot about flying saucers. as much as anyone not building them i suppose.  i wondered for many years of what the flashing of the saucer was for.  i know believe it was

head i convinced myself that what i saw was a spotlight from a nearby city. which was later proved to me it wasn't when i thought about it more clearly that there are no spotlights that strong so that it can \"follow\" us for that long. since then i just let this go but its still in the back of my mind what i saw (and my cousin who was terrified and just wanted to go home) and i want to know more. \r\n\r\ni'm only writing about this since i thought i might get some help from above top secret or mufon to see if anyone else have seen/heard of similar sighting anywhere else in the world, or even sweden where me and my girl cousin saw this. \r\n\r\ni've posted from where we both first spotted it to where we stopped looking for this thing (using maps app on my macintosh) \r\n\r\nfirst off we were driving home after being to the movies... it was sometime around 11 pm i recall. and i thought i saw something in the sky but then dismissed it as being light reflection in my own _.. then a few minutes later i see the same thing and this time i see a big light above the clouds... and it has 3-4 lights spinning around the bigger light. and it was moving back and forth (like a spot light) across the sky. then would disappear shortly and come back. \r\n\r\nmy cousin was just as shocked as she also told me she dismissed it first as reflection on the car windshield. she was actually pretty startled and kind of scared. we both tried to film this on our iphones but you couldn't manage to see anything because of the darkness and it was just above the clouds so you couldn't see it in the movie. \r\n\r\nat first later i heard about our monthly open night club being open that night so i thought they had a spotlight on or something...And that it was what we saw, so i dismissed the whole thing. then a few days later i actually thought of the whole distance i drove while seeing this thing and it possibly couldn't have been a spotlight anyhow. \r\n\r\nanyway. have you guys heard of such a ufo, especially around that time of year maybe in sweden or elsewhere in the world at that time, a ufo with round lights spinning around its \"bottom\" ? \r\n\r\n(where the purple pin is

toilet trip before retiring for the evening.Where i live has little light pollution and i often look up at the night sky as we have some fantastic clear evenings. as i opened my yard door which faces due south i immediately noticed a pulsating object in the night sky where there is normally not any aircraft or stars. it was high enough to be an aircraft but too low to be a star and at first i though it might be a helicopter. earlier that evening, approximately 3.5 hours, i heard a helicopter and saw a green light from the helicopter a few hundred feet up to my east. \r\n\r\ni am a surfer and very familiar with the layout of my local coastline and the flightpath both commercial, private and military aircraft take. this light was not in the part of the sky i would expect to see them. i could not hear any noise at all from the object which seemed to be at least 2 miles away. i kept watching waiting for the object to move but it stayed put. the longer i watched it, at this stage for 10 mins i was very surprised as it seemed to be pulsating and not anything i had seen before.\r\n\r\nout of interest and knowing it would afford me a better view of the object i went looking for my hd video camera which has a decent zoom function. i found it easily as my eldest child had been using it a few weeks back. unfortunately the battery had been drained. i went looking for a charging cable and found it, all the while certain the object would be gone. by the time i found the power cable and connected it to the camera, i would say 10mins had elapsed. \r\n\r\nto my surprise the object was still there but it had moved slightly west. i used an extension cable which i plugged into a nearby power socket and that started giving some power to the camera. frustratingly as i tried to zoom in on the object the camera kept dying, i think due to lack of power. i left it a few mins to charge and tried again.\r\n\r\nthankfully the cable power had sufficiently brought the camera back to life and i was able to zoom in on the object. i was shocked at the clarity of the image i saw. i was using a panasonic hc-v720, 20.4 megapixel, 28mm wide, x50 i.Zoom camera. i purchased it last year to take footage of a surf trip i made to the maldives. \r\n\r\ni started recording standing in the doorway of the yard door and took several minutes of footage. you can hear my wife in the background telling me to stop filming and come to bed. knowing i was seeing something unusual i kept filming before i had to adjust my position. the object was clearly moving into and out of sharp focus which suggested to me it was maintaining altitude but moving directly north and south.\r\n\r\ni took the extension cable out into the yard in my bare feet as i did not want to risk going in to put boots on for fear of missing the object. by this time it had moved west but at the same altitude. i started filming again and got another 6 mins of footage. i panned out twice i think to show the building next to mine and a nearby street light to try and give some perspective on distance and size of the object. to me it looked very large given the distance from me to it. \r\n\r\ni eventually got really cold as it was not much above freezing. i stopped filming and went to bed. i woke at 6am when it was still dark and went into the yard again but could not see the object. in hindsight i should have put some warm clothes on and continued filming.\r\n\r\nhaving watched the footage i took i can clearly see a distinct outline to the object which has a domed top, bulges in the middle and a dome below. it also very clearly has pulsating colours and lights at both its core and its outline. as a child i was a keen attender of air shows and since then see lots of aircraft in my area as it has a flight path to my nearest civilian airport. i am familiar with what civilian aircraft and military aircraft look like. this was not like anything i know of and made no noise. this shape and the objects behaviour puts it outside of any aircraft i am aware of and i would very much like to know if i was filming as star, planet, low earth orbit satellite etc. the more i watch the footage the more intrigued i am.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

sitting in my back yard gazing up at the stars.  the evening was quite cool and clear with some light wispy clouds at high altitude.  we were sitting quietly when my friend told me to focus on the area just west of orion's star mintaka.  within a few minutes a translucent type of cloud appeared just southwest of the southern star of orion's belt alnitak.  a moment later a craft appeared \"very clearly to me\" as a crescent shaped remarkably beautiful ship/craft (sketches attached).  my friend and i both observed the craft at about 60 degrees above the horizon move silently across the sky from east to west.  the total time of viewing was about 8 to 10 seconds, at an approximate 60 deg field from start to finish.  \r\nthe backyard viewing location is a cement slab with no trees to obscure our view.  orion's belt was clearly in view and we had been outside in the dark for over a half an hour so our eyes were well adjusted to the night.  \r\nthere were no acquisition lights on the craft, which is very odd since the flight path was due west toward the lakeland airport.  with the sighted craft approximately 500 to 1000 feet in altitude, this is quite dangerous as there might be other small aircraft at that altitude with a potential collision issue.  if this was a military craft it would have had some type of lights on it or if super secret it would not have flown this path.\r\nit appeared to me that the craft was illuminated from the urban city lights below therefore it must have been a shiny.  when the craft first appeared it was almost a translucent look, silver in color, but changed to a pale rose color before it disappeared.  the craft had a clearly defined shape and i could see some details on the underside.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

through valley forge park to and from work. i was driving nw on gulph rd towards phoenixville away from king of prussia, when i noticed three very bright lights just over the tree line in the distance (i think i noticed them just about the time i passed the washington memorial chapel). the lights were side by side. at first glance it looked to be an airplane of some sort. but as i drove closer i realized whatever it was, was too bright and too low to be a plane. i actually started to think that maybe they had built a tower in the park with lights at the top of it, but i knew that wasn’t logical because i would have seen this tower/monument by now. i also started to realize that whatever it was, wasn’t stationary. it was moving, but slowly. when i was finally back on a straight part of the road, i had decided that this was just too weird and started snapping pictures. as i got closer it was more apparent to me that this wasn’t a plane or a helicopter. i considered pulling over, but had someone behind me. it was also very dark and 17 degrees outside. but after my car had finally passed the lights (i couldn’t describe anything beyond that because of how bright the three lights were) i decided to look back at it out my driver side window. this is when i realized that it was literally just above the tree line and shaped like a triangle. once i was past the lights i could distinguish the shape vividly. \r\nafter my experience i was a little shaken up. i called my mom, who thought i was just pulling her leg. but after i sent her the pictures, she was convinced. she even went as far as to research sightings in valley forge. she came up with two interesting stories. one, was of george washington, who had reported witnessing a ufo in the now park. and a few years ago someone else had reported a very similar story to mine, which made me feel less crazy.  \r\ni have been living in the area for almost 5 years now, and i visit the park often. i know this park in and out. i know what the planes flying overhead look like. and i’ve seen my fair share of helicopters and drones. this to me was just so weird and unexplainable. it took me almost a week to even send in my story. i’m open-minded about unexplainable events, but i personally do not come to conclusions without thinking about it first. even if this was totally explainable, it was still weird and definitely a story worth sharing. \r\n","distance":"21-100

slight haze.\r\n\r\ninitially, these glittering orbs seemed clustered and then one on top of the other as they continued to descend. they changed color from white to blue. several others white orbs then either appeared in the distant sky above these, or i just noticed them, but counted at least three more stationary orbs. \r\n\r\nthere seemed to be some pulsating and gyrations going on in the closer objects. they then separated turning east and over the building causing me to exit through the front to get a better view as they were moving right over the central san fernando valley. i watched as these to objects positioned themselves adjacent to each other in a stationary formation with another stationary orb high above.\r\n\r\ni watched these closer two remain stationary in a bright blue color and hover for about another ten minutes when the southernmost blue object began to slowly ascend where it became obscured in very high wispy clouds.\r\n\r\nthe other object remained stationary for several minutes when it's color darkened to a dark lead gray. a round or typical saucer shape was detectable, although had i had a pair of binoculars available i'm certain that i could have been able to see details the view was so good.\r\n\r\nthis lone remaining lead colored disc shaped objects made slow maneuvered starts and stops heading north. it lingered long enough for me to
