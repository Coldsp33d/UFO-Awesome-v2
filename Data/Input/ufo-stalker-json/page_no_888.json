interest.\r\n   in, or about, 1962 in nyc, manhattan, mid-town, close to the hudson river, i had my first experiance. i was 4 years old at the time, but very sharp and understanding of such things, as ufos and alien abductions. why? because it seemed to be happening for generations of my family, which made it easier to communicate to my elders and other relatives. most of my relatives that lived at one time or other in the caribean, primarily puerto rico. puerto rico, which even today is a hot spot for ufo activities.\r\n   well, as i was saying. my story, for a lack of a better word, because story doesn't give the right tone, or feel.\r\n   i was 4 years old at home with my mother and baby brother in the living room, when a strange shape seemed to glance past our window. it was a window that displayed the hudson river area, where ships once docked, or were mored by the navy.\r\n   it was silver in color, rounded like a saucer shape, silent, but gave off a weird vibe to the body. i turned then to catch my mother's eye and attention, but by then she was leaving toward the bedroom with my baby brother. so, i decided to investigate via the front living room window were i first sighted the object. it had a fire-escape, which most nyc apartments did at the time, and followed it across and then up it went.\r\n   once i assured my mom that i was going to sit out on the fire-escape, i preceeded to go out. there is were it got scary for sure. instinctly i felt something weird happening to me, like a mental communication entering my mind, pulling out the window. it was then that i resisted, but curiousity got the best of me. so, i saw these two creatures climbing down towards me asking for my hand, and all i thought was \"no way\". believe it or not, it was mentally painful to resist. it terrofided me, and still does since then. yes, i did tell my mother and that's when she told me about her experiances, and that of her sisters and mother. it didn't seem to surprise her. it was as if she had been awaiting for one of us to one day tell her about our encounter.\r\n  since then, i've had numerous encounters, some more extrordinary than others.\r\n  one of the encounters that stand out more than any other was the experiance i had on fort dix, on january of 1978. there i was in the military, the u.S. army, as a [designation removed(1)/cms/tg] covering range exercises in the field for basic training units. \r\n  i was heading out to freedom ridge, an area used to simulate combat for the basic training companies. they, the soldiers, learned to perform in a field environment and live for a couple of days with their drill sergeants. we, the [designation removed(2)/cms/tg], covered the ranges in shift of two every 12 hours. i, along with another [designation removed(2)/cms/tg], were scheduled to cover the night shift, which was from  8 p.M. to 8 a.M. and we stayed in a modified single wide trailer, which also served as [designation removed(2)/cms/tg] station, in case there were any injuries we could treat them and get them back to garrison and the hospital ( ireland army hospital).\r\n  so, to get to this site we drove rountinely through texas ave, passing mcguire afb, then a left towards freedom ridge, which is where the incident occured. and before i go further, i must say that i saw a case finally on t.V. that showed this incident, and boy was i elated, because i had told just a limited number of people this, and i always felt as if i were looked at as being crazy. this episode had totally vindicated me and my story. my wife must have told me to shut up a million times there after, because i kept repeating it, because i was so happy it came out. \r\n  well, the article called it the fort dix/mcguire afb incident. so, here it goes. it was in january of 1978 about 7 p.M. and we, there other [designation removed(2)/cms/tg] and i, were preparing the supplies and food for the stay in the [designation removed(2)/cms/tg]al trailer, and we hit the road at about 7:15 to 7:30 p.M., and yes we were running late. we usaully left about a quarter after 6 p.M., but yes, we used to drive very fast,especially since, once off of texas ave. it was a straight shot to freedom ridge. on this day, we, i being the driver, turned left off of texas ave and to the road to freedom ridge, when an usually colored craft caught my eye on the left side of the road. i mentioned it to my friend, but he stated that he wasn't paying attention to the road. so, i continued the journey on. there is a check point that is approximately half way between texas ave and freedom ridge, and i hadn't got there yet, when i saw it.\r\n   it was colorful, bright,pulsating in a circular motion, very close to the ground, but not quite on it yet. i turned to \"s\", as i called my friend the [designation removed(2)/cms/tg], and asked if he seen that. he looked and i saw the terror on his face, which was accompanied with \" get the f#*+ out of here\". he out ranked me, but i had to check it out , i told him. he said \"no\". i was going to do what he said, but just then i saw multiple aliens running like crazies around the field, so i got out of the field ambulance, which is what we drove to the field, and decided to investigate, bull@#$% i thought it was the coolest @#$% i ever seen to that point. \"s\" was terrofide for sure. i mean to scare \"s\", it has to be extremely terrofying, because he was one tough dude. he was about 30 years old, muscular( muscles on his muscles), very macho, not to mention he was the pride of panama, but today, that night he was chicken little. by the way i was 20 years old and a private first class, he was a sergeant. so he had muscle and rank, yet he was cowaring in the corner of the passenger side of the field ambulance. he was reduced to a scared child like image, right before my eyes, which only convinced me that what i was seeing, was truly amazing.\r\n   so, i looked back at him one more time and asked if he'd come with me, which he said \"no\" and \"get your ass back in here now\". i didn't want to put our friendship and proffessional relationship in peral, so i did the one thing that wouldn't jepordize it, i pretended not to hear him :-)\r\n   then i entered the woods, following the creatures, and now a serious commotion developing in the woods, with what sounded like police lights, bull horns, and various frashlight devices. then a single creature/alien came across me and stared, and i stared. i heard a couple of shots in the field of woods and then i looked at the being again and felt a sorrow like feeling come over me , like a sadness or dispare. i then had a weird feeling over come me, then i was on the side of the field ambulance, where \"s\" was still seated, but differently, because now he wasn't slouch in the seat cowaring in the corner. he was upright, in a very proud demeanor, as he usually carried himself. i reached in and shook his shoulder and said \"what's up man\", but he replied \"get in, we got to go\". i asked him, \"what happened?\" he replied \"let's go\", so i got in and started driving toward freedom ridge, though for a while we both looked like robots, just sitting there stiff and quiet. then, as i was driving i saw the ship at a distance and civilian and military vehicles driving like mad men through the gates and up and down the same road i was on, accompanied by helicopters and trucks, but i kept driving, because smetie looked as though he was either going crap or cry or even both.\r\n   the next thing that happened during this crazy episode was the time we had arrived at the [designation removed(2)/cms/tg]al trailer. remember we had left sevenish (p.M.), yet we arrived at approximately 11 to 11:30 p.M., and boy was the first shift pissed. they were yelling how f#*+ we were for arriving late and that they weren't going to releave us early or at 8 a.M. the next morning, because of the tardiness. \"s\" and i looked at our watches, because there was no way we could've been late, whcih is why we were arguing back, until we realized that they were right. how, i don't know, but it was true, we were late by about 4 hours, yet it seemed like, at most, maybe a hour. freaky !!!!\r\n    once \"s\" and i settled in to the [designation removed(2)/cms/tg] trailer, i approached him to ask about what had happened and what's up with him, and he said \" shut up and go lay down i have the first watch, which i reply, respectfully, \"no\", you lay down, because quit frankly, he looked like @#$%. no sooner did his head hit the rack, when he fell to sleep.\r\n    i wanted to report it the next morning to the air force, or who ever gets the report, but when i asked \"s\" to back me and support me with my statement, he said \"no, leave that @#$% alone, that might be @#$% of the devil, and i'm not @#$%ing with it and you shouldn't either. you don't have much time in the army yet, so don't @#$% with that, leave it alone. i don't want to remember.\" in his defence, i must say, \"s\" was very superstitous, like most panamians are. he always talked about voodo, the devil, the black or evil eye, things like that. i know of that stuff, but i don't give it much thought, and i'm puerto rican. not all of us get freaked out abouot that stuff.\r\n     then strangely enough, i had seen a program about some guy off of cape fear in north carolina, fayetteville, talk about his experiance, and i must say, he was right on the money with the descriptions of both the alien and the ship, vehicle, craft, etc...  i saw it too. i don't know where and when he saw it , but i did too, numerous times. guess where? my back yard, and i'm not far from the cape fare river. i even had some landing marks on my back yard. i first seen it when we moved from cumberland county to bladen county, which is as country as it gets. that was in 2005 when we arrived and it lasted till 2008, and then it picked up again. once again, i was validated by someone's account. kool !!! so i can personally tell you, that man is not a flake, he's on it. \r\n     the hits keep coming around here. it used to be that it was a common occurance. sighting are, or, seem to be periodic in nature, but they happen. i'm not sure, but it may be associated with the near by air force base, which we have several around here, plus an airport, and a large military base , fort bragg.\r\n     oh, if you're wondering, i have contiously been experiancing ufos thoughout my life. it didn't stop in 1962, or between that and 1978, or even now. and my brothers have had similar experiances too. it's in the family.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

about 5:13 this morning, i woke up...And i heard it right away.\r\n\r\na deep, droning sound...More than just a hum...And with a “mechanical” quality to it.\r\n\r\ni listened to it for a couple minutes, then got up to go to\r\nthe bathroom...Giggled to myself, thinking i was just hearing my bladder rumble.\r\n\r\nno, that wasn't it...\r\n\r\ni could hear it in the bathroom...\r\n\r\nand all throughout the house !!\r\n\r\nafter leaving the loo, i went into every room, and looked out the windows, and up.\r\n\r\nbut the sky was very overcast, and i couldn't see anything.\r\n\r\nas much as i wanted to go outside and look, there was “something” that told me not to do so...This morning was not a cool time to do so...And i have to admit, the sound was a bit eerie.\r\n\r\nthe most intense aspect of it was not just the noise itself...But how it seemed to be...\r\n\r\nthe best way i can described it would be that it seemed to “encapsulate” our house...As if a bowl had been put over us, upside down.\r\n\r\nand yes, to me, this noise was loud...Quite a bit louder than the hum i regularly hear when i really listen.\r\n\r\nso i went back to bed, and lay still and listened.\r\n\r\nall the while this was happening, the cats were glued to me.\r\n\r\nnot freaking out and running around the house, but trying to stay as close to me as they could.\r\n\r\nand when i came back to bed, and lay on my right side, 3 of them lay on the top of my left side...3 more lay right next to me as close as they could get...And several more were on the dressers\r\n\r\nafter about 45 minutes more, it stopped...As if someone had flipped a switch.\r\n\r\nit didn't “fade away”...It was just suddenly gone.\r\n\r\nthe silence was very intense...Made the hairs on my arms and neck stand on end...\r\n\r\nseveral of the cats came slowly over to the bedroom window to look out...And yes, they looked up.\r\n\r\nand for the life of me, i could not get back to sleep.\r\n\r\nmy husband, troy, woke up to go to the bathroom around 8am, and i asked him if he had any weird dreams or such...He said no, but felt that the house was creepily quiet.\r\n\r\nand no, i did not wake him up during the noise...\r\n\r\ni had wanted to, but couldn't figure out how to do so without planting the suggestion of “hearing something weird” in his head...That would have affected his experience.\r\n\r\nso now i must investigate this, to see if anyone has reported such an experience to mufon and nuforc.\r\ni also emailed this to dinah lechner of florida mufon.\r\n\r\neverything i learn, i will write down, for my own records.\r\n*********","distance":"N/A","duration":"01:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":62564,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.568037774713755,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01112015-0011","longitude":-81.16897010704402,"occurred":1420982160000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1421012755000,"summary":"Audio

sightings include 1 in my car in our driveway where this being took on the color of the interior of my vehicle. the 2nd encounter was at the back of the house where this being was able to jump (we heard where it landed), from the ground to the next story deck then proceeded to the top of the house. stealth seemed to be it's objective and we are puzzled as to why we \"caught\" these beings quite accidentally. finally, \"we\" have witnessed what i describe as air craft of sorts. lots of them. 2 in particular have been witnessed by myself and in combination with other individuals. these are triangular in shape and huge and not moving, stationary over the house. i have some iphone video and a friend later did a sketch of what he saw. we are not ufo or alien hunters\r\nand have no desire to attract the attention of a bunch of nut case whack jobs. thank you very much. if your group is legit, i will be willing to speak with you, as what i have stated here is not all we have witnessed. the first entity/being i saw was featureless as if it was wearing a mask for fencing. it's whole body was the same color, all of it.The being was sitting in the front seat of my car. this was quite starling and magnificent. i am a \"lock\" freak.I lock everything up tight and even reported this to the local police as a break in to my vehicle but did not tell the police officer i saw an alien creature only that \"someone\" was in my car. i believe this location/general area is full of lots of unexplainable activity and your group may be interested in investigating. thank you.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":62560,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.17912775269392,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01112015-0007","longitude":-75.5225960175398,"occurred":1342422000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1420986690000,"summary":"We've

6, 2015 when i saw 2 pairs of bright red/orange round lights moving slowly from the north to the south from the woods approaching the highway.  the lights were solidly illuminated with no pulsation at all.  both sets of lights were the same distance apart, suggesting that they were on objects of the same size.  i thought they were helicopters at first, but there were no blinking lights anywhere.  as i approached where they were crossing the highway, i saw both pairs of lights stop at the same time, where they hovered for a few seconds.  then the light on the right (or the north side) raised up on both objects at the same time, and they started moving in the opposite direction (to the north) at the same time, staying the same distance apart from each other.  as i passed the point where they hovered and changed direction, i looked intently to see a shape of an aircraft, expecting to see a helicopter's shape.  i noticed that there was an outline connecting the lights, but nothing toward the left where there should have been.  that is when the third light came into view on each object and i could see the triangle outline.  the third light was a bit dimmer than the other two on each object.  there was cloud cover higher up, but the lights were bright enough that i could tell they were well below the clouds and were completely unobstructed.  once i saw the third light i immediately pulled over but the lights had disappeared over the treetops on the north side of the road by the time i came to a stop, which reaffirms that the objects were not very high up if they could not be seen after only a few seconds of moving slowly.  i could not hear anything when i got out of the car, and there was not much traffic to interfere with my ability to hear.  the first car did not pass for 5-10 seconds after i had gotten out of my car.\r\n\r\nvery shortly after first seeing them, i could tell how much bigger the lights were than would be expected on a traditional aircraft, and i could tell from the spacing that the object was very large, probably 70-100 feet on each side.  i had a feeling of wonder and was very moved in a way i had never experienced before.  another thing i thought was incredible was the fact that i read about an identical account back in march of 2014 only a couple miles from my experience.  in both cases, the lights came and returned to the north, which is also the general direction of the ravenna arsenal, a place i witnessed many training missions being flown from as i grew up living several miles to the south for 20 years.  we would see large military aircraft flying in formation over our house all the time.  this was definitely no traditional military or civilian aircraft.  nothing i have ever seen in the sky or on the land has made me feel the way this sighting did.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

visable, and before i could get it focused on my binoculars it had gone behind a street light,,only it did not appear out the other side. i searched the sky with my naked eye and the same thing no light or no sillouette. i went across the street and asked my neighbors sitting in their garage if they saw it and none there had. two houses down another neighbor said he had not seen them but the neighbor next door had told them of seeing a similar group of objects a week or two before. i have flown aircraft, i had majored in aircraft mechanics and lived very close to a major airport in
