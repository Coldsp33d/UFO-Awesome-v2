that was blinking i told him that it was not a star it was a helicopter at that point it was in far east distance between tree behind power lines.He then said no that is definitely not a helicopter we look for about 5 minutes and then he left and went to work i constantly look out of my back window and about 9 p.M. i looked outside my back door and i noticed that it had gotten closer to where it is somewhat over my neighbor's backyard shed i thought it was very very very odd so i went and grabbed my phone is took a picture i was very curious on why it has moved closer and why it was still blinking the way what as i originally thought it was a helicopter hey maybe it's an airplane but it hasn't really been moving so i took the picture and i blew it up as much as i could and it had this weird weird shape you could see the light. it and the shape that the picture right out as i blew it up what symbols a boomerang but then again you know it could be a different shape because i am only looking at it one engl it is not the first time we meeting in our area above our house has a lot of time we can't really look outside and look at the stars on certain nights and there's a beautiful fighting of stars every now and then we get a few things but this one really stood out and i had to get a picture to get a closer look at it is nine thirty three pm n this object has gotten a little closer than what it was at 9 p.M. so i am constantly is closely watching is such a thing pictures and figure this

both saw a red flash like a flare or tracer flash ahead of us.  it appeared to come from behind the house, cross the road/driveway and shoot up over the field then disappear as a tracer bullet would.  the flash appeared to travel east to west across our road and straight up over the fields to the east then disappeared.  we drove past the house and shined our lights into the fields north of our home.  we turned at the end of our road/drive and shined our lights behind the house to try to identify if someone was in the fields either north or west of the house. the end of the road is approximately 100 yards from the front door.  we parked in front of the house and went inside at approximately 7:48 pm edt.  my husband quickly brought the flash light back outside along with our dog.  at approx. 7:50 pm edt, he witnessed a large light above the sse horizon.  he called for me to come see and i went outside.  the solid orange yellow light was stationary and very bright, lighting up the clouds and horizon.  we watched this for 3-4 minutes.  i ran in for my coat and my husband reached into the truck for his binoculars.  when i returned outside approx. 1 minute later, the bright light was gone and what appeared to be a small craft that appeared to be a helicopter was traveling north from where the light had been.  my husband reported that when he turned back from getting his binoculars, the bright light was gone and a small craft with blinking lights like those of a helicopter was in the same area but traveling east, then eventually turning north.  the skies were mostly clear with very light high altitude cirrus clouds, temp was 5 degrees, and until the light appeared the skies appeared mostly clear with stars very visible in all directions. the object appeared to be cone shaped with a round top and appeared to be completely illuminated.

white light in the shape of a boomerang at the nose of the ball. the light proceeded at a good rate of speed, slowed down for a short period, then regained speed again. there are large trees in town so i lost sight of it after about 30 seconds. i went north down the street to see if i could continue to see the light but it was gone. the sky was clear and the stars were out. it is winter so the temp was approx. -25 degrees celcius. no wind. it was quiet and no other aircraft in area. the ball of light did not make a sound. the shape would be if you took a boomerang, turned it so that it was pointing north and the ball of light was behind the pointy part. the ball was bright and the boomerang part was lit but not as bright as the ball. i've seen shooting stars before and this was not that. i don't know what it was but it definitely affected me. i can't seem to get it out of my head. i wasn't nervous or scared during the sighting. i am more intrigued and would like to know what it

emerson mb/pembina nd border crossing.  i was pulled over and was about to get out of my truck to check the tires. i opened my door, stood on the step, i took one step down and suddenly had a strong/strange feeling to look up. i looked up, directly at a strange blue/white object with a curved halo(?). at first i thought it was a very slow moving comet, having never seen a comet before, let alone a slow moving comet, that was just what popped in my head. i stared at it for a few seconds and noticed a second object behind it (roughly 6 inches behind if i held a ruler at arms length). both objects were traveling the exact same speed, on the exact same path. i felt kind of sick in my stomach when i realized that i didn't know what this was. i then jumped back into my truck, went into my sleeper and grabbed my phone to take a video. my phone was on when i grabbed it, i jumped back out and ran to the front passenger side of my truck and somehow in that few seconds my phone shut off! it took about a minute to turn my phone back on and to start the video camera. as i waited for my phone and camera to load, the lead object's \"halo\" was growing and shrinking and appeared to be swirling. whenever it would make the swirling motion the actual object would black out. i don't mean fade out, i mean it appeared to smear out into a black cloud shape that was darker than the night/early morning sky, then it would \"smear\" back. my camera finally turned on and i started recording. the video is only 37 seconds long and there is only about 5 seconds of this object. if you are able to lighten the video, or somehow adjust it, you may be able to see more and in better detail. i cannot see the second, smaller, trailing object in the video. the object was very far away at this point, but was still pretty large in the sky, but not big or bright enough to get anymore video. the speed the objects were traveling was approx 1 foot in 5 seconds at a arms length ruler. i don't know if i heard any sound with the objects. i don't remember physically hearing anything, but i had a feeling like i was hearing a noise similar to rustling leaves, but that may have been adreneline,i don't know. i continued watching the object for a few more seconds, but then i had a very strong feeling of being alone and i suddenly felt very frightened and i couldn't get back in my truck fast enough. i jumped in, feeling very panicked and scared, i locked the door, and took off. as stated before, i wish to remain

looked like a fire in the sky at altitude that a hospital helicopter might fly.  i called to my daughter to watch with me.  we agreed to stay inside in case it was a craft on fire.  the object looked like two diamond shapes attached vertically, almost like an 8.  it was shining brightly, some flickering, 4 to 5 small, round red lights or orbs located on the left side of the object.  it was on a path from northeast to south and southwest.  i was very afraid of it.  the emitted light reflected on my neighbor's car. we did not hear a sound.  it moved approx. 5 mph over my house and going over the park.  i could not see a firm structure and the edges were wavy.  it seemed to be columnar.  as it came over our street my daughter and i agreed that we did not know what it was and we both called it a ufo.  we were very shocked and disturbed and sat together for a couple of hours, of all things, we watched ancient aliens on tv.  we did not call 911 or anyone.  i am relieved that it was not a burning, crashing object.  when it was over my property, i went to my south kitchen window and in a moment i could see it.  i could see the bright, fiery, glowing object and could not see the red lights.  it still seemed like a vertical column shape.  my window is small so i lost sight of it. this experience raised my blood pressure, and i keep reminding myself to breathe.  it is almost 4 am cst, and i won't be going to bed.  i am too shocked and if i am honest, too terrified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

heard what was occurring with an unknown object flying throughout the area.  i hadn't.  relative then stated since shortly after 9:00 p.M. over 143 witnesses had contacted the county sheriff's dept. reporting an unknown object flying very low and making no sound within the surrounding area.  relative then sent me pages from the county sheriff's webpage where i was able to read eyewitness reports and official responses.  \r\n\r\n15 to 20 minutes after the call my relative then stated police were reporting object flying low over a main building in town close to where i live. i went to the bathroom window giving me a line of sight view in the direction indicated.  i saw a low, large slow moving object with a single whitish/ blue light in the front and two same color lights in the back (one located on each side of the object).  they were not blinking.  there seemed to be a considerable distance between the two sides at the back and there appeared to be a \"raise\" at the point where the lights were connected.  the body of the object the lights were adhered to was dark to dark gray.  after about 30 seconds after seeing the object it turned slowly in a sw direction at which point i lost sight of it.  at the time i remember feeling odd about how something of that size was able to move that slowly at such a low altitude without stalling. and although that ended the duration of my sighting the object continued to be sighted and reported throughout the community to the local authorities by phone and police website for another 40 to 45 minutes. \r\n\r\nofficial responses continued to the ongoing multiple sightings being reported up through approximately 11:20 p.M. at which time the sheriff's department website was closed.  prior to this, county officials stated the local air guard couldn't pick the object up on radar because it was flying at a number of 81.0 and the radar was set at 121.6 to 123.4. further statements by officials included information indicating two jets had been dispatched from a nearby maryland military facility to investigate and that by checking with faa and local military (airguard / regional airports) the object was neither military or civilian.\r\n\r\nalthough my sighting occurred at approximately 10:35 p.M. the first reported sighting occurred at approximately 9 to 9:10 p.M. there were also numerous pictures sent to the website of the object.  although the lights match what i saw the darkened body in at least one of the pictures looks different.  this may be because i saw the object from it's left side and the picture appears to have been taken from below the object. \r\n\r\nthe incident was at the time of this writing over 48 hours ago and to my knowledge there has been no further information given to the community regarding it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

of fort smith, arkansas. it was a little before 7:30 pm in the evening and it was dark outside. the sky was clear.  \r\n\r\nas i was getting out of my car i heard a helicopter approaching from the distance.  since i live near the fort smith regional airport i am used to hearing aircraft and did not really think much of it at first.  however, as i was getting ready to walk toward my front door i glanced in the direction of the helicopter and noticed it was following (or escorting) three red lights.  the lights caught my attention because they did not look like anything i had ever seen flying in the area before.  \r\n\r\nthe three red lights were flying in perfect formation in the shape of an obtuse triangle. each of the three red lights appeared to be accompanied by a single much smaller red light.  the small lights were each directly behind the large light perhaps off slightly to left. the small lights did not become clearly visible until the large lights were much closer to my location. all together, there was a total of six red lights (3 large lights and 3 small lights).  \r\n\r\nat first, i thought the lights were attached to a much larger triangle shaped craft.  as the lights passed over my neighborhood a short distance north of my location, i looked to see if i could observe stars through the craft and i could.  therefore, i concluded that the lights were either three small independent craft flying in perfect formation or they were lights attached to a much larger transparent craft equipped with cloaking/stealth technology.  if it was a large cloaked triangle shaped craft it would have been about the size of a navy aircraft carrier or a bit larger.\r\n\r\nthe lights/craft traveled in a straight line from east to west at a moderate speed at a low altitude.  a helicopter traveled with the lights a short distance behind the last of the three lights a bit to left of the lights.  the helicopter was likely a military helicopter since the local airport is also home to a us air national guard base and the fort chaffee maneuver training center is only several miles from my house.  as the lights/craft passed by i could hear no sound coming from them.  the craft(s)were silent.  the only sound came from the helicopter traveling behind the lights.  \r\n\r\nit could have been my imagination, but it seemed as though there was a slight outline of a giant obtuse triangle shaped craft as the lights moved away from my location toward the lights of the city in the west.  the lights definitely moved as if they were attached to a large craft even though i could not see a larger craft directly. i am still unsure whether i saw three small craft or one very large triangle shaped craft equipped with stealth technology.  the lights and the helicopter eventually passed out of my field of vision behind the tree line as they traveled west in the direction of the fort smith regional airport and the air national guard base.  the entire sighting lasted less than two minutes.\r\n\r\ni concede that it is possible the lights could have been military drones, but the lights were constant and did not blink like normal aircraft lights.  i grew up in this area and i am used to seeing military aircraft flying around.  i have even seen the stealth bomber fly over my house traveling to the national guard base for the local air show. i know what military air craft look like and how they move.  the lights i observed did not seem to move like normal aircraft.  it is hard to explain, but there was just something different, almost otherworldly about them.  \r\n\r\nas the lights moved by my location i experienced the feeling of confusion more than anything else because i did not know what it was i was observing.  it was unlike anything i had ever seen

will be telling yall 2 p.O.V mine and my husbands. \r\ndate and times that this event happened, also this happened in the \"hood\" \r\n11-26-14 11:45pm - 11-27-14 12:15 am.\r\n me and my husband went out to the front yard by our trucks to smoke last cigarette and my husband wanted to wait til midnight to wish me happy birthday we didnt bring our phones with us because we weren't planning on taking long, it was around 11:45 pm and we were stargazing then as i was going to pass him lighter he says wtf is that i turn around and see \"it\" going through the top portion of the tree across the street and hovering about 20 ft. low and  it was going like 2mph over us and into my backyard and house. \r\n  here is my p.O.V.\r\nin my opinion it had a shape like ouija hand piece with 4 (ports/circles?) and something in the middle of it between the (ports?) \"it\" was some made of some sort of metal material\r\ni saw this from about 20-25 feet above me so i see the belly of this \"thing\". the trippy thing about this was it was cloaked or transparent, to me in my opinion \"it\" had a predators cloak/transparency not totally invisible like you can see some of it but it was kind of blurry like summers heat haze the main color to me was dull black/grey  with some bronzish like color not bright at all it had 4 (ports?) 2 on each side that color was reddish/orangish/yellowish very dim glow to it with a defined black trimming around ports and there was something in the middle of \"its' center in between the (ports?) \" it\" looked like it was made out of 1 sheet of metal there were no panels,rivets,sections,windows,fumes,smell  when i first saw this i couldn't believe my eyes or brain, me and my husband were frozen out of shock all we could do is rotate around. i wanted to run to the middle of street to see if it sees me but i couldn't move than i wanted to throw the lighter at it to see if it makes a sound or see what its reaction was but i was afraid that it would zap me or something.\r\nwe saw it go over us and behind my house and yard. my feelings to this was scared,nervous,curious,adrenaline, denial,reality shattered. \r\n   my husband did not want to be involed with this report so he gave me his p.O.V and his sketch \r\n    husband's p.O.V\r\n he was asking for a lighter when he heard some leafs fall across the street that's when he saw \"it\" creep up in the top portion of the tree it went through the trees top. his description of \"it\" \r\ncolor: flat black/grey,tan,reddish/orange\r\n my husband says he doesn't know if \"it\" itself was organic there were no smells or trails/vapors. in his opinion it had a moth like body with wings closed upside down. to him \"its\" transparency was like bee wing material i guess membraneish.\r\nhe felt excited, nervous, shocked. if it wasn't for him hearing the leafs fall i wonder if we would have noticed \"it\"\r\n after this happened i had told him to just draw it don't talk i wanted to make sure i wasn't delusional.  he drew his sketch i drew mine. it was so eerie. i knew we had saw something. as we were reflecting back at what happened we notice a lot of weird things.\r\n first we live in major city, 1 block away from busy street and concrete plant and in the hood there's always some sort of sound, about 10 seconds before this happened there was zero noise. no animal,traffic,environmental noise.\r\nthe street light or house lights didn't flicker or dim when this \"thing\" went over us the street light didn't illuminate \"it\"\r\n \"it\" didn't cast a shadow , it seemed to reflect light. it kind of seemed holographic. \"it\" was about 20 ft. above us it measurements were about 5-7 ft. long\r\n3-5 ft. wide and 1-3 ft. in height. we went out the next morning to see if anything happened to tree or street or house. nothing happened no broken/bent branches,burnt not 1 trace of anything birds still gather there. we have no idea of were it went after that we don't know if it went through my backyards trees or the houses behind us we just saw it go behind our house and yard.\r\n  that is so freaky was something in there? was there a purpose in being so low and slow? did \"it\" see us? both of our concept of reality is shattered my husband never once doubted himself of what he saw, im sometimes in denial but i know what i saw its just hard for me to accept what happened and my mind  permanently tattooed the event. how can this be ? will it come back? now i'm constantly looking at the trees and sky  idk if it will return. plz anybody have any info/experience plz share with me? heres our sketches my husband is the better artist.\r\n\r\n \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

and a waxing moon surrounded by a moonbow. towards the se, over the airport, near kirtland air force base, i noted 3 lights, small but appearing as dots, bigger than stars, the lowest 15 degrees, the other 2 about twice as high. all were round, glowing reddish orange. did not pay much attention at first as i have often seen planes taking off in that direction in the 17 years living at this address, and could not hear anything due to the noise of fireworks and gunfire.\r\n\r\nthe largest dot on the left (n of the others) curved in a path over albuquerque like many aircraft do when taking off. but i first noticed the color of the light was not like that of a plane and there were no running or blinking lights as it turned. it grew brighter and then to my amazement, rose straight up and disappeared -- not continuing w as aircraft normally do. the 2 others, which had not moved, simultaneously faded out.\r\n\r\ni've lived in nm virtually my whole life and have seen a lot of weird things in the sky, including high weather balloons glowing after sunset, but never anything that i couldn't explain before now.\r\n\r\nthe entire event only lasted a minute or two, but i spent much more time looking up afterwards in sheer wonder and joy. however, my delight was dashed a week later. last night, i found a fresh scoop mark on my left shin. it was an eighth of an inch in diameter, and about that far immediately to the left of scars left by several others. \r\n\r\nno memories of anything odd accompany these marks, but a wound has often appeared there at various times since i was about 8, and it feels like tissue has been removed at least down to the bone. they take a very long time to heal, much longer than other injuries. i'm sure this latest mark was not present when i showered two days previously, and i don't think it was there when i got up for some reason the night before at 3 am.\r\n\r\ni have no memory of banging my leg. and as i am on a blood thinner, even the tiniest scratch bleeds a lot. there were no traces of blood on the leg, my sheets, sock, or the thermal underwear i wear during the day this time of year. i have a strong feeling that its reappearance at this time is not coincidental.\r\n\r\ni have included a rendering of my observation of the sky (based on a daylight picture taken this summer), and also a shot of my shin taken just this morning. brightness and contrast have been altered on the latter to make the scars of previous scoops stand out more.\r\n\r\nhope this helps. thanks!\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

and some buddies were sitting in a car waiting for some friends to call us about a party that was going on later that night. there were no drugs and no alcohol consumed before the sighting or during. we started seeing flashing lights that looked almost like lighting and would light up the sky around us for maybe a couple miles. we tried getting a close look but everytime we drove closer the lights would dissapear. finally when we thought the object was gone, we started driving to go downtown and get something to eat. as we started driving in the opposite direction of the lights we realized that the same flashes we appearing in our rear view mirrors and they were getting closer. everytime we would turn in a different direction, the lights seemed to follow us until one of my friends said that they could be trying to make it so we didn't tell anybody what we saw. my friend sped up the car until the lights suddenly flashed in front of the vehicle very brightly cussing us all to yell and close our eyes. we all suddenly started feeling sick to our stomachs and we tried to call a ufo report line. after that we decided to go somewhere busy in town and we ended up sitting in the macdonalds parking lot talking about what had just happened. after about an hour we got a text from our buddy telling us that people were starting to come for a house party. we started driving, thinking the the situation was over and that it would bother us again until we got a bit out of town and suddenly 3 bright orbs appeared, 2 on one side of the vehicle and 1 on the other. they were about the size of a car except in a spherical shape. the pulsates large quantities of energy and bright light, so much so that  our phones all died and the car ignition started whirring in and out of life. the radio started playing static and our headlights started flickering. something tells me the orbs were taking energy from our electronics and putting it into their own power system. we sped up and were about to call 9-1-1 when all of a sudden they made a very loud supersonic boom and moved faster than anything i had ever seen up into the clouds and dissapeared. i'm not too sure what happened that night but regardless i was hoping the people who read through this before they submit it would possibly be able to email me at the address i gave and let me know if this is a common occurrence or if there are any other similar stories like this that i could ask someone or get more info about. thanks for your time.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500

apart.\r\n\r\nwhile using the new camera and looking into the night sky almost straight up. i saw one image with two luminous trapezium shapes with rounded corners moving slowly from north to south. the craft was about three fingers wide at an arm's length and the length of the craft was half as long as wide. a trapezium shape with quadric corners or rounded corners, one thus and one opposite (two wing shaped craft). it was unique, it was the first time i've ever seen this shapes or associated it with ufology . \r\n\r\nlater while reviewing my thoughts, the image i saw reminded me of the chrome grill of a bmw almost or close to the shape, a two trapezium shaped wing image. must look at the grill of a bmw to relate to what i saw. \r\n\r\nthe image was self illuminating as if the edge was lit up fluorescently while the area in between was less illuminating. the color was that of a very dim fluorescent bulb with a blue hue. i didn't question the validity of the object. i just knew it was one of a kind and it was physically there in the sky not projected. \r\n\r\nthree minutes later, 11:00pm, another craft exactly the same moved north to south across the sky, making 1 or 2 degree correction turn to the east. each pass of the craft lasted about 15 seconds. as it traveled the object got smaller until the distance was too far away to see.   there was no sound associated with the sightings. the fluidity and grace of the traveling crafts sent a rush through my body - wow is all i could think- what an experience. i'm in the salt lake valley's west side about 5600 west. the direction of the craft took them toward the south ends west side witch happenes to be where the nsa is located. the sighting and the nsa location make for interesting speculation of the event. could there be other organizations aware of the sighting event on august 19th 2014 at 10:57 and 11:00pm ? is there photographic evidence from the nsa of the night sky on that dark night ? i would love know if there is a possibility to obtain night sky images from the north to south pass of the objects from the nsa or the salt lake international airport radar. there's more than likely other people that witnessed the event somewere of the unique shape and lumination of the wing looking craft. i've looked everywere for anything similar to the shape and lumination and didn't find anything yet. look at the file and that's the image i came up with,it's one of a kind. \r\n\r\nnothing came out in the pictures, that's because i wasn't experienced with the camera or ready for the event.\r\n\r\ntwenty minutes later, my son and i were scanning the skies. in about the same location as the 10:57 and 11:00 pm sighting we saw a blinking or solid streaking light that went in 1 or 2 second intervals and that happened 5 or 6 times all in the same area not moving through the sky. the same blink or streak repeating in the same spot in the sky. (no sound) \r\n\r\nthe color was that of an incandescent light bulb. the size of the blink or streak was the same as a small meteor. \r\n\r\nit was all worth the skeeter bites we endured. \r\n\r\nwe live on the west side of the salt lake city valley in utah.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":62519,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.67266804035002,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01092015-0006","longitude":-112.03203020165992,"occurred":1408514400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Utah","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1420836499000,"summary":"Two craft 10:57 and 11:00pm trapizium shape wings with quadric corners like the grill of a bmw grill three fingers wide and two fingers long at arms lenght cloudless night","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62519_submitter_file1__UFOPaintImage932014c5degreeschangeb.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62519_submitter_file2__ufoimagea.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"84118","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":142,"locationName":"Kearns, Utah","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:67953"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":889}
