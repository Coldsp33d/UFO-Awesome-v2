because they still might be there.  it was about 6:30pm and dark outside. the sky was clear with no clouds. you could see the moon and the stars all brightly visible. she said she saw 3 orb-like ufos flying in a formation above and behind our block of houses. she said they were flying in a v formation and got her phone out to take a picture. when she looked up again to take a picture there were now only 2. she took several pictures of these objects. i went outside with her and had my phone ready to take pictures. i saw now only 1 ufo and it was a yellowish/orange circle or orb shape and was flying in a straight line parallel to my street going from right to left(north to south). it was hard to estimate it’s size or distance and it was silent. it seemed to be a couple hundred feet above the ground and i lost site of it as it travelled out of my path of vision and behind the neighbor’s house. i was able to take 3 photos of it. my first photo had the flash on and it was to the right of my house’s gabled roof. i quickly turned the flash off and took another photo of it and now it is seen to the left of my roofline. my 3rd photo i pressed the 2x zoom on my iphone 8 and took a closer shot of it as it was passing by my house. you can see the eave of the roof in the bottom right corner of photo. the 2nd photo of mine almost looks like 2 orbs are joining into one orb. the live burst photo option was enabled on both of our iphones so that in addition to the 6 photos we took, each photo has 3 seconds of playable video showing the ufos’ movement and flight trajectory. i have included 2 photos and videos with this report. i would be happy to discuss further with someone the additional photos and video footage as well. i hope your photo and video experts can figure out what we saw. my wife suggested maybe they were those asian candle lanterns that people light. i have never seen any lanterns in sky anywhere before nor have i ever seen any lights in the sky like the ones we saw. i googled the asian candle lanterns to see what they looked like and compared those images to ours. the lanterns did not look the way these ufos did. the ufos seemed to have an aura around them. these ufos were flying parallel to the ground and horizontally in what looked like a straight line and at a constant altitude and speed. i assume if they were lanterns they would have been ascending, which these ufos did not. you can clearly see on the video that they are flying sideways and not upward.","distance":"101-500

it's height was about 300 ft. we were stunned to see the immense size of the object; yet not scared, just in awe! the craft just hovered as if observing us. about 10 minutes later, the craft stared turning toward the south, began to pitch upwards and in an instant; was gone.\r\n\r\nthe captain asked if everyone was alright; to which we acknowledged yes. he then asked if we had all seen the craft. to which we said yes. suddenly, my radio squelched and i asked to captain if i could inform my superiors. he said no. that we should wait until we return to base and he would make the report. the tsgt who was driving tried to start the vehicle and once he turned the key, the engine came back to life.\r\n\r\nupon our arrival at base, we immediately went to key and codes so that the capt. and lt. could debrief and report. he ordered us to stay in the vehicle until he returned. upon his return, his face seemed white as snow. he told us that if we value our careers; that we never reveal or report what we saw to anyone....Ever. \r\n\r\nat the time of that event; i was a very young airman with a top secret clearance. i knew what he was saying. i am now 65 years old and am not bound by secrecy. i know what i saw. i still look at the sky and the clouds. there isn't a day that goes by i don't. i am hoping that the others who were with me that day, report this too. someone needs to know, we are not alone...\r\n\r\ni don't know where this craft came from, whether from outer space, or from another dimension or time...But i know it was real.\r\n\r\n \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:12:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":88430,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.5008936,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11292017-0016","longitude":-111.2740449,"occurred":71924400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Montana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1511972315000,"summary":"On return to base. vehicle engine stopped. radio inoperative. ufo craft came out of clouds, huge, silver, square rectangle shape at least 300 ft tall, hovering, turning slowly looks like mothership. we all saw, couldnt move. then craft turned, sped out.","tags":["ufo","light","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":1512094849060,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":11,"maxtempi":52,"maxvism":24,"maxvisi":15,"meantempm":6,"meantempi":42,"meanvism":18,"meanvisi":11,"mintempm":0,"mintempi":32,"minvism":2,"minvisi":1,"rain":false,"snow":true,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":11,"maxtempi":52,"maxvism":24,"maxvisi":15,"meantempm":6,"meantempi":42,"meanvism":18,"meanvisi":11,"mintempm":0,"mintempi":32,"minvism":2,"minvisi":1,"rain":false,"snow":true,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":16667,"locationName":"Great Falls, Montana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8219"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Windham","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My paramedic and myself(an emt) were on duty covering a youth sports game. we were stationed at the high school field when we noticed a trail going straight up. so thinking this is a very strange happening, i took some pictures. i didn't notice this when i first took the pictures in 2012, but i was showing someone the pictures last night and found this object that appears in quite a few of them. this, what ever it is, is never in the same place twice. what could it be??

disabled in chipping norton, oxfordshire, england, where my sister was still a resident pupil, allowed me to stay until i got myself sorted. one morning i woke up thinking of ufos. i hadn't looked at my ufo newspaper clipping collection for months. that day, i decided to do so…just to see if i could rekindle my interest. that day was october the 11th, 1973...Two days before the start of the yom kippur war...Something was in the air...\r\n\r\nafter lunch that day, i decided to stay behind in the family unit called grenfell rather than return to the school buildings to work in the library, to help a member of staff, ******, with the dish washing up. as i sat by the kitchen sink, drying the crockery and cutlery, i looked out of the window. it was a clear blue sky apart from a solitary white cloud in the bottom right corner of my visual field. suddenly in the top left corner of the sky, i saw what looked like a silvery flying disc, hurtling diagonally downwards towards the cloud. i called to my friend to quickly come over and look. she did and was astonished at what she saw. \"what on earth is it?\" she exclaimed.\r\n\"i don't know\", i replied, \"but it doesn't look like an aeroplane or bird, does it?\"\r\n\"no, what can it be?\"\r\n\"lets keep watching it. its heading down into the cloud and it will have to change direction if it is to avoid hitting the ground. wait and see what it does when it comes out the other side of the cloud, then we can decide if it's a plane because it will turn and we may be able to see it's wings.\" the flying object entered the cloud...But no matter how long we waited, we didn't see it emerge out the other side as it should if it was a conventional terrestrial aircraft. my friend and i were left none the wiser. several days later, i was telling someone about this strange aerial object and sylvia walked pass and i called her over, \"hey ******, you remember that thing we saw the other day?\"\r\n\"oh, you mean the flying saucer?\" she replied. i was amazed to hear her so matter-of-factly describe it as such. my friend was a no-nonsense mature spinster, a devout christian, not prone to flights of fancy, not overly imaginative, not interested in sci-fi as i am. what impressed me was the fact that i would not have so liberally called it a flying saucer, which, many of my friends would say, was uncharacteristic of me, even though that was what the object looked like...And yet this rational sensible older woman had no qualms, no problem with speaking candidly of what she saw.\r\n\r\nthe day my friend and i saw the \"flying saucer\" turned out to be the day of a worldwide ufo flap, especially in the united states. that evening, we turned on the television and on a children's news programme, \"john craven's news round\", came numerous reports of ufos being sighted. for me, that was confirmation that my friend and i were privy to an extraordinary phenomena which had paranormal implications. the fact that i woke up thinking of ufos, then witnessing one with another person at midday, finally hearing that in the evening that thousands of other people had seen similar objects that day. yes, something cosmic was definitely happening and it seemed to synchronize with the arab-israeli conflict. were ets coming to watch the war?

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\r\n\r\n the night of february 26th, 27th early am i was staying at the best western in big bear.  at approximately 12:35 am i walked to my car alone to retrieve my luggage.  it had been snowing and was extremely dark, my car was facing a country road.  when i hit the unlock button on my car, the parking and interior lights came on.  this allowed me to see two eyes reflecting in the middle of the road, about 10-15 ft from me.  at first, i thought it was a deer, i have lived in colorado and i'm accustomed to seeing wildlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n  i instantly stopped and remained still as i didn't want to scare off the what i thought was a deer.  as my eyes glanced downwards, i noticed it wasn't a deer, it looked like a white, hairless naked man on all fours.  it was at least four feet in height, on all fours.  probably around 15 ft if it stood up.  there was a brief moment as our eyes made contact.  it then, as quickly as i have ever seen any animal, turned around, ran as fast as a cheetah away from me and then, straight up a tree.  i was frozen in disbelief.  i said out loud to myself, \"you have to be flipping kidding me\".  just as i was going to convince myself that this couldn't possibly be happening, it leapt from tree top to tree top and i could see it's full outline as it did so. \r\n\r\n\r\ni've never heard of such a creature but, i have found some other videos and pictures on line that look exactly like what i saw.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthe speed and strength it had is like nothing i've ever heard of before.  the creature was definitely solid, it appeared as if it was coming toward me, possibly hunting me?  i don't know what stopped it.  was it the lights that went on?  it had no visible genitalia.  it had a very human like qualities.  \r\n\r\n\r\nfirst, it was a new moon and i believe it was an eclipse that day as well.  there was a creek across the street.  i don't know if this has anything to do with my experience but, i was also a day from menstruating.\r\n\r\n\r\nif this had been a huge eyed gray alien, it would have made more sense, i've heard of those but, this was unlike anything i've ever been familiar with.\r\n\r\n\r\nnone of this makes sense to me, the speed, agility of the creature and there shouldn't be anyway that the treetops should have been able to hold the weight of the creature.  it appeared to be flashing like a tv going in  and out of reception as it sprinted up the tree.  it also didn't appear to disrupt the foliage as it did so.  \r\n\r\n\r\ni immediately called my father after i rushed back into my hotel room.  my son was asleep and i was understandable in a state of shock.  at this time, no one knew what hotel i was staying in.  as i was crying on the phone to my father, the hotel phone rang.  i answered it and it was only dial tone.  then, there was a knock at the hotel room door.  once again, no one was there.  \r\n\r\nat this point, my son woke up due to the commotion.  i told him it was a scary dream.  i gave my father the hotel information and he advised me to go wait in the lobby with my son.  as we were leaving, there was another knock but, it was at the back sliding glass door that went out to a privately fenced in patio.  \r\n\r\n\r\nthis was a one time encounter and it's unfortunate that i still live in fear of this experience.  i was raised christian, this humanoid doesn't fit into any category in which i am familiar.  i don't know why this happened and what i'm supposed to learn from it.  in addition, the hotel phone number, i found out later, has six 6's in a row.  i don't know if that has anything to do with what happened.  i was always taught that demons can't have a physical body unless it's possessing someone.  i can't imagine it flying a space craft due to it's primal manner.  is it a trans dimensional being?  nephellim?  what was it going to do?  is it going to come after me again?  why didn't it do what it was set out to do?  \r\n\r\n\r\nmy previous beliefs on the world and the way things work has been tossed upside down.  while it's thought provoking, it's been very traumatic and has me in a panicked state that's distracting and mostly negative.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

in colorado springs smoking a cigarette and observing the stars.  he was looking east over pikes peak when he noticed a bright star that caught his attention because it briefly pulsated or twinkled suddenly. he also observed a star next to it and he was trying to figure out if the first star he saw was moving. it started to slowly rise and move to the right separating from the stationary star. at this point he realized it was some sort of a plane or so he thought. as it got closer to the house he realized that there were no standard airplane or helicopter strobe lights which we are used to seeing overhead since we live near the airport and many military bases. when it was almost overhead he quickly ran into the house to get me at which point i got up and ran out to the front with him because he made it seem urgent. when i got outside and looked up into the sky i saw this very bright white light that was much brighter than any star plane or other lights in the sky and it was moving from east to west. it did appear to slightly change directions at times but not drastically. i also observed it pulsate a few times but it was not constant and the pulses were close together. after no more than a minute of observing and filming this strange light it then began to dim until suddenly it vanished from site.  we are very used to seeing the different kinds of planes, helicopters, both commercial and military flying over our home. this was much different than any other light we have seen in the sky. the footage that i captured does not do the brightness of this thing justice. all i can say is pay attention that you cannot see any of the bright colorado stars nor any other planes that were overhead during the sighting and you will notice i even mentioned the other planes in the sky and pointed the camera at them, but you can't see them because their lights were too dim for my camera to pick up. strange

about two hundred yards away and three hundred feet in altitude. i watched it go into warp speed in a nano second.","distance":"20 Feet or

because of previous experiences. the sky was clear and there was no noticeable breeze. at 8:40pm i noticed one orange orb at first and then another one heading in my direction and i was excited.\r\n\r\ni was facing the east and the orbs were coming from my left hand side, the northeast and slowly moving about 25 to 40mph towards the southwest to my right hand side. they were glowing orange and the size of small beach balls at about 200 to 300 foot altitude.\r\n \r\ni started video taping the two orbs when i noticed a 3rd orb and then a 4th coming from the same direction. i watched/videotaped the first two orbs separated by 50 feet or so fly by me and then switched to the 3rd and 4th orbs which were 150 feet or so behind the first two. then i looked to my right for the first two orbs and they were nowhere to be seen. i wondered where they went because i should have still been able to see them as they were moving slow and no houses or trees were obstructing  my vision.\r\n \r\ni then focused on the 3rd and 4th orb when i noticed a 5th and 6th coming from the northeast but i kept watching the 3rd and 4th to see if they would vanish like the first two. when they flew past and got about 600 feet past my position they started to power down and dim like a light bulb on a dimmer switch until they were nowhere to be seen. they just disappeared and vanished which took about 5 seconds.\r\n\r\ni had the camera set to autofocus and it was hard to focus the camera when zooming in for close-ups but i did manage to finally get some half decent video near the end of this sighting. i took some pictures but they came out blurry.\r\nafter the 5th and 6th flew by and disappeared before my eyes there was about a 1 minute lull in the action. i stood there for that minute happy, excited, some what stunned and thank full for what i was shown and witnessed.\r\nnow, thinking the show was over, like an encore comes a few more, then a few more until i witnessed a total of about 10 to 15 orbs. i lost count. all the orbs faded out at the same spot in the sky at different times when each one individually reached that area. they were all silent. the only sounds i heard was a neighbors dog barking and some vehicle traffic from 800 feet away.\r\nthe sighting lasted for about 7 to 8 minutes.\r\nthey stayed at one constant elevation and did not ascend like chinese lanterns would have and there was no wind at ground level.","distance":"101-500

event took place at approximately 10:14 pm on september 21st, 2017. i was driving home from my volleyball practice on a rural road called \"happelter heide\" near the village of brüggen (postal code 41379) in germany. i was listening to music, and my driving speed was approximately 100 km/h. when i was randomly looking outside my left window, i noticed a bright light in the sky (for the exact location, please refer to the map i uploaded as picture). i was immediately wondering what this light could be. it was significantly bigger than a star, but just a bit smaller than the moon. i could not see any structural components of the flying object, all i could see was a very bright, white light that seemed to be triangular in shape (could have been three lights in the corners of a triangle that were so bright that it looked like one big light). as mentioned, the light was white in color, even though there was a very very subtle colorful pulsating shine in it. it reminded me of a very subtle nacre-effect. the object did not have any kind of emission. i was really stunned for one moment because this object seemed to be so strange and remarkable that it made my brain stop working for a second. i had a look on the street again, to make sure, i'm not going offroad while watching the object. when i looked back at the object, i noticed that it was flying on a 9 o'clock position from me. it seemed to have the exact same speed than i did (still around 100 km/h). it gave me the impression that this object is observing me, as it completely matched pace with me, and flew exactly at 90 degrees left from my driving direction. in terms of altitude, i can only say, it was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon (definitely lower than 45 degrees). it did not increase or decline altitude. it was very hard for me to identify the actual altitude and size of the object. either it was really far away and quite big, or rather near and smaller. due to it not changing position relative to me, the perspective really didn't allow to make assumptions on distance from me and its actual size. the motion was steady and smooth, as i said, it was going exactly as fast as i did. i could not hear any sounds, which might have been because i was inside the car and listening to music. the ufo did not land. no entities have been seen. while i saw the object, i felt amazed and shocked at the same time. as mentioned before, for a short moment, i really kind of froze, and was not able to do anything than look at this object. overall, i would describe the experience as exciting. around 10 seconds after i saw the object for the very first time, it disappeared behind the trees of a small forest that lies next to the road (see map for more details). i tried to check for the object several times after that, but i could not see it anymore. my first thought about this object was, that it could have been a drone. however, some reasons make me doubtful about that. first of all, why would someone use a drone in pure darkness above a large corn field? secondly, the lights just seemed to be too bright, to be part of a drone. though i cannot remember that the lights really lightened up the area, the seemed to be almost a bit blinding (like a very strong floodlight beam taht you look into directly). thirdly, the movement of the object is making me feel doubtful. sure, there are drones that can fly much faster than 100 km/h, but also the smoothness and steadiness and the exact pace of the motion felt kind of unreal. \r\ntherefore, i decided to file a report about this sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:25","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

the phone and noticed a strange object flying towards me but west of my house going north. it was two circles connected together with a pulsing light, it was black and not reflecting light.  the motion of this was bizarre, flying forward, but also the bottom circle swinging like a pendulum.\r\n \r\n  he is a science student at a university so i began to describe this to him, stupified as the bottom circle would swing from the 8 o'clock position to the 4 o'clock position while flying from the south to the north . first it was lower and i thought it might be a drone, but i realized as it came closer how fast it was going and the size and it was not reflecting the sunlight but had a light pulsing.  the circles looked solid and were dark in color, matte.  \r\n\r\nthe object was in my sight for at least 2-3 minutes and then just vanished.  there were no clouds, blue sky, clear day.  i was so speechless i called my dad who is retired air force to ask what that was, too low for a satellite, and did not reflect the western sun.  he had no idea what could fly forward but swing like a pendulum at the same time.  \r\n\r\nhe suggested maybe nasa was flying something new.    i was completely dumbfounded by this experience.   it was not a normal aircraft, not a weather balloon, not a regular aircraft.   when it just zapped out of sight, i really wanted to find out what it could be?\r\n\r\nmy son had no idea what it was as i described it to him, then got off the phone to call my dad.  i knew my cell phone camera would not be able to capture it clearly, and i did not want to take my eyes off of this. \r\n\r\ni am a highly educated person, 2 master's degrees, and not prone to mis-identifying things, and i am telling you this was not normal.
