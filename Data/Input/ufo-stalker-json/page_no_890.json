city, ca. i noticed a strange octagonal shapeded object moving very slowly, around 11-15 mph above the roofs of the houses on the left side of the street. i was stunned, as i had never seen this before and thought it might be a helicopter, or a new aircraft, but as i stopped the car and rolled the window down to get a better look, it was neither one of these, and no propellers or wings.There was no sound at all. it just moved very very slowly, almost hovering, which was weird to me because i knew our aircrafts do not move that slow in a straight path. marsh air force base is several miles away, and i also took that into consideration. the shape was strange to me. i counted the points of the shape, which was eight. it was dark out, but there were lights surrounding the craft in white, yellow red and orange. the lights did not project from the craft to the street or houses, but seemed to be stationary and quite bright . the craft looked like a kind of high tech toy like legos, but smooth all around and dark gray or black.\r\ni started to move my car to leave, but was too curious about this, and turned my car around a half block down and went back to the location to get another look, and within seconds, the craft was already gone. the experience left me startled, and emotional. i have a yearning to share with people but i know they are skeptical. i am open to the possibilities because i have followed mufon for years and watch the history chanel. my husband had an experience as a teenager when he saw a ball of light that came very close to him in the late 1970's, hovered for about a minute 20 feet away, and then completely disappeared. he lived in anaheim hills, ca. it happened around 9 pm and at that time the area was fairly rural with new housing developments happening. he was sitting on the curb and he had never forgotten about that and the brightest light ball he's ever seen. still unexplainable.","distance":"21-100

german shepard, and a beagle. almost as soon as i turned the television on, the dogs jumped up, and took off toward the front door. i had never heard them to be so excited. they were  snarling, and barking like the devil was at the door. naturally i i got up, and followed them. when i got out of the door they were standing there stone silent, and looking up. when i looked up, and i couldn't miss it there was a bright orange disc. one thing that made me jump up, and follow the dogs was that as they ran toward the door i heard a \"whoosh\" go over across the top of the house. it was just the sound of air moving, and that startled me because i figured that if it was a plane crossing above the house that i should have heard some engine noise. since i didn't, i wanted to see what was going on. now, i was outside, and there it was hanging silently in the air, at a height of 100 to 150ft. at the end of my driveway. the first thing that i did was to get out my monolux telescope. then i called my uncle on the phone who works for the f.B.I. to ask him if he had heard anything unusual. he told me that he also had heard the thing come over; but because of the trees around his house he didn't see it. that's when i told him to come over because it was hovering at the end of the driveway. the disc itself was probably between 60 to 80ft. in diameter. it had a bright orange glow, and an electric blue halo around it. i say electric blue because i had a neon sign transformer that i played with that produced the same blue color in it's arc. the thing was too bright to comfortably watch through the telescope; but when my aunt , and uncle got there, my mom made coffee for everybody, and we sat on the steps and watched it. i ran out to a position directly under it, and i noticed five dark spots in the arrangement of a pentagram around it's center. i don't know what the spots were; but they were the only break in it its' otherwise brilliant surface. personally, i don't know why people are frightened by seeing ships or visitors form another world. i found it to be a fascinating experience. after about forty five minutes, as i watched it from below, it shot skyward, and in less than two seconds it was gone. i asked my uncle if he thought that we should report the sighting, and he said no. now that i am dying i want to report it so that other people will know that we are not alone in the universe.","distance":"101-500

lights moving across the sky, i first thought it was an aircraft and the branches of the trees were breaking up my view of it.  as we topped the hill and the trees were no longer covering the sky we both were frozen in our tracks to witness what we were seeing.  the lights (6 of them) were slowly turning on and off in a sequence, one after the other from right to left but the timing was so that one would be starting to glow as the last one was still fading away.  first instinct told us this must be an aircraft and the atmosphere was playing tricks on our eyes. until the sequence started again, from the beginning all the way to the right. at this point i could make out that these lights were on a large mass, which was very dark but seemed to be reflecting some starlight on its top surface (allowing me to make out the vague shape).  the object appeared to be several miles away and was well over 500 ft in width. after several sequences the lights stopped and i could still make out the silhouette of the mass, but it seemed to fade away or just left, it was hard to make out.  \r\ni will say that the area in which it was seen was over a military base that we live near but we have never seen any aircraft of any kind except the occasional helicopter.  whatever this was, it was large, the lights seemed to be signaling something, and it made no sound.\r\nmy wife and i were

saw a 15 foot round ball of fire on a hill at night during a rain storm 150 yards from where i saw sleeping, went out to investigate the spot where i saw the fire ball the morning and saw an impression in the gravel/dirt, the location was an old gold mine in northern ca. 25 years had passed and i had an alien chip implant self-extract from by back, it was a small blackish/brown roundish 1/8\" ovoid hard as a rock ball with white veins, just like dr leir had filmed and reported. 6 months later i found 2 steel studs on the top of my head that are still there. about 1 year later i woke up with dried blood behind my left ear, 3 months later i found 4 small alien chips in my outer edge of my left ear lobe that are still there. every 2 weeks for the past 2 years i have my left ear go bizerk with what sounds like a machine is downloading info from me with all kinds of radio signal sounds. 8 months ago i was sleeping and was woken up around 2 am by a warm round bright beam of light was scanning over my body and i could not move but felt no danger and kind of a peaceful feeling, 5 weeks ago the same thing happened. 3 weeks ago i woke in the night to go to the bathroom and i saw a 3 finger glow in the dark hand print on the door frame to the bathroom, the left hand print hand had two 5\" long fingers with bulbous finger tips and 1 fat long thumb, the 2 long fingers were bright red glow in the dark with orange veins and the thumb was glow in the dark orange with red veins, i turned on the light to see it and it disappeared then turn off the light and sure enough it was there, i starred at it for about 15 minutes and the next day it was gone, too hard to photograph. several times the door to the outside is found open in the morning with no explanation. i am sure more

probably around 1 am and i couldn't have been asleep more than a couple minutes when i woke up and i was paralyzed or something.  i couldn't move my body at all and i remember this happening to me when i was 19 at my grandmothers house. on that occasion i got very scared and it felt like there was something watching me or something. then i heard someone whisper my name loudly. it sounded like it was coming from inside and outside my head. it said \"cody\" which is my nickname from birth. that is the name most people know me by. anyway back to the latest incident. like i was saying i remembered this feeling and i didn't like it. i began to feel scared and that in turn made me frustrated and angry because i just wanted to go to sleep. i think the anger is what helped me snap out of the \"paralysis\". so i snapped out of it and immediately went back to sleep after about a minute or two. again i wake up after no more than another couple of minutes and again i am \"paralyzed\". still lying on left side facing window. it took a bit longer to snap out of it this time but i did. again getting angry at feeling afraid. i got up and smoked a cigarette and went back to bed and fell right back asleep this time lying on my right side. this 3rd and final time i wake again \"paralyzed\" but no matter how hard i try i cant snap out of it. this is where thing get \"crazy\" as i've so often been called when i tell this to people though thankfully some believe me. something touches the back of my head. i feel the pressure of it. no noticeable temperature change. this freaks me out and i can only describe my feelings as abject terror. there is an odor that is strange but not bad. the odor seems to be familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. like fresh cut grass and cinnamon/spices along with something i cant identify. i found out later from some website that 90 percent of people who report a contact experience say they smelled an incense like or spices like smell during the encounter. i about fell off my chair when i read that. any way i was freaking out inside and tried to reach back with my right arm to hit or grab whatever was there and i tried to scream for my mom but all that happened was my middle finger twitched (my hand was in my line of sight) and i made a gurgling sound. then a blue hand with what looked like a thumb and two fingers reached around in front of my face and slowly put its hand on my mouth. as soon as it touched me i felt peace and realized that everything was ok. then it disappeared. i am running out of time on this

camera exposure of 10 seconds. without moving the camera, background stars drifted to the right while the object appeard to stay in play but was actually drifting to the left.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\nit was very cold out and waiting 15 to 20 seconds before taking the next shot starting had my fingers freezing so i went inside.\r\n\r\ni will be uploading 15 pictures and it would be best viewed as a photo slidshow. the image is oblong ( looks like a comet)located in the middle bottom of each shot.  ignore image on some of the pictures located far right in the middle, it's just a tree branch.\r\n\r\nit appears that i'm only allowed 10 uploads.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

can see the lights off in the distance of point loma near san diego clearly. i often drive at night along the beaches to check the surf. a red glowing object flew directly over my car. i thought that it was a meteorite because of the brightness and the way that it seemed to blur as it moved across the sky flying directly southbound along highway 101. i was driving at a speed of 50 miles per hour and i assumed that it would burn out seconds after i saw it, but it did not, it continued on, in a straight trajectory, not losing any altitude. \r\n\tthe next thought that i had was that it was going as fast as a missile and, living in oceanside, ca near camp pendleton, it may have come from there. my confusion turned to concern, knowing that it had no other flashing lights like the jets that land at carlsbad airport or the commercial jets that fly southbound along the coast over the ocean. the only other aircrafts that fly along the coast above the land are the police helicopters that fly over head at times, but mostly over the water. \r\n\ti continued following it down the coast, rarely taking my eyes off of it so as to keep my car on the road. the light was very bright at first, like a meteorite, bigger than venus when you can see it on a clear night and it’s closest to the earth. i had kept my eyes on it for about 2 minutes when i saw that it had seemed to be flying over the sea world tower, approximately 30 miles away. i had reached leucadia and couldn’t see past the cliffs at this point but at my last view it had traveled far enough so the light was just a speck in the distance.\r\n\tin my approximations, the light was about 1000 feet off the ground and traveling at a speed faster than the f15s from miramar air force base. 30 miles in 2 minutes would equal about 900 miles per hour. i felt a bit confused as to who to call, so i remembered that on ufo shows, people report sightings to their local police department. i called the encinitas sherrif dept and they gave me the number to the faa to call and report it. the number turned out to be the national ufo reporting center. my biggest concern was that it may have been a terrorist missile and with san diego being a military center, i would have thought that there would be some kind of f15 type flights trying to figure out what was flying so low. but nothing came around for over half an hour then a police helicoptor flew overhead making it's usual rounds of the coast.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

bright hovering object, amber in color.  we decided to drive around to get a better view of it over the treetops and witnessed what looked like a triangular light pattern -- one very large, very bright amber light in the nose and a smaller flashing light on each wingtip and center which stayed illuminated but strobed brighter in order from left to right.  it passed in the opposite direction of our car.  because it was so far away we could not make out any structure.  the large light was unlike anything we had seen in the sky before in terms of its size and brightness.  once it was out of view we continued to the gas station.   \r\n\r\non the way back to the house we saw the object again, hovering back close to its original position.  it was much closer and we turned into a neighborhood to get a good look:\r\n\r\nthe object was very close.  i would compare it to watching a plane in take-off pass overhead in terms of its distances.  as we pulled into the neighborhood it stopped hovering and began moving -- drifting might be a more fitting verb -- across the sky towards us.  we parked the car and got out as the object passed directly overhead.  as it did we both witnessed the solid black outline of an equilateral diamond:  a small white running light in the center and at each tip with an over-sized, amber-colored seemingly directional (forward to forward-down) light at its nose and a significantly dimmer light on its tail.  the three lights from wingtip to wingtip constantly strobed in a right-to-left direction as it moved away from us.  the object was silent as it passed over and disappeared behind the treeline.\r\n\r\nwe jumped back into our car to try and get a better angle to continue watching it but as we circled the woods which it had passed over it was nowhere in sight -- until we happened to catch the faint strobe of the object now a great distance away.\r\n\r\nwe drove to my girlfriend's parents' house and watched this object glide back and forth across the sky at a great distance -- like a commercial plane at altitude -- for over an hour.  at one point her mother came outside to watch it pass at about 45 degrees above the horizon close enough to make out the triangular front of the object.  we kept noticing that it seemed to pass in a straight line until we could not see it anymore and then begin its trajectory again from where it started -- but we never saw it fly back.  we assumed that we simply missed its return path.  finally we watched one disappear not behind trees but simply into the distance and made sure to watch for its return.  it never flew back.  suddenly it was once again close and over our left shoulders.  we were in disbelief that it could have 1) flown back to this position with such speed and 2) have done so without us noticing.\r\n\r\nwe tracked the object as it passed about 60 degrees above the horizon when suddenly we noticed a second, identical object flying towards us from a great distance.  we continued watching these two objects pass back across the sky.\r\n\r\nthe total sighting lasted from 9:20pm to 10:45pm.  which is to say that at 10:45pm i finally came inside out of the frigid cold to write this report.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

there was little in the way of cloud and the stars were blazing. we are on the coast in country new south wales; the sky here is not obscured by the glow of street lights. when i was looking at the
