kentucky. i was at my little brother's baseball game, sitting backwards on the bleachers to watch storm clouds roll in from the distance. i have more of an appreciation for meteorology than for sports, sue me. at one point, i looked up from my phone, and my attention was suddenly drawn to some movement by the forest area, adjacent to the field. as i looked closer, i realized it was some type of aircraft. it was in the shape of an equilateral triangle, solid black in color, kinda geometric and block-like, with one white light on each point of the triangle (underneath) and some kind of opening in the middle. it flew disturbingly close to the ground. i can't remember the size exactly, but i can ballpark (lawl) that it was larger than a helicopter, but smaller than the average domestic-flight plane.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n   watching it, i took note of its movement; it was unlike anything i've ever seen (er.. supposed to have seen) in my life. it didn't seem to pay any attention to classic aerodynamics. it seemed to glide through space (anti-gravity style) rather than \"fly\", and was eerily silent. as the experience came to an end, i saw this craft suddenly change flight path. it turned on a dime (without banking) about 300¬∞, and descended below the trees, out of sight. i can still vividly remember the sudden and completely overwhelming curiosity i had. i wanted nothing more at that point than to drop everything, and run after it. i didn't want it to be over. i wanted to know everything about everything. for some reason, i didn't go after it. i was still a bit dazed, trying to process how much of my entire outlook on life i was going to have to tweak. i was a much different person back then. shy, and timid, like your average socially-awkward and confused 17-year-old.\r\n\r\ni still kick myself for not doing everything within my power to find. that. craft.\r\n\r\n \r\n   i actually wouldn't have noticed it at all if i hadn't been turned around, but thank god that i wasn't the only person to see it. a little girl sitting next to me looked up from her dsi just in time to catch a glimpse of it. \"look, grandpa! a ufo!!!\" she pointed and shouted. her grandfather paid no attention, so nobody else but her and i saw it. at that point, i knew for a fact that i wasn't crazy after all. we both knew what we were looking at.\r\n\r\n\r\n   for some reason, i didn't feel inclined to point it out to anyone around me (which included the rest of my family), as the little girl did. i simply sat there, taking in every single nanosecond of exposure to such a sight. i've been hopelessly interested in the entire subject of military technology and possible extra-terrestrial involvement with the government for quite some time now. \r\n\r\n\r\n   i felt an extreme need to tell anyone who sees and reads this: these things are indeed real. i can't say for sure whether or not these craft are owned and operated by the us military and/or foreign life, but i can say without a shadow of doubt that they're out there, being used by someone for something. for the life of me, i cannot understand why i saw this craft in the place that i did. what's so interesting about a small town in kentucky? the only thing i can think is that it had some correlation with the severe storm that approached afterward, as people commonly have sightings around disasters (natural and man-made).\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

later, i saw some translucent being in like the early fall of the year 2012. i watched this being for maybe 2 through 5 hours, but i didn't time it. the first ufos that i ever saw, on july 2, 2012, where bluish, greenish, and violet. i saw like 8 ufos that night.\r\n\r\nanyways, i am a blogger, and i made a blog about the ufos i have seen, and also the being that i saw in the year 2012. the following is from my blog that i made almost a year ago:\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst off, i saw my alien in august of 2012. i have been seeing the ufos (every day except when its cloudy out) for exactly 5 months now, since september 8th of 2013.\r\n\r\nill now explain my alien encounter: it must have been august of 2012, and it was very windy out that day. it was bright and sunny outside and it was warm because it was the summer. to make a long story short, i noticed a certain tree was blowing funny, it was windy outside. i ended up getting my bb gun to look more closely at the anomaly- the tree that was blowing too much. i sat on my bed and looked outside at the tree. at first i didnt notice anything peculiar. i was just looking at the said tree with a 4 power scope attached to a daisy air rifle. then after a few minutes, something appeared in my scope. it was a ~3 foot circle, greyish green, with 2 \"eyes\". they werent eyes but they were letting light pass right through the holes and they were positioned in the middle of the greyish green circle. im going to call this circle with the two \"eyes\" a \"face\". so i proceeded to stare at this \"face\" with my bb gun, sitting on my bed in my abode.\r\n\r\na few minutes later came splashes of light through the forehead of the \"face\". it wasnt producing any light, rather, it was producing holes that the ambient light could pass through. circle after circle of light was passing though, every second or so: this lasted for maybe a half an hour or so, but i didnt time anything.\r\n\r\nnext the whole \"face\" thing disappeared and something else was there. what appeared was the alien itself, translucent or transparent. i honestly didnt know what i was looking at, at that time; i was dumbfounded by the whole encounter to be candid. anyways, i noticed the alien moving around and looking at me. it was hard to observe because the alien was translucent or transparent. i saw the aliens face, body, arms, maybe a leg and foot, and his nose from the side view. the alien was about 15 yards from me, on top of my neighbors roof the whole time. the alien didnt move from on top of my neighbors roof, but it was moving in place. i saw the alien moving his head around, looking at me; and its a good thing he was moving his head because i wouldnt have been able to discern it otherwise. i saw the alien moving its hand and arm back and forth to its head very fast. \r\n\r\n\r\nohh yeah, and later i did a calculation, and the alien must have been 3 or 4 feet tall. if two roof shingles/caps equal a foot.\r\n\r\nit was a very spiritual experience for me and i think about my alien encounter every day; and i bet you would think of aliens too if you literally saw one like i did. weird, i know, but it still happened.\r\n\r\nthe whole time i was watching the alien was a long time, maybe two through four hours. all i know is that it was daylight out when i first started watching the alien, and i stopped watching the alien when it got dark out and i couldnt see the alien good. its hard to watch a translucent alien at night even though it was about 15 yards away.\r\n\r\nso thats what i remember of my alien encounter and i will never forget it, even though its a little vague now.\r\n\r\nnext, the ufos.\r\n\r\ni see ufos on a daily basis, except when its cloudy outside. i first noticed the ufos on september 8th of 2013. but i did see ufos one day on july 2, 2012, but i didnt see those for more then a few minutes.\r\n\r\nanyways, i first noticed the ufos that i see every day (practically) on september 8th of 2013. i noticed a \"star\" that started out higher in the sky, then the next time i went to smoke a cigarette it was lower and to the right; then next time i went to smoke, it was gone. the next day i critically observed this \"star\" and i noticed it was moving in place; i figured it must be a ufo. i then noticed more and more \"stars\" move over the next few weeks until i drew the conclusion that all the \"stars\" in my sky are actually ufos.\r\n\r\nthe ufos disguise themselves as \"stars\" in the sky but they actually move. the ufos move in every direction, but you cant discern if they are moving closer or farther away. the ufos are above the clouds. the ufos are lite up, so they must use some type of light for this. the ufos are scattered throughout the sky like stars. \r\n\r\ni want to know who is in the ufos and why dont we have that kind of technology. i can only think of a dichotomy; its either extraterrestrial or military. the ufos remain in the sky all night, i dont watch them after i go to bed though. i dont know what the ufos do during the day, but they are in my sky at night. i dont know where else you can see ufos besides massachusetts. \r\n\r\ni actully made a video about my alien encounter and the ufos i saw in 2012 and the 5 signs in the clouds i saw... let me get the video and i will close with that.\r\n\r\nthe signs of the times!\r\n\r\nthe above was from my blog that i made about a year ago. if you want to watch the video i made about the being i saw, and the ufos that i see, go to youtube.Com. next, search for \"[title moved to fi section/cms/tg]\". then search through the next few pages until you see a video titled \"[title moved to fi section/cms/tg]\". i have six videos total of myself, and at least a couple other videos, i mention that, \"i saw an alien\".\r\n\r\ni am very serious, and i have vivid memories of seeing a being in the year 2012. also, i witnessed at least a half dozen ufos on july 2, 2012, or a few months before i saw that being. these ufos were very bright, and they were colored: i remember seeing blue, green, and purple ufos on july 2, 2012. but, as of september 8th of 2013, i noticed that the \"stars\" appear to move, and i have been watching the \"stars\" move for about a year and 4 months now. i don't know if this is an optical illusion, or if i am seeing ufos? i have seen some ufos move in a straight line, and then dim into blackness, and i have witnessed this at least a few times. they look like stars, they blink, they glow like a star, but i see them moving around.\r\n\r\nthanks for taking the time to read this.\r\n\r\n~peace~\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet,

of gloom or an ominous feeling that something was going to happen. just a few minutes later i was on my front porch using the grill it was already very dark but very clear with lots of stars out. i had been noticing a lot of planes in the sky, a couple flew over so low i could almost read the numbers on them. it was very unusual for so much traffic in the sky, at least it seemed strange to see so many in just an hour or so. as i looked back down the valley approximately nw i noticed a star-like object much lower in the sky than the other stars that where out. the reason i even looked in that direction is because over the past 2 years my wife and i have seen something very similar to this about six times. the first time i saw it for several nights in a row around the same time of year and around the same of day. the object was staying in almost the exact same spot but it did move up and to the left and then settled back down and then moved up and to the right. so i called for my wife to come look at it, and to prove to me that i wasn't crazy..Lol she saw it too and we watched it together for a few minutes but it was very cold so she went back in the house. i continued watching it for several more minutes and it very slowly dropped behind the mountain range until i couldn't see it anymore. i kept looking up at the sky, at this point i couldn't stop. a few minutes later i noticed 2 planes very high in the sky flying in the direction of the object but much higher up. as they flew in the nw direction a small white light that looked much higher in the sky flew towards them at a speed i couldn't believe and then stopped right passed them. it was 100 times faster than the planes where, it hovered in the same spot for maybe a minute then flew away as fast as it passed the planes. all of this happened in about 30-45 minutes. after i went in the house it kinda shook me up a little, almost made me a little nervous. i really feel like an idiot, but i've seen

in the sky about a block south of us. we began driving in its direction. it disappeared. moments later we could see it several blocks away so we kept driving in the direction. when we came close to it, we put the car in park on university avenue and i recorded it before pulling into a small business area. it was hovering over some trees and kept going lower and lower. suddenly, it went into a sideways oval shape and turned completely clear, almost invisible...But we could still see it and we watched it for a couple minutes before it lowered out of sight behind the trees. i quickly jumped out of the car only to see 4 or 5 more lights moving slowly and in sync above us and then hovering. we watched for several minutes. we called my sister who was at our house where we first saw the light...She ran outside and could see the bright orange lights blocks away, that my mom and i were directly under somehow we both looked away, i am not sure why...And they were gone. i rarely get headaches, but i was struck with the most pounding headache that it nearly threw me to the ground. i held my head in pain and it pounded. it was especially in the front, but went all around my head. i have never felt a headache like that in my entire life....Shortly after we left the sighting area, my headache left as quickly as it appeared. we recorded from my moms phones, the video quality is not great. for some reason the lights do not show up orange on the video, but when we play it on her phone, you can see the orange. in the first video, you will see the main light moving around. in the bottom right corner there is another one blinking. also, above that one, if you look very closely you can see something orange fading in and out. this recording is of the one we saw before the 5 other ones, but clearly we caught more than one in the video. the photos also show up much better on the phone and if you look at each one... there are three lights, and they form a perfect triangle together. nearly two years ago, my friend and i saw something similar from my balcony which is close to this sighting. it was 2 sets of three bright orange lights in the form of a triangle like the pictures appear. one by one the orange lights shot off the triangle form and turned clear/invisible...We watched them in their clear form for several minutes before they disappeared. we are close to provo canyon and power lines.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

maybe 80 degrees and clear skies. me and my buddy went for a drive on the back roads outside of town. basically the farm/country roads. we were in high school and he just got his new car so we went for a drive. we we only driving for about 10 mins when the occurance happened. \r\nwe were coming up to a really steep hill when i noticed an a lighted object hovering on top of the hill. it was in the air, on top of the hill and directly over the road way. and it was stationairy. 100% still. i remember it was pretty creepy so i too him to slow down. he seen it and we stopped. it had three lights. 2 bright white lights and a redish gold light that would come on once in a while.  once we stopped it moved fast, right above us.  the car had glass t-tops it was an older camaro so i could still see it. it wasn't directly above us but it was above us and to the right a little bit. so once it got there it hovered for about 15 seconds i seen the red light a couple times. \r\ni told my buddy to get the heck out of here and he floored it. when we took off i was still watching it and it took off fast and dissapeared. we both thought it was a ufo.  \r\nwe live by an airport and have our lives. we know what a helicopter looks like at night and what planes look like. we know what a helicopter sounds like, they are loud when they are above you. this object had no sound. the actual size of this thing was maybe 30-40 feet. i'm pretty sure it was triangular but it could have been disc shaped with 3 lights in a triangular pattern. \r\nso that's about it. some people believe me when i tell them. skeptics won't ever believe you and just think it's science fiction.(because we have to be the only ones in the universe). lol we are not even a grain of sand on a beach. well maybe a

star or just a dot you could even say. we tried to use a scope many times to zoom in and both we could even tell it was nor a plane or helicopter or a drone, we know what all 3 do and their capabilities, we are educated people. the lights pulsed from red, yellow, blue, green, violet, and pink. there were 3 in the sky nearly in alignment, each pulsing in sequences to each other in what looked to be a communicative pattern, not to mention as they puled they seemed to respond in colour patterns to each's own. sometimes when we felt messages were not being sent or transceived they would all pulsate at the same pace and colours together sometimes. if we could zoom in closer we could make out a shape of what seemed to be either a disc or triangle. the colours would also outline the shape of the craft as they pulsed, each light pulsing in a specific spot.\r\ni then felt a massive head ache come on which was completely abnormal and instantaneous as the craft drew closer. it is here nightly. never leaves. we have no pictures but the evidence lies in the sky. also on one account when it did disappear once a few months ago, it slowly and silently flew over our house, if it were a plane we  could have heard it, even if it were a helicopter, but it was silent, fast and suddenly shot out of sight as if it were the millennium falcon going into hyperspeed. it is visible from sundown through the night, they fly a short distance and stop, as if they are observing things, they cast long craft to earth beams at times in the mountains that appear golden/yellowy orange and what seems to be abductions from afar. the numbers are growing and we feel there is an invasion or incoming invasion of our area. they stay steady nightly.\r\nplease reply as soon as

morning at first light; not really light outside but not dark either. i saw an object with flickering lights red, white, and green hovering over the tree line across the little valley looking toward central avenue.  i thought it was a helicopter so didn't pay it much mind. but as i looked for birds, owls or hawks or anything, i noticed the thing did not move. i thought that was strange. if it was a helicopter i thought i would hear it so i cracked open the window to see if i could hear anything.  there was no noise at all. it just stayed there, and i thought it strange since helicopters make noise and usually don't hover like that, plus i didn't see a tail.  then i saw two other objects maybe smaller than the first one. they were to the left (the east side) of the first object. one of the objects darted in a straight line horizontally to the first object. then i grabbed my binoculars to see if i could see it better, but the screen was in the way. (it is a normal window and screen but when you put binoculars next to it the screen blurs the view. i could see the lights on the objects as if looking out of a window normally.) when i looked up from the window the things were gone. a moment later my husband came in and i told him what i saw. he was not in the room at the time, and when he came to the window the objects were already gone. i wished i had my camera at the time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":62464,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.9382399,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01062015-0019","longitude":-73.89438689999999,"occurred":1419690300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1420615218000,"summary":"Roundish object hovered quietly, then 2 others appeared, one shot horizontally to the first object, then all 3 disappeared.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"10710","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":10,"locationName":"Yonkers, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:69439"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Escondido","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We saw what looked like stars in the sky, but realized they were green and red lights.    some lower some higher, around the constellation orion. they were stationary the whole time.  we saw a plane fly past which made noise and was much lower.  these never moved the whole time we watched them, for about 20 minutes. there were about 8 of them. we were walking the dog down our street.  at first i thought they were stars or planets.  but then we thought what planet or star looks red and green?  they never moved at all.

the orange \"ball\" started at the size of approx. a tennis ball or golf ball, then zoomed toward us until it was the approx. size of a large grapefruit or a little smaller than a basket ball. black or dark grey smoke came or radiated from it. it came forward then retreated back to its original position very quickly several times, every ten or so seconds. we had no idea what the object was or is. neither of us felt fearful or any physical sensations, only a great curiosity at the wonder of it. i don't understand why everyone else did not see it. we were only about two blocks from a busy
