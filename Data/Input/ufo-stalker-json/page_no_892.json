insula corsica mai exact intr-un sat numit sierrera.M-am gandit sa scriu despre niste lucruri ciudate de care am avut parte.Primul este acela ca in data de 05.01.2015 mergeam acasa din sat in munti si pe drum am vazut un obiect zburator,cred ca a fost rotund de culoare alba care zbura la o altitudine mica in linie dreapta deasupra muntilor si nu facea zgomot.Mi-am dat seama din prima secunda despre ce e vorba.Am fost foarte fericit cu gandul ca insfarsit am vazut si eu un ozn real si ca insfarsit am vazut dovada existentei ozn-urilor.Celalat eveniment tot in aceeasi zi putinel mai tarziu cand apunea soarele am vazut o bila in flacari pe cer care pica,m-am gandit ca e un meteorit si acum aterizeaza si o sa faca ravagii,dar in schimb nu am auzit nimic,nu am vazut explozie sa ceva de genu...Nici la stiri nimic nu s-a auzit de acesta.M-am simtit entuziasmat pentru ca e prima oara cand vad asa ceva.M-am gandit sa merg si sa caut locul aterizarii dar nu am putut sa-mi permit ca era noapte.Dupa scurt timp am mers la cabana unde locuiesc(in munti) iar pe drum am tot privit cerul atent si am zarit mai multe luminite ca si stelele care zburau zigzag.Am stiut ca sunt ozn-uri ca altceva nu puteau fi.M-am gandit sa impartasesc cele traite si cu alti si am dat de acest site.Am vazut ce au impartasit ceilalti si am zis ca scriu si eu despre cele vazute de mine.","distance":"Over

another vehicle to meet up and go into an area we were intereested in. as soon as we met up, the vehicle (our friends) began driving to a high spot. we eventually began to follow the other vehicle we lost them, which was no big deal. we then saw some headlights in the distance on a spot opposite from where our meeting spot was.  we then started to pursue the headlights which were something that freak us out later, when we drove up the hill and only acceablie way to where we thought was our friends. when we made it to the higher level there were no cars whats so ever, we then saw the headlights flashi once on a much higher plateau which confused the hell out of us because the highth and the time it would take to get to the top of this plateau was freaky fast. when we got half way up to where the plateau was we saw a car coming down from our meeting spot from earlier which freaked us out thinking it was a farmer following us but all along it was our friends vehicle. but at this point we still think we're following our friends, and we finally make it to the top to find no one at all we were confused we all had very good binoculars and we saw the car that we thought was farmers finally make it up to where we were. by this time we had seen multiple ufos that were stationary that balls of light begin to move in odd maneuvers to the east of us and we could clearly see that they were moving miles and miles a direction and turning around and going back miles and miles from where we saw them and began to be stationary. we were convinced we followed a ufo that led us up on the plateua. we saw the car approach us and eventually seeing it was our friends car. we were terrified because we thought we were following them and when we began looking above we saw which to me and the rest of us in the car thought was a ufo right above us which looked completely different from the ones on the horizon. we stayed up there from about 4-sun up when it was dark we could see tail lights show up out of know where from about 2-3 miles away now these we weird red lights there were standard 2 red lights like a car but had another red light of to the right like an right triangles vertices. the weird thing is we didn't see no headlights at all!! we had miles and miles of vantage view and did no see no headlights move in a traditional way. these lights just showed up and dissapared we waited untill light and saw no cars. there was one way up and one way out. the morning came and all dissapeared except for one, the one above us, the only light in the sky. i'm pretty familiar with the brightest stars in the sky and orion had passed the horizon east of us and the brightest stars dicipated from the sun but this one followed us every where untill we shrugged them off and began hunting. there was a building up top and had a tower that had telephone satellites the tower was far too short for regulation blinking lights for a warning to airplanes. it was odd/thrilling/ exciting to the point i was petrified to take a piss haha the funny thing is when we were done hunting we told our friends we went so high up there to follow them and they were confused and laughing saying we got tricked by a ufo. we had very good binoculars and two high scoped riles so we were not looking with the naked eye. although it was dark, this area where we were was pretty rural( no houses in sight for miles) i believe they landed because these things were manipulating themselves into cars literally or deceiving us. there was no drinking or drugs involved.

however, i have had many sightings and feel as though i may be under surveillance. my experiences started when i was eight and persist to this day. i need to speak with someone who has experience with these matters. i need to understand. \r\n\r\ni only want to be contacted via email. i do not want my name associated with this report. \r\n\r\n  a couple years ago, i had been out with friends until around 1:00 am. i was driving home the way i always go. i have a heavy foot and was enjoying an exciting drive on empty roads. \r\n  as i was coming up to a nice s curve i noticed what i thought to be a deer moving thru the brush to my right about to cross the road in front of me. i braked hard to avoid a collision. \r\n   as the \"deer\" crossed the road in front of me, i was just clearing the bend and could see the road ahead. \r\n  i immediately saw the glowing kashmir blue light brightly emanating from the \"mask/helmet/face\" of a tall \"man\" standing on the left side of the road. \"he\" must have stood seven feet tall or more. the \"deer\" ran up to the \"man\" and stopped directly in front of \"him\". \r\n  in the next second my headlights fell directly on the pair. i had slowed down to a speed of about 15-20 mph to avoid the collision and had a clear direct view. this next second lasted an hour in my mind. \r\n  the creature was similar to a deer in size and overall shape. it had a dark brown/grey covering that i want to call fur but was more likely leathery. it had the head similar to a dog with an elongated snout and short ears. it had the build of a greyhound with long legs supporting a smaller, slender frame. the legs were strange. they may have bent backwards but i cannot be sure. i recall that it moved strangely as it crossed the road. it had no visible tail. \r\n  the \"man\" was tall, as i said before with a human build. \"he\" was wearing a black suit that had several \"tools\" and pockets. similar to something a navy seal would wear during nighttime ops. \"he\" was covered from hard to toe. gloves, boots, and mask all connected. there was no flesh exposed, like an astronaut's suit. \"he\" had a visor over his \"eyes\" that glowed a soft velvety blue brightly. the visor was rectangular with rounded edges and was positioned to be consistent with human anatomy. the light obscured the shape of the head somewhat, but again, it seemed to have a head consistent with human anatomy from a straightforward perspective. \r\n  \"he\" was watching me as closely as i was watching \"him\" as i passed slowly seven feet away. we made \"eye\" contact and the blue glow followed me in my rear view mirror until i made the next bend and \"he\" was out of sight. \r\n  at this point a very unsettling thing occurred. i felt \"him\" call to me. it was like a feeling more than words. it wanted me to come back. it was a strong \"urge\" to turn around mixed with feelings of peace and tranquility. suddenly i realized that i had unconsciously brought my car to a stop. this frightened me to my core. it still does. i immediately floored the car and blew the stop sign at the end of the road as i raced to home and safety. \r\n  \r\n  in the years that passed, several small incidents occurred that could be and were written off as just strange. however, a pattern was developing. \r\n  it wasn't until four years later that i was able to confirm my suspicions.\r\n  my girlfriend and i moved to a secluded location in upper bucks county. we used to smoke cigarettes on the front porch late at night. one winter night we noticed a very bright flash of white light coming from the back woods behind the house. it was so bright it could have been lightning, but there was no clouds in the sky. we went to the back yard to investigate becoming suspicious of a possible intruder taking pictures in our woods. the flashing continued intermittently but with no discernible pattern. \r\n  i then realized that the light was actually off the ground at least ten feet. this made us uncomfortable and we went inside. \r\n  this became a reoccurring phenomena at our home until one night we decided to find the source. we took a gun and a giant spotlight and tried to find it. we drove around the back of our property and discovered that it was definitely coming from our woods. we listened and watched in silence but heard nothing and could only see the light in the sky above not directly towards us. we then drove back to our driveway and began to see it clearly again. i tried to flash it and find it with the spotlight but had no luck. it simply flashed as it pleased with no reaction to us.\r\n  then we heard a familiar sound. it sounded as though a 747 was going overhead. i expected to see a low flying airliner pass overhead but was instead shocked at what i saw. a triangular craft passed slowly overhead maybe a hundred feet above us. it had three red flashing lights at each point and several smaller glowing orange lights in between. it was making the sound of a large jet airplane, however, if it had been a jet it would have deafened us at the distance it passed. it also moved much to slowly to be any type of jet propelled craft. it was approximately 30 feet wide and had cubic features. \r\n  the craft moved over us and paused briefly directly over where we thought the source of the light to be coming from. it then vanished without sound and there was no more flashes of light that evening. we assume that it had collected some sort of probe that was spying on us. \r\n  this incident frightened my girlfriend and she was no longer willing to investigate the flashing lights that persisted on several occasions. \r\n  not long after that, i became aware that i was being startled awake several nights a week at precisely 3:33 am. it happened so frequently and was so unsettling that i began to research the \"condition\" i might be suffering from. i tried the suggestions provided by other people experience but came to no solid conclusions. then i found a page that tied 3:33 am to ufo activity and connected the dots. \r\n  once i became afraid of the possibility of abduction i discontinued discussing anything of the sort with my spouse. i do not want her to be afraid. \r\n   since then we have moved twice and have not encountered any more lights. however, we also quit smoking and quit looking. we don't go out late at night. i forced myself to stop looking at the clock when i wake up at night. i also now use sleep inducing drugs at night and i can't remember my dreams anymore, which suits me fine. \r\n  \r\n  i want to know if anyone else out there has seen this \"man\" with the blue light or are being monitored by flashing lights. they are not inconspicuous. i also need to know if my new daughter is safe. is there anyway to be safe? will a secure bunker keep them out? is there a possibility that these are non violent, harmless watchers or are they all invasive abductors? \r\nplease advise.

….... after shopping from local shoprite attention was drawn to the north west sky of a low slow moving light that was changing colors in sequence, not strobing but steady pulses of red,blue green and then it would repeat itself.. at first thought it was a helicopter but when it hovered made a complete tight circle and then shot off to the north turning a solid green i thought otherwise. my ground

(the lights, i'd estimate 10-50 points of light illuminated at any one time) moved, morphed, and gave the object the appearance of splitting into 2 objects from time to time, only to merge back together. the best explanation i can give of the ufo's appearance is that it looked a bit like a giant led disco ball, with its movements and it's lights pulsing very organically. it looked, for lack of a better word, alive, nothing at all like the blinking of a video game arcade or advertising display. after about 20 minutes of watching the object, i finally made up my mind and went to

often had the window open even in winter. this was to have a cool breeze so i didnt fall asleep..On the night my window also happened to open.. i was sitting reading when all of a sudden i had this strange feeling that something was going to happen at which point as i glanced up a very bright ufo, appeared from behind my neighbours house.It flew between the houses that back onto mine 3 times each time it lit up very brightly.  at this point i closed the window and the cutains and essentially hid for a 2 or 3 minutes. when i looked out from behind my curtain it was hovering above the hose next door to me and sort of blinking brightly before dimming and so on.I also noticed a red coloured tinge on the underside of it at this point. this was the last time i saw it.  interestingly, on this day i remember it well as i was on my way home i bumped into my mother and her husband on the way and she had complained i was wearing the wrong clothes as this day was quite mild and warm and i had on a boots coat ad so onand she told me to get changed. after this as i approached the front of the house i for some reason looked up and right away noticed a strange triangular cloud above the roof of the house. literally scraping the roof but actually there were hardly any other clouds around at the time. i thought this odd but thought no more of it. i am sorry to see i do not have any media of any nature to confirm my case but that i do seem to remember that there reports a short after in the local press that flying saucers had been seen in sheffield. but i have never seen this reports.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

the salon i worked at, i drove home. sky was clear and roads were empty as much of the town was sleeping. i saw light coming from over my car and leaned to peer out windshield. almost directly over my car, just above the tree line, i saw a black triangular shaped object with soft lights covering the entire bottom surface in sort of a bowling pin pattern. they were not blinding and i was able to see the black structure between the lights. it moved at approximately 5mph and made no sound. i stopped my car because no one was behind me and put my window down to listen. i still heard nothing. i felt like i could reach out and touch the thing. i didn't feel threatened and i didn't feel i was noticed. it was probably 60 feet or longer. i watched it for about two or three minutes wondering if it was a stealth, since i'd never seen one and lived near tinker air force base. but after a few minutes, i felt i was being watched and proceeded home, resisting the urge to look in the rearview mirror. the object never messed with anything electric with my car, the street lights stayed on, and no homes appeared to lose power. in recent searches, i haven't seen pictures of any stealth's that have lights like this underneath. and i've only told a few people up until now. i've told myself for years it was probably something from the base, but deep down i've serious doubts that anything man made could move so slow and silent.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
