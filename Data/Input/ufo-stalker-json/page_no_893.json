a word rhyming game which we always play on our walks.  he was taking longer than usual trying to find a word and was looking down.  i was ho-humming, looking around at the houses which we were walking by when my upper-right peripheral vision caught site of two very bright amber-colored lights.  i couldn't believe it!  he looked up right away.  we saw two orb-like lights (i think in the southwestern sky), one light over the other, with generous space between them.  i pointed to them, and he quickly pushed my arm down, telling me that my action might not be a good idea in case we might be seen by them/it.  we started walking a little faster, as if somehow we might catch up with it.  unfortunately, i need eye-glasses for distance; i don't bring them on our walks, as i can't see him as clearly as i can without them.  so the amber orbs, to me, looked as if rays were completely encircling a more solid center portion.  he has great distance vision and, to him, the two lights appeared round and solid.  inside of a minute's time, we saw the lower light descend a bit, though noticeably, from the top light.  the lower light then moved to the left.  and here is where we differ

by tapping hard on my feet and up my body until one tapped my face, then i sat up in my bed and saw what it was a 3'6\" humanoid being wearing a flat black hooded robe with a seem less helmet covering the beings facial features. i began to scream but no noise came out, i tried to move my arms and body but i was paralyzed sitting up i felt one on the side of my bed but could not turn my head to see it so i focused my eyes on the being at the foot of my bed and tried to fight to move so i could run or scream but no luck . as fear overtook my senses the being at the foot of my bed became translucent and then disappeared. i gained control of my body as soon as the being disappeared the whole event lasted 2 to 3 minutes but i believe i was either being returned from an abduction or about to be abducted. i felt extreme fear, but also felt some what sedated, and exhausted. i was sharing the dorm room with my room mate and i woke him up and told him what i saw then asked if he would wave his hands around through the room to see if they were there but invisible so we did and found nothing. several months later my room mate saw a being around the same time at night in the same room. i was not there for his event. this all took place at a army base in san luis obisbo 400 feet from a helicopter landing pad . the army was completely not aware of the event on the base and i was to scared of repercussions if i reported it to anyone . not one airplane or helicopter in the sky. the beings gained access to the army base without any detection. before my experience i never believed in life outside of earth. i never saw a ufo that night i did look outside into the sky for evidence, but no ufo.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hello, my experience did not involve a ufo but still just as scary. when i was a little girl, i shared a room with my three sisters. i shared a bunkbed with my younger sister and my two older sisters shared the other bunkbed across the room, facing the opening of the bedroom door. my two brothers and oldest sister moved out so my older sister took the spare bedroom and i moved to the empty bed on the other side of the room. there were always paranormal events that took place but unfortunately for me, i was the only one seeing and hearing them. i was brutally punished for speaking about my experiences so from that point on, i had to deal with these scary events on my own. once i moved to the other side of the room, almost immediately i started to wake up in the middle of the night for absolutely no reason. when i would wake up, i always saw the same three beings standing in the doorway of my bedroom door. they were shaped like the all too familiar \"little grey men\". they had the large head, thin build with a little belly, long arms and short legs. one thing i couldn't help but notice is that i could see right thru them!! their bodies were visibly outlined but i could see thru them and they had these large bright blue almond shaped eyes. the three beings were different sizes. the smallest was directly in the front, the other was a little taller and the tallest of the three was almost as tall as the doorway opening. i was always questioning if i was actually seeing this, especially since it kept happening, night after night. i remember they would just stand in the doorway, looking around as if they were looking out to make sure no one was coming. they would sometimes, glance at me but continue to look around. again, i wasnt sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me because it was very dark, but they were also moving around so i just couldnt get my mind to comprehend what i was seeing. i also remember it was very silent. too silent, as if someone had eliminated the sound all together. i can recall on one occasion , rubbing my hands on the sheet under my pillow, trying to hear the sound it usually makes.....There was nothing.  absolutely no noise. i couldnt understand it. i dont remember being scared, just confused, intrigued, and vass amount of other emotions. this went on for sometime. i can not recall for how long nor can i recall how or when i went to sleep. i always woke up the next morning questioning my sanity. the very last encounter i remember is when, once again i was awakened and saw the same three beings in the doorway. this time was much different because this time for whatever reason, i decided to look in the direction of my feet. when i did that, i saw another being who looked exactly like the other three. it was on its knees, kneeling right next do me at my midsection.  i was laying on my back and as i made eye contact with it, it leaned in within inches of my face and then it put its hand on my chest. for whatever reason, i was not scared but i did experience a rush of many other emotions. i remember being curious more than anything. i wanted to know if i was really loosing my mind or is this thing really real. from under the cover, i began moving my hand toward the creatures hand with the thiught in mind that if i touch its hand and feel it under my hand, then i know it is real. so, i did just that. my hand stayed under the cover, but i still placed my hand on its hand and when i felt it, thats when i realized it was real. i still wasnt afraid for some strange reason but at the same time, i could not believe what i was feeling. the entire time this is happening, this thing is still in my face and we are looking eachother in the eyes. the last thing i remember is touching its hand and then waking up the next morning.  i sometimes wondered what happened in all thise encounters. what dont i remember.  but i know, i really dont want to know the answer to that question. i never mentioned this to anyone, especially my family because of the severe punishments i had received before when i attempted to explain the paranormal entities i had been seeing. it wasnt until twenty years later (3 yrs ago) i was having a conversation with my older sister. we were reminiscing about that house. at first i shared with her my experiences with the paranormal. she then shared with me a story that sent chills dwon my spine. she told me that the bunk bed she slept in ( the one i slept in when she changed rooms) was a scary sleeping place for her. she explained that she had seen, on several occasions,  a face leaning over from behind her, just staring at her. she said that because there was only about 3 inches if space from the wall to the bed, that no one would be able to fit in that space. she went on to tell me that this face was big, she could see right thru it, and it had large blue almond shaped eyes. it was then that i knew for a fact that i wasnt crazy. i had carried this with me for years and never told a soul because despite my experiences,  i was still unsure of what had taken place...Even though it happened often. i told my sister about my experiences and was so relieved that i wasnt alone. to this day, i wonder why? what did they want with us? what did they do? and what dont i remember.  i just pray they never come back. apart of me wonders if they did ever come back but i just dont remember any of it because they took those memories away from me. i have always had a problem with walking in my sleep. ive had this issue all my life. i still do it to this day, but when i wake up outside my front door, or on the grass, or when i wake up with bruises, i can only wonder if i was just sleep walking or was it something more. i would love to get answers. i would live to know if anyone else has had an experience similar to mine. thanks for reading my story.","distance":"20 Feet or

was living in the mountains.We was stayn with her dad.Me and him got into a fight so us four got into our blazer and left.We went a few miles down dirt road to a pull off.The kids fell asleep.I carried a 22 pistol the only bullets i had was birdshot.The x and i were standn outside the truck.I was on a.Taller mountain so we had a view of a.Valley of trees and mountains past it.We seen this bright light above the trees in the valley we was looking down on.We knew.There wasn't a.Light in that part of the woods.I knew where everone lived.For sure shouldn't a light there.So we got to really lookn\r\nat and and we could clearly see the tree tops under the light.The only thing that made sense was that a oil rig was brought in it and the height of it was rite with rig but there was no way that we wouldn't have heard about it.Then the light got real bright almost seemed it was shining at us.That went one for a minute or 2.Then it started to move our way slowly and stopped then this thing started to swing like it was hangn from a string.Like a pendulum.And it did it over and over.Then stopped and started going straight across instead of half moon.It did.This over and over.We was staring at this thing with our mouth open.Then it slowly started towards us.This thing got close enough i could actually hit it with a rock.The light wasn't bright by now just a glow.Then all the sudden lights started flashn almost identical to a simon says game.Red blue and green yellow.It got so close that my x was freakn out screaming for me to shoot it.She kept screaming shoot it.I told her there ain't no way i am shootn that thing with birdshot.I am terrified by now it was.So close.I really believed it was going to suck us up and i was really worried about my 2 sleepn young girls.We was standn away from truck and it was rite in front of us.It was just flashn colors in a circle the same colors over and over.Seemed to last forever.I was so scared that it was going to take us two.Its hard to describe how it felt.But after what seemed like forever then it slowly left in oppiste direction it came.This happened like over ten years ago and i haven't told but a few ppl.Wish i could get hypnotize and go thru it.There isn't no way i am mistaken about this.Not when u could hit it with a rock...There is a rock with real strange stuff if u would like a picture.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then
