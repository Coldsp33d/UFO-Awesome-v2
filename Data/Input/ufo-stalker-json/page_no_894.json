time) 6 year old son when i noticed very bright large arcing flashes of light about 200 to 250 feet off the ground and at least 60 to 100 feet in diameter. at first i thought a helicopter must have crashed into a tv tower or some power-lines, as there is a lot of helicopter traffic and 5 or 6 large tv and radio transmission towers in the area. i pulled into the nearest parking lot to get a better view.\r\n\r\nthe fireball of light was moving from north to south at a relatively slow rate of speed. as it passed almost directly overhead, it made no sound and the arcing  white lights diminished to an orange/red ball of fire. i could not believe what i was seeing, so i asked my son if what was in the sky looked like a helicopter; he gave me a strange look and said \"that's a ball of fire daddy\". my brain was now shrinking to the size of a peanut.\r\n\r\nthe fire coming from the bottom looked very similar to the videos you see of close ups of the sun and the spectacular lights emitting from the top looked similar to the flashes emitted while welding.  \r\n\r\nit came to a stop over a pond not far away and began to ascend straight up through the clouds until we could no longer see it.\r\n\r\nas we turned to head back to our truck, i noticed two other people in the parking lot still looking into the sky where we last saw the fireball. one of them shouted something like \"what the blank was that\". still shaken, we continued to the truck when i heard the unmistakable roaring sound of military aircraft with their after-burners on, just above the cloud cover.I could feel the ground shaking but, i couldn't see the jets because of the clouds. i've lived in jacksonville most of my life where we have two naval bases, and i know the sound of jet-fighters w/after-burners on.\r\n\r\nwhen we got home, my son ran to tell his mommy \"we saw a ufo\". after hearing the story, my wife asked me why i had not talked to the people in the parking lot to corroborate our story. i guess i wasn't thinking of that since my brain at the time was the size of a peanut.\r\n\r\nour close proximity to the object leaves no doubt in my mind this thing was not of this earth.I can't believe it was so close.I used to make fun of people who made such claims and that's why i waited so long to tell my story.This has changed my life forever and has since, sent me on a quest to find out just what it was we saw, what are they doing here and will it or they harm us.\r\n\r\nmy eyes are open now and i will never be the same. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

if you inspect it frame by frame, there is something very strange going on - going past the window at a very high rate of speed. \r\n\r\nthere is also a sparkly white object to the right of the main white orb, at various times throughout all of the first three clips. \r\n\r\nas the turbulence was getting quite bad, i was asked to go to my seat and strap in. it was about half an hour later that i was allowed to get up again -

at the store prior to 6:00am. i lived 45-50 minutes away and had left a little after 4:30am to head east to palmer from easthampton, ma. \r\n i got on the massachussetts turnpike at what would be mass pike exit 4 at ingleside - holyoke, ma and proceeded eastbound toward palmer. there was virtually no traffic. it was cold and very clear and the night sky was full of stars which were easily seen through my windshield. as i headed east towards palmer, i noticed one star in particular at about 30 degrees above the \"horizon\" straight in my field of view that was oddly colored an vivid amber hue and exceptionally bright in relation to the other stars in the sky. i assumed i was looking at a large gas planet such as saturn or jupiter that i normally wouldn't see during my normal commute. i had never seen a atar or planet colored amber before.\r\n the mass pike (i-90 runs virtually east to west cross-country, and it does run east to west in almost a straight line through massachussetts. from my entrance point to the palmer exit, it is pretty flat as well, so the object remained pretty much at the same angle in the sky during the beginning of my commute.\r\n as i continued and each mile went by, i couldn't help but notice the object getting bigger and higher in the sky. it was at this time i began to wonder whether or not i was witnessing a meteor entering the atmosphere. after a few more miles, i realized that this object couldn't be a meteor as there was no fireball, no contrail, no glare, just this amber light getting bigger and higher in my windsheild.\r\n after traveling about 10 miles, this amber object really stood out and there appeared to be a shape to it, and it was high up. i was focusing on it as i drove on, and with each additional mile, it climbed higher, got a little bigger and started taking on what appeared to be a triangular shape at an angle.\r\n i passed the ludlow exits and the ludlow turnpike rest area and this object was getting huge. a mile or so past the ludlow rest area, this object had moved almost virtually overhead and could now be viewed out of my drivers door window which was facing north. \r\n i was looking up at a large triangular solid amber lit object. it appeared to be between 6000 to 8000 feet high. it was huge. i immediately pulled over to the shoulder and stopped, and i rolled down my window and turned off my engine. \r\n it was unbelievable. this triangular object did not have pointed corners, but instead had rounded ones. this rounded triangular object was completely full of light. the amber light was rich, and frankly quite beautiful. i have never seen anything like this amber light color anywhere.\r\n there was no \"structure\" around this lit triangle, and there was no type of structural members within the field of light. this object did not make a sound, and what stood out to me was how absolutely still this object was. it did not shake or shimmy, it did not sway in the wind, it was perfectly motionless as if an artist had \"painted\" it onto the sky. it was defying gravity...Defying gravity right before my eyes. i was in awe. i knew i was looking at something that was far beyond any technology this planet possesses. this object defied all science as i knew it. there would be no reason for us to build this big of an object and illuminate the entire bottom of it with this deep amber light. \r\n another thing i noticed, the light was perfectly uniform within the triangle, meaning, the light was the same intensity in the rounded corners as it was in the dead center. there was no indication that there was any type of \"lamp\" or multiple lamps illuminating this surface either from the sides or behind. the light did not sparkle, it did not shine, there was no glare or glare on the sides of the triangle, it just looked like it was painted motionless on the sky overhead. i did not have a camera or cell phone with a camera, which i regret every day. i wondered if the triangular area of light i was seeing was the bottom of the entire craft, or was it attached to something much bigger i just couldn't see in the dark.\r\n after a minute or so, a few vehicles went by me and i decided to get back on the road as i was going to be late for work. as i drove east toward exit 8 (which was my exit), and the object remained in it's place. at this point, i would have to turn my head completely around to see it taking my eyes off the road so i could no longer watch. it dawned on me at that time that the craft had been stationary the entire 20-25 minute trip...It had never moved. it was \"parked\" in our sky defying gravity...It appeared to rise in the sky because i was driving toward it and eventually \"under\" it. it never moved an inch the entire time.\r\n i was going to tell the toll booth operator to call westover air base, as the object was only a few miles to it's east, but i clammed up when exiting the turnpike. i was really shocked over the encounter i had just had, as i was convinced and still am to this day that i saw something from another place besides earth. at the same time, i feel very privledged to have been able to witness this event in my lifetime. i know what i saw, and it wasn't ours. i have only discussed this with one person, as i was convinced that others would probably call me a nut. i wanted to protect myself and my daughter's reputation. that may or may not have been the right choice. there isn't a day that goes by that the experience doesn't pop into my mind. i made myself a promise that this year, 2015, i would share this experience hoping maybe someone else had reported this event.\r\nthank you,\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

(phoenix skies are very clear and you can see for miles, especially down a straight stretch of road.)  anyway, it was hovering and then it started to descend.  i kept thinking, this definitely isn't a banner because it looked very thick, and because it was descending like a craft.  it actually stopped midair before it descended.  then it was gone from my sight because it had landed somewhere.  i thought about looking to see where it landed but as big as phoenix is, there's no way of knowing, but i did notice as i drove that some people were looking in the sky in that direction.  it had to have landed in mesa which is only three or four miles from where i was.  also, i figured it would be on the news tonight, and it's only just now 9pm, so i'm going to watch.  but, i would like to know if anyone else saw this and if it's something i haven't thought of.  i've never seen anything like this.  i would like to know if other people saw it and if it's something other than a craft.  i thought about filming it, but i was driving and my camera on my phone is horrible.  now i wished i had.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":62376,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4218043,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01022015-0037","longitude":-111.82689239999999,"occurred":1420185600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1420269324000,"summary":"I saw a green-grey rectangular thing move across a busy road and then descend north of it in mesa, az.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Mesa, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:71001"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Botwood","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Parents friends were driving on new years eve to botwood newfoundland. when they noticed multiple lights in the sky to the north east. they pulled over and took a picture and seconds after the shapes divided into three or four sections, and at high speed flew off into different directions. the picture included only shows one group of the lights there were more off to the right outside of the camera angle. \r\n\r\nwe thought maybe they were dash light reflections as skeptics we looked up the model of vehicle (ford f-150) and looked for ourselves at the dash lights themselves and nothing resembled anything the picture has to offer.\r\n\r\nfour of the family members are really shaken up by the experience and have yet to stop speaking about it. \r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":62375,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.1422983,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01022015-0036","longitude":-55.3440853,"occurred":1420088400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Newfoundland and Lab","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1420268058000,"summary":"Family members seen lights in sky which appeared to be a large ship. with more lights in multiple directions.

and my friends were making their way out the door to the car and i heard a shout \" what the heck it that?\".  i was on my way up the stairs and heard my husband shout \"quickly get out here and see this\".  as soon as i got to the door i could see both families (numbering 7 people) staring up at the sky ahead of them.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw was without a doubt something that didn't come from the technology we have. i am ex military and know that we are not that far advanced.  hovering above the house to the left of us were 2 objects shimmering in the night sky, roughly the size of a transit van and just sitting above one of our neighbours roofs.  they were hovering one on top of the other with around a 4 metres separating them.  they were transparent with very defined v shaped orange shapes in the bottom half, whilst the top halves were see-through. \r\n\r\nif you imagine the moving shape of a kids bubble blowing mixture, how it changes shape but always seems to remain spherical then you get the idea, they were almost organic.  one thing i remember most strongly is although the shape constantly moved the objects had very clearly defined outer walls which were thicker than the rest of the shape.This looked like it was holding the whole thing together, and controlled the shape dimensions.  later on reflection i thought it looked and behaved like liquid mercury.\r\n\r\nwe all stood watching the 2 objects for around 10 minutes (by now 8 of us, 4 adults and 4 children/teens) and the younger ones began to get frightened. we  put the youngest children back into the house and tried to keep looking, not wanting the object to disappear because it was absolutely facinating and i knew that this was a once in a lifetime thing.\r\n\r\nwhilst i watched the object i absolutely got the impression that we were watching them and they were watching us.  after 10 minutes the objects suddenly made a movement as though a switch was flicked they moved to the left in absolute unison and the top sphere took an angle sharper than the bottom and they both shot off into the night sky and disappeared into the stars.  this took a couple of seconds to achieve.  my husband managed to get a photo of them when they took off and they show as v shaped objects with the background of my neighbours house in the shot.  they were spheres at ground level and v shaped rising into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nabsolutely amazing and scary at the same time!\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,
