and then we again disappeared around a corner and into another covered and treed section of road.(we turned off the highway right before that and was on a backway into shady cove oregon. we drove 5 more minutes and rounded a corner and as we went aroung and up the hill, we drove into another open section of road and encountered that blinking object hovering above a powerline next a transistor(i think). as we went aroung the corner we went onto a straight stretch of road very quickly and passed under the object. my brother slammed on his breaks to the jeep(convertible) and we slowed to a halt and barely crossed under the object before we stopped maybe a cars length past the objext as it continued to hover. at first i thought it was a helicopter, then i realised it was dead silent outside other than our vehicle. so i laughed and exclaimed out loua what the hell is it?\".....My brother quickly exclaimed, \" it's a herrier!\"...( a british hovering jet ).....The i responded , \"where is the wind?!!\"...Weboth began top laugh out loud...The craft was only 5-10 feet off the road and 20 feet in the air.....The encounter lasted about 20-30 seconds(just long enough to speak those few sentences to each other) before the object began to rise into the air.It still had the white light with the red and blue blinking...But i couldnt see the actual craft! it was a starlit night and they were out in force! as we passed underneath the object blotted out the star light in the shape of what looked to be a small triangle no larger than our jeep. it was the size of a automobile. it didnt go striaght up..It beghan to slowly rise but mainly wemt away from us to the west north west. as it picked up speed all i could hear was the sound of the object pushing thru the air. like a swoosh against the wind.It started away slowly but within seconds it was traveling at speeds much greater than any aircraft ive seen. and ive seen fighter jets fly!! it was seconds before it hugged the northern rim of the valley and then turned north at incredible speeds and then picked up even more sppen and shot out of sight.It only took abot 5-10 seconds for the object to be totally gone from sight. frpm the slow retreat to the all out radical sppeds,it was less then 10 seconds total time from first retreat until it was totally gone.....Now,ive taken some science courses and i could be convinced of a silent running military craft. klamth air base is close to their for any aircraft. but there is no way to not disturb the air around a hovering object. without newtons 2nd law of equal and opposite actions, we couldnt fly on earth! you have to move mass! wether thats exploding jet fiel or propeller pushing air or whatever other method one might employee, to float you must cause mass x speed of the propellent to exactly equal the mass x speed of the object....Any inequality will result in going up or down in the air. but there are no methods known to man that can cause a craft to hover without disturbing the air around the craft. and as we were almost directly underneath the wind should have been considerable. so they must have employed a method of flight that is as of yet, based on principles that are not commonly (or uncommonly) known...And when it left it evenmtually deperted with great speed that the craft accessed very rapidly. a very fast acceleration! evenm though at first it left us very slowly. i looked at the object with a eye that wasn not completely ignorant. i know it did not fly based on traditional systems we know of. and in hindsight, i realised that i could not see the object very well, nor could i see the field or anything else. i think it shined a light on us! it blocked most of my vision of anyhting else but the immediate area underneath the object. everything was dark! but i should have been able to see it! the white light kept us from seeing very well,and since the rest of the area was still dark i think the light shined directly on us and did not emminate into other immediate areas. i couldnt see 10 feet past the object! everything was dark still and my vision decreased from the light...Yet everything remained dark. im posotive it shined a light, but i didnt pay attention as i was focused on the craft and the situation at hand. we told our parents as soon as wee got home, and that night it was reported by others along with video to the local news!! people up and down interstate 5(north of medford to portland) reported seeing a ufo that night according to local news. we never repoerted seeing it, but we were ;ess than 20 feet from the object everyone seen that night! further, i found it very odd it was so close to the powerline and that transisitor. it was 5 feet from it! right by the transistor!! im not sure, and i doubt it...But maybe the electric company has infirmation abouit unexplained power losses that day. it must have been powering up. there cant be any other reason for it. though it was super odd it chose a location so close to a road were people frequently drive!! always wondered why it didnt find a more remote location. so we seen it 3 times total!! the last time being about 20 feet underneath it and five feet off the road. whats strange too, is i also seen something like this as a young kid. in the woods. except it was different. it was a slow moving fireball! looked like a small red sun!! it even had a tail whipping around like a comet. it was right over the trees and made the trees sway violently! the toips of the trees started shaking like here was a strong wind blowing thru,i seen the bats fly from the tree tops.....Then i seen the red glowing fireball slowly pass overhead. that incident was not very far from where me and my brother seen that floating craft. i never tell people about this stuff, but i guess maybe i shouldnt care...Anyway, thats what i seen.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":62361,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.594981718471686,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01022015-0023","longitude":-122.82171393709801,"occurred":1020150000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1420239772000,"summary":"Seen car sized ufo above poerwline next to the road.

stepped outside to have a smoke on my back deck and i noticed 3 lights that were diagnol flashing like crazy. after realizing that it was't a plane i called my daughter outside to see. neither of us could figure out exactly what it was so we got my camera and i began recording. the object began to move around and change shape. it wound up going lower towards the ground changing to a triangle shape. i had stopped recording by that point and was taking photos. so i do have video footage of it on youtube as well as some photos that i will include in the report. i didn't focus my camera the greatest because i was not sure how long we would be seeing the lights. luckily i had it in a half decent focus so you can get the general idea. i did notice going through the photos that it seemed to be rotating. i am not sure but that is just what it looks like when i go through them in order.By the time i took the last photo the object/objects were already really low and barely visible. i did not see in the photo but it would of been in same area just slightly above the roof of the house. another thing i noticed in the pictures was the green glare on them. i do not know what causes it but i do know that when i take photos of the moon and such sometimes i will see a green circle and such. i think it is a type of glare. but the last photo you could not really see the objects but you can see the green glare perfectly. it was just odd and odd how the objects were in position compared to the glare. usually i would see it in front of the object and not on the side like that.

noticed another identical light then a line of 3 more and then another single and then two more close together then another single all following the same path and making the same turn disappearing over the western horizon 9 all total.  i noticed that as they passed all my neighbors stopped shooting their fireworks which probably meant they were looking at the lights too.  the sky and thin layer

friends so we stayed until 12:00 am. we made it to \"m\"s at 12:30 or so. the house was dark so we were very quiet. i stretched out on the couch and \"s\" went out to the front porch to have a smoke before turning in. he was gone for 3 minutes or so when he quietly came back in and asked me to come outside with him, he wanted to show me something. it was a dark starry night. the porch light was off so it was very dark. he pointed up above a tree across the road and ask me \"what is that\"? hovering just above the tree tops was a brilliant,chrystal or teardrop shaped thing. it was beautiful. like a blue, spinning chrystal. it reflected light as well as had blue flashing lights all over it and it appeared to maybe be spinning. it was big. then he pointed to the south just a block away was another one only smaller. it was 100 feet in the air above our local social security office located a few blocks south on joyce st. then he pointed way up in the sky from north to west to south was 5 transparent things shaped like a childs drawing of a house with the square topped by a triangle. each one was a different color. i remember green, red, yellow, blue and red. they were evenly spaced across the heavens. i thought of sentrys when i saw them. so in a circle of all around above was something. we were the first witnesses. i tried to have a cool head so i decided that since we had had a small amount of alcohol that we needed more witnesses so i ran to \"m\"s room and woke her and \"c\" up.... thru their grumbleing i managed to get them outside. i pointed it all out to them and their mouths fell open. now i noticed 2 neighbors from the house next door due north from \"m\"s place had come outside and were awestruck. \"m\" and \"c\" said they didnt know what they were but they were going back into their house and going back to bed because they didnt want any part of whatever this was.Next i called my mom, its about 1:15 am by this time.I was surprised that she actually answered the phone. i breathlessly told her what was up. she beleived me, ask me what they looked like? then she said to pay attention and she would call me early in the morning when she woke up. she told me to be careful.She then suggested calling the police maybe? hmmmmmm.... i then gave \"d\" a call. he was freaking out because of our talk that very evening about a topic that we had never mentioned to each other in the 15 years that we had been friends. i told him that they were sooo bright that maybe , from 3 miles awy, if he looked to the eastern night sky he might see blue light or to look way up to try and find the colored sentries. i began to notice a gold star that was way up between the two blue things. i thought it might be mars and i marveled at how much light it was still manageing to project in light of the brightness of these things. they were dazzleing. you just couldnt help but to look at them, in awe, as many questions about life elsewhere was being answered in our hearts and minds. i noticed a neighbor man on the south side had come out in his pajamas i think. awe and wonder had all of us talking in hushed tones, no one had their porch light on, offering at least the illusion of antonimity while gazeing from the shadows. \r\n        we didnt speak to any of the others, we all just stared bravely at a miracle. of course it had occurred to me that they were parked just above a private mountain and pasture for cows. they like steak just like we do i think. so i hoped they were just haveing dinner. nothing that beautiful could have bad in tentions. but what were their ultimate intentions for the whole of the neighborhood. at 1:30 or 2:00 am i turned off the gps on my cell phone and then i placed an anonymouse call to the fayetteville police department. the female dispatcher sounded like an older lady. i told her what we were looking at and maybe an officer should come by soon and see for himself. she immediately said \"ma am? what is your location?\" i told her that my location wasnt important here, that if an officer went to the social security office on joyce street and looked up that he would see what is up with no help from anyone. i hung up on her and thats when the first chill went up my spine. what were they really hanging out for so long? their continued presence began to be unnerveing as abduction finally creeped along my thoughts, i had seen a tv show about abduction. i thought about that they say that you dont remember anything after they are done with you soooo... thats a bonus i guess. they bright star suddenly began to grow bigger as it descended from its hideing in plane site position to slowly descend directly down to shine its light on us. it literally shined like a big flash light. i again was amazed and frozen. my instincts kicked in and i wanted the sheltered anonimoty of the dark porch but it was too late. they gold ball seemed to possibly have blinked and it stopped and looked at me... it noticed me and i realized that the night was slipping away, that their agenda was to be carried out in the cover of darkness. there was only a few hours of dark left so if we refused to go to sleep so they could violate us and erase our memories. easy peasy that way. but perhaps they were getting impatient and i had heard that they could grab you up in a beam of light, that the beam of light hurt and that you might remember that! so i backed awy and ddashed into the house to fall asleep quick, i would cooperate. i looked in on my grand daughter asleep in her room and she was fine. the house was totally dark except for the back porch lightshineing into the liveing room thru the glass door, i noticed that the dogs were very quiet out back there. i heard a buzzing and i watched from the couch as the porch light flashed on and off going dim and then bright. i forced my eyes shut. my husband took a place on the floor about10 feet across the room and in front f the fire place.He was positioned with his head faceing west and his feet the east.I was scared.\r\n          one more thing that i need to explain is the very fast, black, flat air craft or ufo that circled the sky right under neath of these things and i had began to notice planes come in from the east flying west. one about every 5 minutes for hours. the flat black thing had a very large, bright red flashing light on top of it. i felt it was issueing a warning of some kind...It paid particular attention to the sentries whom actually climbed in altitude to appear smaller and way, way up there, in the blink of an eye.So i had the impression that our military out in fort chaffee arkansas just 45 miles away had been alerted. but none of the planes paid any attention to the crafts, only the black thing buzzing around with a red light paid any attention.\r\n            so i fell asleep immediately after i watched the buzzing and flashing on and off, dim to bright. i wasnt afraid, i was even curiouse. i awoke from the sensation of being dropped, dropped from a ways up and i landed in a deep crouch right in the middle of \"s\"s chest where i straddled him and pummeled him awake screaming \"\"s\"! wake up!!! we have to kill them! we have to kill them\". i remeber feeling releived when i noticed that the sun was comeing up, the night was finally over. \"s\" was in a completely different position and place on the flooor than when we had passed out. he was 5 feet closer to me than before. no, im not a drama queen. i promise that this is true to the best of my knowledge. the next evening the neighbors all had their chairs outside watching the lights approach from the west just as the night before. i scanned the sky for anymore objects and found nothing. we got in our car and high tailed it back to fort smith arkansas and tried to put it behind us. we aerent harrassed by men in black but we began to get pulled over alot after that.\r\n          we moved into our new apartment in springdale in october 2005. hurricane katrina had just devestated new orleans and another catagory 5 storm called rita was bearing down on my home town freeport texas and galveston texas. katrina hit exactly 14 days or 2 weeks exactly after the event. i have watched many shows about ufos to try and find anyone else with a similar experience with the blue sparkly thing. this is also how i knew that this was big, in comparison to many other sightings mine is phenominal. most sightings are fleeting. the fact that there was so many different types of craft lends to importance i would think. the first week in my new apartment a small blue light parked itself in the southern sky right outside my door. i have sence had 3 other terrorifying ,weird and frightening experiences in the middle of the night. in one experience i wake up , i sit up and look across my bed, across roberts sleeping form at 3little hispanic men. very short. the one in the middle had like a flashlight effect under his chin and his eyes were animal eyes. again i screamed and pummeled roberts unwakeing body, i pummeled his chest in my terror. they were only 3 feet tall.That happened here in my apartment. another time i came too in my liveing room, i was in only panties and i was stumbleing around because my body wouldnt work. my arms and legs were flying around all crazy all on their own and i was paniced and i developed nausea after i got my body tucked into my bed. to this day im terrorfied when i wake up at 3 am or so and i wonder if there is creepy things in the bathroom because i sure need to pee. \r\n           our family had been targeted along with people across the road by huge, bright lights and creepers around the house. when i was growing up we would watch lights out over the texas prairie grow larger, then smaller. they moved around sometimes too. once me and my brother were listening to the radio in moms car in the evcening time, it was dark and starry.  we watched an large triangle shaped craft fly slowly over our house. it was black and it had lights on it. looking back i beleive that we may have seen the then mythical  war creature called th stealth bomber. houston is right up my road after all. nasa and all that stuff. my boyfriend has been keeping his eye on a light that seems to sit up on the hill. it moves around a little bit too.\r\n     thank you for letting me air this out in my mind and heart. there is also many witnesses, oh yea, about the time the gold ball was noticeing me, 2 hours after i called them, a fayetteville police car came creeping aby at 5 miles an hour with his light off. he was right beneath them for a while. his head was trying to sink all the way down in his seat and coast by. there was real possibilty of an attack so a cop with a fire arm would have been welcome, very welcome. i could feel his fear as he went by. he didnt notice or bother anyone standing outside. also this is a long duration sighting. i did develope mrsa a few weeks later.I lost 17 pounds and almost died. my mother did some research on the internet and she called me and said that the blue sparkly thing had been seen over the line in oklahoma. said that it was seen more often when we come our closest to mars ev ery five years. we are also within 60 miles of a rumored underground base and possible ufo crash in spiro oklahoma. thats also the site of some native american mounds, ancient things.My phone number is [phone number removed/cms/tg]. i wish to speak with someone, please.

can. it started when my dad spotted what he thought was a reflection off the new power lines behind my uncle dons new house (fullerton,ca) it was a object that dad was looking at. he got dons binoculars and started watching it close to see what it was, he could not id it. side note: dad was in the af for 28yrs and he flew bombers as well fighters, he flew his own plan until he was 81. he knew it was something other than a plane. don work for the power company as electrical engineer. when dad ask for the binoculars mom and my aunt went out side to see what was going on and they watched it as well. what was over heard by our parents, got me and my cousins headed outside to see what was going on. and this is where it got spooky.... we all looked up and there they were just hovering making no noise, what happened was this; watching the big ship, and then 3 smaller ones showed up out of no where, they hovered for about min then into the big ship, then in ( what i will say, 90 sec ) it had these round ball like things come out faster than you can blink, in a vee shape (6 to 8) then it just vanished leaving a small smoke trail, then it disappeared, like poof!! i can finish with this; i know my dad reported it and was told not to reveal anything about it, he never said any more about it.I can tell you i was scared after that, and i never said anything about it tell now. i would like to know what happened to that report that dad turned in?? all this took place around 1950/1951.
