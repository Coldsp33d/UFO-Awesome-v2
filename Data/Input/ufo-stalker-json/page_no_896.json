at the backside of the house. my brothers called out to me and my mom that a bright light was approaching our house. we lived near o'hara airport so this wasn't unusual but it was the direction of the light that bothered my older brothers. once i reached their room i could see out the back window a very bright light coming towards us from over the tree tops. the light coming towards us had the effect of blacking out the lights below it as it moved forward. my mom had practiced crash drills as we were close to the airport on a routine basis. we all moved to the center hallway and ducked down near the walls. at that moment all our lights were on and the tv and radio as well. when the object moved directly over our house all the electricity when out at the same time. it was at that precise moment that i broke free from my mothers arms and raced to the living room french windows. i remember with extreme detail that the curtains were blown up to the ceiling as i looked up to see the circular shaped craft roar above our house. it had multi colored lights on its bottom side and moved with frictionless speed across the sky in a straight path. the lights on the bottom of the craft were large window like portals that glowed around the edges. its movement was like a boat going across the water but leaving no ripples as it moved. it continued straight forward as it cleared the space above our house until it changed course and shot straight up into space and was gone. it took only two seconds for it to go from flying straight forward to flying straight up into space. i remember clearly seeing the bottom of that craft as it shot upwards into space as it was circular and not spinning or vibrating in any manner. the image was burned into my mind until this very day. that moment changed my life in so many ways. i was diagnosed not too long after that with colored blindness in blue green and grey colors. i was reading at a college level and was put into gifted and talented program by ten years of age. i also began to have weird experiences throughout the years of being watched. also developed a lot of psychic abilities since i was eight years

a smoke. we walked a couple of blocks and went behind a video store. we both layed flat on our back in the grass as we smoked,looking up at the stars. it was night time and the sky was clear as could be. you could see every star in the sky. i saw a plane high in the sky flying a straight path and had a blinking red light. we have at least 3 small airports in 3 different states within about a 10 mile radius from us. i watched the plane for a few seconds then i started looking straight above me at the stars. all of a sudden i saw a light that i thought was a star start moving fast across the sky,i thought \" cool, a shooting star\" it moved fast, in a straight line several feet across the sky which in reality was probably a couple miles in reality because it was so high above us. well it moved several feet across the sky in a second or less, and all of a sudden it stopped. it stayed in one position for a second or 2 and then it instantly moved the same distance and speed across the sky again but this time in a different direction, then it stopped again and stayed still for a second or 2 and took off again but in a different direction this time again. it did this 4 or 5 times. it moved, stop, rested for a second or 2 then took off in a different direction each time, it reminded me of a pin ball, but instead of continually moving as it changed directions it stopped for a second or 2 before it changed directions. after 4or 5 times it stopped, then took off at an unreal speed and completely disappeared. i was completely shocked. this only lasted 30 seconds or so and my friend and i had not said a word to each other. after it disappeared i asked my friend if he had seen that? he said \" you mean that star light that started and stopped moving  several times,changing directions each time then disappearing?\" i said yes, and i'm glad you saw that too. we never really talked about it after that night. since then he moved away and i lost contact with him. i do not know what it was but there is no way it was a shooting star. it was the same color,size and brightness of a star and the light never changed color or got brighter or dimmer.","distance":"Over One

bright orange, circular light traveling north. there is a lot of air traffic here, but the light was not white, nor were there other lights (red, green as expected). the light was constant, and i heard no sound.. i had seen this same thing about 3-4 weeks ago, and since it was unexplainable to me, i called it a \"ufo\". when i told someone about the sighting they asked if it could possibly be one of those chinese lanterns. i hadn't thought of that possibility, so couldn't rule it out. this time i consciously considered that. the pathway was the same, but one problem with that theory was that i live about 120 feet from the river, which is only about 1/4 mile from the long island sound, so it is usually windy here, and comes from the north, traveling south. not always, but the vast majority of the time. i can't recall the wind direction from the 1st sighting, and last night we actually had one of those winds that changed directions,so i'm unsure the effects. what made last nights' sighting even more interesting is that after a second or two a 2nd orange light appeared to be following it at a slightly different elevation. it seemed to catch up to it reaching the same level, and got behind it, because i only saw one light for a spit second. the light was either stationary at that point, or had changed direction, traveling west, where i was standing, facing east. at that point i saw another light coming from the south, followed shortly by 2 others, totaling 5!!! they were identical lights, and in very close proximity to each other. i want to add that from my vantage point there is a house across the street(ese), and a house behind that which is further north. the lights came into my view from behind the house across the street, and over the roof of the house behind that. when all 5 lights were in sight, they seemed to just stop there for at least a couple of minutes. then the lights would just blink off one at a time, randomly. i then called my daughter to tell her, and after about a minute into the conversation, the 1st (or at least most northerly) light blinked back on! the trees were hampering my view, so i walked down my driveway to the road, and by that time the light blinked off again. i forgot to mention that i had grabbed my binoculars by front door within the 1st minute of this sighting, but they're not the best, and the light was the same bright orange, just smaller. no other features were visible. my daughter had suggested getting my camera, but i didn't want to miss anything. i will now keep that by the front door as

standing outside with two of my friends who were smoking cigarettes. i was looking up at the sky like i always do in hope that maybe i'll see something usual, but figured it would be like all the other times and not see anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nat first this is what i saw before trying to process any of this. \r\nit was 4 bird shaped objects in a straight line pointing to my left, separated in between  by bits of the sky, the center of the objects were just white, but towards the edges it would get softer as if they had a glow around them. yet, you could see completely the outline of the objects. it appeared to my right then quickly moved to my left then suddenly gone. \r\n\r\nnow, i've been to this place so many times, looked up at the same sky, seen spot lights, seen air planes, seen helicopters and every single time i could hear the roaring over the music or there would be red or green blinking lights but never moved this fast. the spot lights shoot way too low and are way too big for the size of the objects i saw and not even come close to how vibrant they were, plus there were absolutely no clouds in the sky. now, i've told myself, always be a skeptic before claiming anything, try weighing out all potential possibilities. now my first response was, the spot lights were reflecting off of birds flying in the sky, but that couldn't explain the speed they were traveling at. i give myself the benefit of the doubt and say, they weren't traveling as fast as i might think they were, but still giving myself that from the time they appeared and disappeared it was 10 seconds at the most. honestly, part of me says it was a shorter time span than that. i can still see what i saw in the sky perfectly in my head and thinking about the sizing, i could fit at least two objects within a penny with the space still in between them.  there was no colored lights, none blinking, just a glow around the edges. \r\n\r\nwhen i got home it came across my mind and i tired looking up similar sightings, which brought me to this site. as filling out this whole thing, it made me think about the whole situation in more detail. they could of been triangles such as < < < <  (the spacing in between is actually on point with what i saw) \r\nbut white in the center and the white glow around each separate object.  \r\n\r\nnow honestly, by submitting this, i am hoping someone responds back giving me a logical answer to this whole situation. i want someone to prove me wrong.

thought it was a really bright star, but when i saw it moving i thought it was a plane. it wasn't  until a bunch of little lights started appearing  around it that i thought it was strange enough to mention it to my mom. we ended up pulling over in a parking lot to watch it. we couldn't  believe that no one else was pulling over to do the same. as we sat there watching it we saw that it would start out about the size of a baseball and then it would grow about to the size of a basketball, maybe even a little bigger. then when it was at its biggest   it would stay that size and all these little smaller lights would appear  around it one at a time. then with the smaller lights still around it two lights would come out of the middle one and circle around it really fast then go back into the middle one. then the little lights would disappear  one by one until the middle one was left and then it would get smaller and smaller untill you couldn't see it. after that it would appear a little farther away to the west and repeat the actions that it did before until it got to far away to see it over the trees. my mom decided to take the back way home since it would take us the direction it had gone. we got to a spot where we had clear view of the west and it was really close to a tower near north view  hill. when it got closer it started circling  the tower and after it circled a few times it started moving towards spri2ngfield. that's when mom decided to get home so that we could call my dad who was working in springfield. but by the time we got hold of him and he

december 2014, at 1400, azores time. lajes is on the island of terceira and is the second island from east to west of 9 total. we were flying on a 757 cargo/passenger plane. i sat in the back part of the plane, behind the right wing in seat 3f.  we had just taken off and were about 7 - 10 minutes into our take off to cruising altitude. as i was settling down for the 5 hour trip to the bwi flight terminal, i looked out to my right as we cleared a few clouds and saw a dark trail with no end and a beginning just starting at the 330 position of the plan while flying due nw. it was directly under and to the right of the plane and, at first i thought it was condensation from under the wing but the trail was a dark grey color. i then looked out the window between my seat and the first seat in front of me, then i saw the orb that was shaped as a circle, see thru with a countinual rainbow as the outer rim, with a yellowish glow in the center. i took my droid phone and started to record a video from my window. i then went back to the window in front of mine again to ensure there wasn't a glare that i was recording. i took pictures as i was recording with my phone, but i just got off of holiday with my family so i knew my memory was filling quickly. i stopped after 2 minutes and checked the video to make sure i had recorded something and after going back to my window it was gone, trail and all. i wanted to say something then but i was under a few constraints as we were required to stay seated during take off and i didn't want anyone to think i was crazy. i cant upload the video right now due to its size but im working on getting it a smaller size.\r\nim a sensible person, i just want to know what i've seen. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

flickering like fire in the area of an array of radio towers (which had red lights on them).  at first glance, it appeared the radio towers were taller than he remembered.  on second and third glance, he realized they were not in line with the vertical lights on the towers and realized they were moving.\r\n\r\nhis observation was that they were moving (at this point, there were definitely three) at what appeared to be a slow speed.  apparently, perspective impacted the first perceived speed because as they got closer, they seemed to be moving faster.\r\n\r\nhe came in and asked if i wanted to see the weird lights in the sky. i expected it might be fireworks or that he was joking with me. by the time i was out on the porch, there were definitely four of them. what we both at first thought was the top light on the radio towers turned out to be a fifth object of the same description.\r\n\r\nthe total number of objects seen was five and they passed almost directly overhead. the flicker was more pronounced when they were overhead than it was as they were approaching.\r\n\r\nthey held their course and did not turn, bob around, or stop.  there was no sound associated with their presence.\r\n\r\nthe trajectory was more wsw to ene.  they appeared fairly equally spaced from each other, with the last one seeming to lag a bit further behind.\r\n\r\nshortly after they passed over us, each one individually disappeared at nearly the same point in the sky.  some just blinked out while at least one appeared to fade out as it moved along.\r\n\r\nthe sky was completely clear of any clouds and the orion constellation was very clear.  a meteor was observed after the objects disappeared.  there was no discernible wind at the time.\r\n\r\nthere were no green, white or red lights on these objects as one would expect with a commercial aircraft.\r\n\r\nmy son's feelings were wonder ~ what were these things?  i walked up to the street to look over the house in the direction where they disappeared and they were nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\ni went back inside to watch tv and couldn't shake the feeling that they were still out there somehow.  this could possibly be related to the fact that they just disappeared and i couldn't know they continued on their path.\r\n\r\ni am fascinated at the broomall, pa sighting (on your website) of the same day and approximate time since broomall is a good sixty miles southeast of our location and that report seems to be of the same or similar objects.\r\n\r\ni've checked a few local news outlets online and have found nothing similar. i feel others are most likely to have observed this also because people are often outside after midnight on december 31/january 1, so i won't be surprised to learn of other reports.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

watching tv i see a big solid round  red light over the house behind us. i often see planes on approach to cuyahoga country airport but those are heading east to west and the red aircraft lights are flashing red and much smaller than what i was seeing. i had no idea what these were as i'd never seen anything in the sky lighted this large. i got up and walked to our sliding patio door for  closer look, i then see another one coming approximately 200 yards following the exact same south to north route, i immediately go outside to watch them, as they're almost overhead i look to the south and see three more following the exact same route and spacing, i yell for my wife to come out and she see's the last 3 as they silently went overhead and to the north following the exact same route. i run back inside, grab the phone then go back out and call 911, i explain what i saw and they said they had no reports or explanation. they were always in level flight and i'd guess between 500-2,000 feet in elevation. to approximate the size i'd say if an aircraft  marker light looks the size of a bb these would be the size of a quarter. we watched them all until they went out of sight over the house's and tree's across the street to our north. i'm not saying these were aliens but would love to know what they were, definitely not a plane or helicopter! i'm only sorry that in the excitement of seeing this i never thought to grab my ipod from it's charger to take a video of this.
