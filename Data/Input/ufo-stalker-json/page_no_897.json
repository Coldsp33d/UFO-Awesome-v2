and at precisely 12:00 midnight the whole estate was a  buzz with excited screams as people started shouting \"happy new year\" ,i live on the top floor of my apartment which faces the west of nairobi and gives me an interrupted panoramic view of the western and north western nairobi skyline  so i peeped outside my widow to look down at the commotion of the exited residents ushering in the new year and stood their for roughly 3 minutes when something caught my eye to my right about 45 degrees to the horizon and from where i was at 2 o'clock position, at first i thought it was an aircraft as it was glowing reddish and moving in a straight line , i turned and tracked its movement when i then noticed it wasn't flashing like an aircraft's strobe lights but was a constant reddish glow which kind of dimmed and then went brighter without going off , the object just moved in a straight line before abruptly quickly making a 90 degree turn and zooming off at a very high speed and vanishing out of sight.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

observed this light as it left it's hovering position and moved south at an extremely fast speed. to my knowledge at the time mankind had nothing that could move that fast not even a missile. in just a matter of a couple of seconds it was out of sight. we stood there wondering what in the world it could have been when it reappeared moving south to north and as it approached the location where i first saw it, it suddenly did a 90 degree turn to the west and kept going in the direction toward macon where warner robbins air force is located. there was at the time a russian ship tied up at a pier in savannah supposedly for some types of emergency repairs. i wasn't convinced that it was just a coincidence that that ship just happened to be there at the same. i immediately contacted hunter air force base located in savannah and told by the duty officer that there had been no radar detection and the same at warner robbins. not satisfied with that i then called and spoke with the on-duty officer at norad at cheyenne mountain and told the same thing. no radar contact detected!!! i have never believed that and until now i have not spoken of it since that night. i could be trusted with a top secret clearance and work on this country's first line of defense against nuclear attack namely fleet ballistic missile submarines but i couldn't be believed when i reported these sightings to the

clear-puffy clouds with our digital camera, a scenery over the atlantic ocean, the minute we decided to conserved battery power and shutting the camera off, at least one or two minutes after, we both witness a tringular-dome shape silvery ufo spacecraft lifted up from the atlantic ocean and hovered next to our twa flight to puerto rico.  once it lifted up, it stayed hovering next to our aircraft for about 5 or 6 minutes, then it moved at a straight forward speed to probaly i would say 100 to 200 feet but staying next to the twa aircraft.  once this thing was hovering next to our plane, i stood up with my seatbelt strapped, and looked around to see if someone had there windows opened but i guess we were the only ones, next i looked to my right side passenger, but then again, everyone was to bussy reading newspaper and books. i wanted to confirmed this with one of the flight attendents but unfortunately, they seemed to be in the kitchen i guess cleaning and organizing before decending.  so while my partner was still looking, the ufo kind of sped away towards upward into space at an incredible speed, something we have never in our lives have seen before.  i figure i would tell one of the flight attendents but i was to way shock what we saw, thinking that maybe i would sound to them to crazy.  but, till this day, i still think and wonder that we, we are not alone in this planet, to me, they have been here and living here under our own noses.  i wish i could draw here what we saw so you'll have a preety good idea of the shap and colors it represented that

paralized almost nightly since childhood and have seen glimpses of being escorted out of my bedroom someone /something on each arm, sexual attacks and coersions , giants, round clouds of lights, which could only be described as ufo's. it woke me up as usual.

time i have seen this. i was out having a smoke when i saw an orange pulsating light about 1000 to 1500 feet in the air. i then watched as it went from the area from the pandhandle of florida the north west to the area around tampa from my self and then a couple of right angle moves and then disappeared going toward mcdill air force base to the south west of my self it went too fast for any normal plane or any thing like that unless we had one single fighter jet that can go faster then any thing i have seen in awhile . it changed direction a couple of times while moving at a very high rate of speed and then it just seemed to disappear in the direction of the base i have mentioned. i have seen these objects a few times before in this area going close to the same area. i have seen a lot of objects that i just can not explain and this really bothers me a lot. i am an ex military person and i worked on helicopters. i can tell the difference between different planes and helicopters and this is not any thing i have seen in awhile and the color of the lights are just to bright and are to bright . i don't se any thing in orangeish red or colors like that and it was really moving from about a 200 to 400 mile's ion a blink of an eye this is too fast for something that i know of that we have that they tell us about any way. i see these lights and objects a lot and in the last couple of years living in this area i have seen things that would make your skin crawl and i can not explain them. this really bothers me that there are things out there like this and the government does not say any thing about what they are or if they are even ours. i think they owe us an explination about what these objects are or if they are even ours. i know we can take it we are not cave men we can handle it so tell us what is going on . i want to know >","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with
