remains some kind of draw or location for visits from other life forms and one of the most interesting aspects is the mining under the volcano going on at night.....\r\n\r\nafter working on it for several months, i ran into two local tribal members, mikaela kolb from the rincon reservation and her boyfriend kyle from the la jolla reservation, who both swore there are underground explosions at night....I was skeptial of this story until it happened while i was on the south grade of the volcano on july 20th during an amazing sunset when i was at 3000 ft, the mountain belched and released energy that blasted up thru and made the clouds overhead look like fish vertabrae...This took place about 8;30 pm and i did not notice the evidence until i moved the photos i was taking over to my laptop......\r\n\r\ni have collected thousands of rocks that have been blasted off from underneath like popcorn, that are not normal geological activity. some of them i find kilometers from where they were part of the volcano....\r\n\r\nso i moved up to the same location that was paradise gardens in the 1950's that is oak knoll now and when i was wide awake watching the stars on sept 16th, an apache helicopter came roaring up the valley from the south at 10:00 pm and it was perfectly clear enough to see it at about 3000 ft or so and it was chasing this speeding ball of light energy, that playfully stalled in mid flight as if to let the copter catch up, and then it sped off at supersonic speed without making a sound in a directly level horizontal flight path to the north, leaving the copter far behind.....\r\n\r\nso if you are aware of any mineral connection to all of this, maybe we can discuss it with some who are while i am here from indonesia....I will make another trip over to arizona in order to spend a bit more time and if possible would like to meet and hear your experiences with this amazing mineral and how it has been used thru the centuries in the object you have.\r\n\r\nthank you for your consideration and enjoy the holidays...\r\n\r\nrespectfully & truthfully yours","distance":"501 Feet - 1

sightings in rhode island that week that were also in the local paper.\r\ni was outside in my back yard with my two children. son(5)daughter(3). i was swinging them on the swing set when i first noticed the object. it was quite far in the distance, just a black dot. (planes flew over our house often, so at first i thought nothing of it. but what caught my attention was how it suddenly moved way off to the side at a strange angle. but it still kept coming closer in my direction. i continued watching and realized then...This was unidentifiable. it moved like nothing we have here, and as it got closer i realized just how *huge* it was. bigger then 2 football fields. it was massive. it appeared to have what i think was windows all around its circular edge. it was round,rather flat shaped with a very, very slight dome shape on top. it's speed at that time was consistent and not too fast. i could see it perfectly. as did my children. i'm not good with distance but i would say it came within a 1/2 mile to us. it moved impossibly amazing. it dipped at an angle and changed direction. it flew into the cloud and back out. flew 'around' the cloud and at an angle back towards us. it hovered. it went up/down/sideways. it reflected the sun on it's top/bottom as it moved. it almost appeared to be giving a show! i was screaming for my neighbors to come out. but \"strangely\" i was not fearful at all. i was beside myself with excitement actually! i did not want to move or go to get anyone because i didn't want to miss any of what i was seeing. the object kept up the display above me for about 10 full minutes when suddenly i heard helicopters. three green(army) helicopters came into view from my left. the object dipped and dove down at an angle and then up to the right in the blink of a second______it was gone!!  \r\ni ran into the house and called the police- because i didn't know what else to do. i then went back outside and the army copters were still flying (back and forth). they saw it. i am certain of this. the police came and i reported what i had seen. the officers took it comically and i was angered by them. they also went around and questioned the neighbors. at this point- and i have no idea if this is even relevant- (but it sure was to me),the old woman who lived in back of me, (our yards were back to back separated by a stone wall)she came out and called me over wanting to know what was happening. i just told her i had called because i saw something strange in the sky. she then looked at me and said * oh' you mean about all those colored lights in the yard last night?!\"* i went numb. this woman knew everything that went on. i said \"what colored lights?\" she then said that [the lights woke her and she went to her back door and there were all these colored lights moving over the back yard. she went and woke her husband who saw them too. they opened the door to go out but the lights suddenly were gone.]i called one of the officers over to take her statement too! __ about a week later i was visited by a gentlemen from the rhode island institute of paranormal and ufo investigations. he audio taped my account and my sons account seperately. (my daughter was too young). he also had us draw pictures for him. \r\nthis account was reported and documented. there were also other sightings within that week that were reported and in the local paper. one of them which happen only 3 days from mine in which two young men in exeter had an object come down extremely close to them in their truck. it (melted) the fog lights on the truck.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":62247,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.7051477,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12312014-0004","longitude":-71.5303857,"occurred":484642800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Rhode Island","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1420029610000,"summary":"It was round, almost flat (like a quarter) with what appeared to be windows all around it's edge. it was metalic, it was impossibly fast, it was huge!

dump hole to throw away a \"slop pail\" they used to call it.\r\nfrom the house to dump hole was about 100yrds.We were half ways when she looked up and said what is that?I looked up and this is what i seen!A v shaped object flying real slow no sound and red lights from tip to tip we stood watching it fly east ward for a few minutes then my sister said i never seen a plane that close before but that was very slow though that was strange .So that was that,i was about 10 yrs old when that happened.8 or 9 yrs later my brother and a friend of mine went out night hunting just north of my home.It was about 11pm ,we were spot lighting in very big paster that is situated on our reserve.We drove slow along a trail, a little more south of the paster.I was driving a small station wagon my brother and my friend were sitting out of the windows with a spot light and a rifle.We drove almost to end of the paster when over the trees a bright light came on and brightned up the whole field.My brother and friend slipped back in to the vehicle and said \"what the hell is that\"i stopped the vehicle and my brother said shut off the motor!We sat for a few seconds and light came back on over the trees cause it had shut off too when i shut my motor off.My brother said what is that?It\"s too quite to be a helecopter.He said let\"s get out of here!I started up the swagon\r\n and turned around and headed back where we came from.As we were driving away my friend said it\"s following us and all of a sudden it flew right by us on the south side over the trees.My brother then told me to pull in this one opening in trees it was kind of a hill and said shut off the motor.We parked and we could see the thing in the sky.It was a ways out but we seen it go up, go down, go left then flew away north.And also another iccident about 10 yrs ago with 5 witnesses i am 46yrs old\r\n \r\n","distance":"101-500

stationary in the sky with a what looked like the tail section of a airplane but straight up and down and not slanted as in a airplane.  at first it appeared to be moving toward me above the two story building about a block away, above all overhead wires.  it made no sound.  it began to sort of bounce up and down and stayed still.  i backed up not taking my eyes off of it and reached into my house and grabbed my binoculars near the entrance of my house and took another look with the binoculars and the surface seemed to have ridges on it.  the shape was the same.  after about 2 or 3 minutes it began to move in a northerly direction and seemed to float downward until it was out of sight.  i was alone so i don't know if anyone else saw it.  it seemed solid metal and had no lights.   it was about 5:15 to 5:20pm and the sun was going down but it was still light.  i could not believe my eyes.  i wondered if it was a kite, it was not aerodynamic in anyway that i could imagine.  i was a flight attendant for nearly 25 years for an international airline and have never seen such a sight in all of my flying years.  it seemed like a heard a clicking sound before i stepped out of my house and it was very noticeable when i opened the door because it always look up into sky when i go out.  i was very excited to see such a sight and happy because, i always wanted to see a ufo.
