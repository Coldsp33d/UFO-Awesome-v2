 well i stayed inside the building working and pondering on what had happened but still did not tell anyone.  when i had to take a sample to the lab about 8 hours later, (9 pm roughly after this happened) i headed towards the lab facing in the westward direction, i could see the object in the field area. i stopped my cart and sat there looking at it again and talking out loud to myself.  i went in the lab and delivered my sample came outside and it was still there. so i sat and observed it for a few minutes and motioned with my hands pointing at it that i still see u like earlier.  after i did that it started moving towards me again from the west on to a east postion. well this really scared me and i took off in my cart and went back to my building and this time i told my coworker.  she said that maybe it was a drone. i told her at least 10 feet wide?  the public can only get like 17 inches wide.  i talked to her for about 15 minutes and decided to go to the south door and see if i could see it still and there it was.  so i called my coworker over who called her husband over and all three of us observed the flickering light just hovering  about i guess less than 1000 feet from the ground.  well now it's time to go home at 630 a.M. and i'm in my truck heading home and i believe it's the same object that i was observing as when i got to my house. so i hurried up and got my camera with a 600 mm lens and started snapping pictures. my son in law came out briefly and seen the light i was snapping pictures of.I took about 10 pictures and a short video although i didn't have it stationary so the light bounced around alot. went inside to go to bed and get ready for work when i wake up.  so now it's dec 25 at night and i'm off to work about 530 pm. i sit in my truck facing north in the parking lot and i notice a light again further away than yesterday night but was still in the east direction and heading towards the fairy crossing in galveston. i went inside and kept thinking is this aliens, a spy drone, a military drone and does my work know anything about this. i didn't see it anymore after that but i did get some good pictures. i have a video but its on my computer not on my phone i am doing this information on. that's it. just want to know is it alien?   it must not had intentions of hurting me cause it did interact by my motions and it came from me pointing at it.  also on the bottom side of this object i did not see any landing gear. the surface seemed very glossy and smooth underneath with nothing breaking the line of the smoothness. (the plane) completely flat like a counter top.  please respond back to me.

this out to my mom, who could now also see it. since this object was cloaked it was hard to see the exact shape, but it appeared to be a classic saucer shape with some kind of \"tenticle\" (this is in quotes because i really can't tell what this arm like apparatus was). at first i did just assume it was the cloud but at further inspection my mother and i could see that this was some kind of cloaked ufo. it appeared to be still and after 5 solid minutes of observation it took off. given that this object was pretty much invisible, it was impossible to tell whuch direction it was going or how fast

(and it's a very cold night here.)  i noticed the object immediately.  i was aware of no planets that should/could have been in that position, so it seemed odd enough for me to grab the camera.  \r\n\r\nit was a large round light, sitting stationary below the moon and well above the horizon.  i watched it for about 1 minute, completely still/hovering, then went to get camera.  i moved out onto the patio off the adjoining room (to south) and began taking pictures.  as soon as i began taking photos, the object began moving rapidly due south.  the speed seemed faster than an commercial jet, but no more than twice as fast.  more like 75% faster.  \r\n\r\nthe light appeared to become smaller as soon as it began moving, but the size and shape didn't change thereafter as it moved.  it moved due south along the lakeshore above summerland, in the direction of penticton, where there's an airport, then went out of sight.  it did not descend.  \r\n\r\nthe object appeared round the entire time, but in the last frame photo it looks different -- elongated and with two smaller lights, one on either end.  i had zoomed the camera at that point, too, which probably accounts for the shape change.  \r\n\r\nin the first photo the moon looks quite full, but it's not… just ½ half full tonight.  so the camera seems to have made the images look rounder than they were.  \r\n\r\ni conclude this was a \"ufo\" because of the large size and length of time while hovering, then the rapid movement and simultaneous decrease in size.  no airplane, helicopter or satellite could do that, to my knowledge.  \r\n\r\nthe photo name for ufo 003.Jpg is a different naming convention than the others because i saved a copy, turning it 90 degrees for my viewing.. but i'm sending you the original instead.  the others i re-named so i could view them all together on an .Html page on my desktop.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":62226,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.573014946737786,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-12302014-0008","longitude":-119.58813980073153,"occurred":1419926400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"British Columbia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1419943273000,"summary":"A large round light sat stationary for 1 minute, then began moving across sky and disappeared from view.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62226_submitter_file1__ufo001.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62226_submitter_file2__ufo002.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62226_submitter_file3__UFO003.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62226_submitter_file4__ufo004.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62226_submitter_file5__ufo005.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/62226_submitter_file6__ufo006.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"V0H1N0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Naramata, British Columbia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:72690"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"New York","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Was close and mistaken for a plane (i live near an airport) but it sat for 20 minutes until i realized something wasnt right. i looked back out the window and  i saw it sitting but higher and slightly smaller. woke up my boyfriend and he confirmed i was not crazy, we both watched it erratically shift up anr over, and left then right, then up again. all the while pulsating a red and blue light in what seemed to look like moving in a circle. watched it until it became cloudy and lost sight of it. the size  grew smaller as it flew further away, i'd say i saw it fly low (i mistook it for a plane) until i saw it sitting at 75% smaller than originally seen for 20 minutes, and gradually and erratically flew away until it was out of sight  (cloudy) in 20 minutes.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

triangular was very slowly passing overhead. i was an avid aircraft model builder and several things struck me as very odd about what i was observing. first, the object appeared to be lower than any aircraft i had previously observed at that location because it seemed to stretch from directly over my head, over the church and to at least the house on the corner of 1st avenue sw and 5th st sw. second, it appeared to be flat, dark black in color and was a solid object. as it passed overhead it blocked out starlight. third, it did not have any aircraft identification lights. i remember seeing a bluish light near my point of view, and a reddish light towards the far side, but no blinking lights or white landing lights that one would expect from a low-flying aircraft. and fourth, as the object slowly passed overhead, it made no noise (which should rule out a helicopter or propeller-powered aircraft) and after it passed overhead there was no sound whatsoever nor was there any visible means of propulsion (i.E. no rocket flame or engine glow). the object continued heading slowly east-southeast over waukon. i've never seen anything like it before or since.","distance":"101-500
