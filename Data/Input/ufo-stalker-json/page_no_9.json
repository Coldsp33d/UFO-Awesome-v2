south in about 80º above the horizon. some flashes were with less power than others, but the white light was pure an very clean. the object seemed like taking photographs of the area. the distance was not more than ~3000 -

between the hours of 2p-4p waiting for a friend of hers to come. we were talking amongst ourselves when out of no where suddenly this very loud roaring sound like the blow dryer from a carwash but 20xs louder enveloped my truck. i didn't i understand where it was coming from as i looked out the back window looking for someone. i turned to my friend and asked her what is that noise why is it so loud. she didn't know either. my truck was shaking and i thought the windows were going to pop. this went on a few minutes. we're looking at each other dumb founded. \r\n  the next thing to occur totally twisted my mind. i'm not sure what made us look up thru the front of my windshield but as we did this thing that could only be called a craft slowly drifted or cruised in complete silence no sound at all over my truck. we were in total shock by what we were witnessing and just how very close to my truck it was. i was going thru my head ruling out what it was not. i'm asking my friend do u see this what is it what are we looking at omg what is it. the size the triangle shape us looking up underneath it seeing these violet lights that outlined the shape of the craft with blueish circles within them. i thought i was seeing things. i was nervous a little scared and excited all rolled up in one. i couldn't believe my eyes. i knew it wasn't man made cause the was no propulsion no thrusters of any kind and how slow it glided over us and in front of us. i stated who or what is flying that. we just sat there staring looking at it in aww. it was black triangle shaped massive and thick like. at the back of it was a single white light that was real bright. after it was a distance from us it suddenly took off at a speed that was out of this world and then it took a quick right turn it was so fast that it disrupted the atmosphere to where it left a trail that could be seen it was like waves. i asked my friend did that thing just turn right she stated yes. i said we cant do that.  it then turned back straight and proceeded to fly over the valley going north so very fast and i recall all that i could see was that one bright light in the back of it of it and how when it ascended in the sky it reminded me of looking like a star as it was just starting to get dark. during this whole neither one of us thought to grab our phone to take a pic or record the event. we were literally in pure astonishment and aww of what we were looking at. never i once did it even pop in our heads. we kept our eyes on the craft the entire time. not knowing if it would stop or even come back. we stayed in the truck the entire time kind of fearing who was inside what was inside. i even asked my friend if we had been here in the truck the whole time. my whole perception of things and life itself changed that day and i will never forget it. i find so odd though how it was in the daytime that this event occurred and i can't recall if others were around us in the parking lot or even if there was any traffic at all being it was the day after christmas. what still bothers me the most is how low it was flying and why was it hovering over my truck for the time it did and what was that loud noise about. what was it doing up above me..

stars etc etc. so i saw it approaching and i heard my neighbor outside talking on his deck. i called out to him to come take a look. at this stage the object was directly over our properties. his partner had come outside at this stage and she also witnessed it. it appeared to be a dull grey metallic sphere that pulsated a brilliant white light at random intervals. i have seen these appear out of nothing in the night sky many times but this time it was really close and it was seen by 2 of my good friends who up to this point were quite skeptical about these kinds of things. we just watched this thing hover/fly over our houses in amazement to which i said to my friends \"i told you i seen em\" it just carried on a straight path on its east path until it was no longer visible to us. i call em 'sparklers' because thats what they do. like i said, i have seen em at great distance before at night, but this time it was just getting a lil dark at dusk when it came the closest i have ever seen for the 1st time. on the 26/03/2018 which was last night i saw another object appear out of nothing in a clear night sky also. this one was an orange colored half circle that appeared and

in 2003.  i live in a quiet neighborhood on a secondary type road, maybe about 16 ft wide. the driveway to my house forms a letter “t” with an intersecting street that ends looking at my driveway. in other words i live on the top of the t looking down the vertical line that makes up the body. \r\n   early one morning, sometime around february or early march approximately 6:30 to 6:45 am, i walked out into my driveway to get something from my car. i could see down the side street in front of me. there was a big orb like circle just above the tree line.  i watched as the orb moved slowly and silently towards me. it stopped directly over the house across the street from me. this is about a 2000 sq. foot house and the orb was about 80% in size of the width of the house, i’m guessing about 35 ft. wide. being almost a perfect circle, i would estimate it to be of equal height as width. \r\n   i was for some reason not the least bit nervous or scared, just the opposite, i was quite curious. i walked across the street to get a better view and observe this orb from the back.  the light from the orb was very diffused, it was a light onto itself but was not putting light out onto the surrounding environment. as i approached the house from the left side, putting the orb to my right, i could see the outer right rim of the orb but it was not observable from behind.  there only appeared to be sky.  i realized that there must be something that was blocking my vision of the orb from this angle but there was nothing.  i came to the conclusion it must be something perfectly camouflaged with the sky. \r\n then i saw it.  approximately 40 ft behind the orb and slightly lower there was a backwards “l” shaped pipe hanging in mid-air! i could plainly see the pipe as i was standing almost underneath it; it was about 10 inches in diameter and bent at a 37 degree angle. for the life of me, i don’t know how i knew, but i knew that i knew it was 37 degrees and for some reason that was significant.  i'm not great at math, and not the least bit interested in engineering, but for some reason i couldn’t get the angle of the pipe out of my head. \r\n   it was now that i knew whatever i was looking at was perfectly camouflaged, except for this pipe that appeared to be hanging in mid-air (it was also perfectly silent). i stood there looking at it for another 30-45 seconds then began to walk up to it, so as to stand directly under it.  as i did there was a loud noise, which sounded exactly like the loud frazzling sound a transformer makes when it blows. sparks then flew off the pipe and it began it move upwards very slowly for 1 second then shot straight up. it was completely gone out of sight within 2-3 seconds.  the orb and the pipe moved in unison together, meaning that they were indeed all part of the same thing, even though i could not see what connected them.  \r\n   i was left with two thoughts: i said to myself, “what cheap technology for an alien ufo” and the compelling thought of the 37 degree pipe.  \r\nnote: the total event took place in about 1 ½ to 2 minutes. i did not experience any missing time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n

scared but not terribly, felt a sense of wonder even though their eyes seemed to be smiling and laughing at me. i was shifting around so i wasn't paralyzed. one was short; about three and half feet(about my height at the time), the other was tall-maybe six feet. i looked at them for awhile before the little one pinched me in the ass(yes, i know how that could be construed.) and i ran

i was taking out the garbage at about 9pm last monday night. it was maybe at least a mile up and a bit to the west (toward the hudson river), but nearly straight up. it appeared they were fixed to the wing of an airplane maybe as in a slight v shape so i am reporting it as one object. there were about 7 tiny red lights. it was completely stationary and silent. the only apparently stationary things i have ever seen in the sky aside from astronomical bodies were helicopters that sometimes hover very loudly over some incident taking place on the ground. the lights were twinkling as a faint star would. they have to be pretty far way to twinkle. for example the lights on the world trade center (a few miles south) twinkle as viewed from 26th street and 5th avenue. the lights were about as bright as the little red lights on a crane would be high above a city street (more dim than bright) so i checked carefully to see if this was something like that. but clearly no cranes visible. the weird thing was it was a little windy and that thing was yet as still as if fixed to something solid. i went inside to get my binoculars but couldn't find them and i decided, due to ambient lighting, i would not get a very good picture of it. in retrospect i suppose i should have tried to. but i did check to see if it was still there and it was. but then about a half hour later it was not there. i also waited to see if there were any reports of a ufo but there were none. anyway, that is what i saw and it is possible it may not have been widely noticed, or even noticed by anyone as being strange. i don't know. the lights were faint and far away and quiet. but i am reporting it because i couldn't figure out what it was. maybe someone else saw something similar, or can explain what that

danger and foreboding and a gut feeling of bad intentions from there appearances.I have an urge to return to the locations from where i took the stones as i believe that something will manifest from the visit. i am not now in good health, but the urge or calling is consistent. \r\n i believe the following to be true and is written without prejudice.\r\ni do not want publicity or money, but have submitted this info for its value in research that needs to be done for the international security\r\nof mankind who i believe are under risk from maybe all alien and ufos. we are losing our security shield- beware of social engineering as some amongst us have an agenda of self preservation at the expense of the majority. the ufo/aliens do not like us but like our home planet. it has resources including us who can be used as we are, or altered to suite applications of use as deemed appropriate for their use. they intervene in worldly affairs to keep us busy with what is essentially trivia, diversions away from what we really should be focused on.  \r\ni maybe totally wrong but i maybe totally right -
