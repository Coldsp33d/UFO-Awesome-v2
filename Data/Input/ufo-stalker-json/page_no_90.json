each on it's belly in the three corners of this triangular craft.  they softly pulsed a warm yellow light/glow.  i was the driver, but i couldn't keep my eyes off it.. it's like time stopped only because we watched it for minutes while driving but never made it down the road. i still can't figure that out. the crafts surface didn't appear smooth, it looked to have detail that i couldn't make anything of.  it was dusk and the sky had just began to go from glowing sunset, to evening light and the vehicle began to move, after our seeing only maybe 3 minutes of actual hovering.  it moved extremely slow for what seemed to me like forever. the three of us just kept asking each other if they were seeing the same thing as each other.  we were blown away to say the least. life changing.\r\nsoundlessly and very smoothly began to pick up pace on it's south eastern course of flight. the craft seem to shrink and then in a blink it was very small, and we realized it had taken off so fast that to us it appeared to shrink, we watch it until it disappears into a point on the horizon some 20 miles se of it's straight path of flight. i had pencil and a spiral notebook in my vehicle and i right away sketched the craft as i had seen it as it was hovering. both my friends agree that my drawing was exactly what they had seen to. we were very quiet for a while in the car

viewed at about 40 degrees in the sky to the north.  appeared as a black line with slightly curved edges. not to read into it, but my first thought was this is the black line that could separate the top and bottom of a flying disc. disc was not visible though. did not move as normal aircraft, but moved very slowly, sometimes stationary. i also thought that perhaps it was one of those long balloons that clowns twist into animal shapes, but the line did not undulate with the wind, and also did not move as fast as a balloon or in one direction. also it was visible behind clouds that appeared to be very high in the sky, which made me think it was quite large. the black line slowly rotated from horizontal to angled to vertical, which made me rule out a drone which typically has to fly so that it's fans are parallel to the ground. from my vantage point, it moved first to the w slightly then up and to the n/ne getting smaller and smaller until it seemed to be disappearing behind cloud cover.  then it moved slightly closer and started to move ne/e and down below tree line. it was lost behind the tree line about 9:10/9:15am. there were two times where the line slowly transitioned to a red/orange color and then back to black as if the angle it was rotating caught the sun's reflection. i was in the car so i could not hear a sound. it never landed.  i took a couple photos and a short video. it should have been close enough to the pease airport radar to be picked up.

north conway from visiting my uncle. i was 16 at the time maybe 17, i was riding the front passenger seat of my father's vehicle. as we traveled up the hill to go towards interlakes school i noticed to my left about 500 feet above the treeline which was about a football field length away from the road a white floating object in the air. i pointed it out to my father and my father jokingly i said maybe it's a ufo. but as we looked on we noticed that the object was making odd terms at fast speeds. my father slow to polly about 15 to 20 miles an hour in a 35 mile an hour zone cuz i'm assuming he was starting to think it was a ufo. as we slowed the object seem to stop darting around. we sat there on that stretch of road doing 15 to 20 miles an hour for a good 2 to 3 minutes until it's shot up into the air. the following night my mother and i are traveling home from shopping at the local grocery market raven mcintyre circle, as we pass below the bridge to the bypass i noticed a glowing object above the treeline, it seems directly beside the water tower, but i could tell it was further back i pointed out to my mother and she paid no mind to it. the next night my girlfriend stay the night her and i we're arguing pretty heavily before we went to bed. i remember this part the most cuz i remember being hot in my bedroom and we were both sleeping on a twin size bed that was next to the wall next to a window. i remember talking myself up against the wall purposely not trying to have contact with her because the way she was acting that night. i remember waking up around 12:30 a.M. and cracking the window no more than an inch because it was hot. at the time my father had a dog that was a one-person owner he was it one hundred percent dedicated to my father and didn't like anybody else in the family very noisy and very nippy, very protective. if i walk to the bathroom that dog which was a chihuahua would start barking its head  come running out of my father and my mother's room which was next to the room, you would have to slam the door shut before he bit at your ankles. my father and my mother are very very very light sleepers my girlfriend at the time was it very very very light sleeper. i am a light sleeper. my girlfriend i awoke at 310 a.M. my clock was right there on the nightstand first thing i noticed when i awoke. my girlfriend walk at the same exact time. she told me close the window because it's cold in here. i told her you close it you're next to the window. it took a few seconds then we both realized at the same time that we were different spots in the bed. the thing is she never slept next to the window cuz she was always cold. both of us could figure out how we swap spots. i got up and i went to my father's room as soon as i open my bedroom door which is on the opposite side of the house from my father's an mothers room i could hear the family dog barking his head off and running down the hallway. after shoving him aside i went to my parents room which they where already awke and ask them if they heard my girlfriend or i get out of bed to use the bathroom(basically asked if the dog woke them up or heard someone in bathroom because the walls are extremely thin literaly). they both said no they didn't hear nothing,the dog,the door, or the toilet. my girlfriend an i went trying to figure out how we ended up in different spot in a twin size bed without waking each other until we fell back to sleep. the next to days was the weirdest... why they were so weird was because i thought nothing of them until over a year almost 2 yrs later. the next night i remember waking, when i woke i was facing my clock an i remember the time saying 310 am. almost instantly i round over to face the window, i pulled back the curtain and in the window it was a giant ball of light that covered the entire upper window. i remember clear as day saying to my self an d out loud \"oh...It's just the moon.\" i closed the curtain roled over an went back to sleep. the very next night i awoke an i was facing my alarm clock an again it said 310 am. i again instantaneously roled over pulled back the again an there that same giant ball of light in the upper window... an for the second time i remember saying to my self an out load \"oh...It's just the moon.\" then i roled back over an went to sleep. both time when i actually though about when i realized what happened, i can remember what i said was light not me saying it. i mean it was my voice but it felt like it was pre-recorded an i was just listening to it. i know i said the words cause i can remember feeling my mouth move. it was almost like someone or something had control over my body an i was just the passenger. cause even rolling over an going back to sleep didn't feel like i was the one that actusally was doing it. ever since i've realized that all these things are linked ive had trouble sleeping at night. like right i filling out this at 4-5 am.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then
