approaching springbank airport which is located west of calgary. approaching from the north i was approximately 10 miles north of cochrane flying parallel to and a couple miles west of  highway 22 and descending through 8500' above sea level or about 4500 ' above the ground. it was a bright sunny morning and i was just looking at the scenery when i spotted a black object along the highway maybe 2 miles ahead of me that was moving fast northbound ( towards me). after looking at it for a few seconds i thought i would time it along the section lines on the ground and calculate a speed of this very fast car. within a few seconds i  realized that what i thought was going to be a corvette in fact  was a  flat black colored tubular object that was flying low level over the highway. it was cigar shaped and not flying with the end of the cigar pointing forward but perpendicular with the long edge in the direction of flight. as i was flying south at some 230  knots and the object was coming towards me the whole encounter happened fast but fortunately i was getting closer and could get a better look at the craft. as i came abeam the object it was wider than the road and difficult to estimate the height, but probably within a couple hundred feet of the ground. then maybe stranger than actually seeing this object as it was nearest my position directly off my left wingtip it vanished within 1/2 a second. it quickly turned translucent where i could see a blurred image of the field and road through it while it had a darker edge along the outline of the craft. the object very quickly appeared clearer and within a fraction of a second it  disappeared from view. i had no idea what i had seen and scanned the area around the track the object was flying thinking maybe it was the top of a wing of a pipeline patrol aircraft that i had seen and that maybe the aircraft banked and i lost sight of it. scanning the area it never reappeared. i looked at the tcas (traffic collision avoidance system ) display in the cockpit that shows all the aircraft that are being interrogated by atc radar in the area and although there were many other aircraft to the south and west  there was nothing on the display near me. looking back towards where i last saw the object i noticed cars on the road heading south and this helped judge the size and speed of the object compared to a \"known ground based object\". the cars were both much smaller and slower than the object and were within a mile of it when it disappeared.  the drivers may have seen the same phenomena. i estimate the object as between 50 -80 feet in length and 15-20 feet wide.  it moved on a steady track and at a constant speed. i mentally timed it at crossing a half mile in under 12 seconds or around 160 mph a speed not particularly fast for a small airplane but faster than what patrol aircraft use when flying low level. there were no discernible markings, windows, lights, or other features. just a flat black rectangular cigar shaped object. the entire encounter was at the most 30 seconds long as the closing speed on the object was in the neighborhood of 400 mph. there were several passengers on the aircraft but they were concentrating on a conversation in the aircraft, i doubt anyone saw the object and i didn't ask as i enjoy my job. likewise as the object never showed on my tcas, there wasn't much point in asking atc if they noticed anything.  besides it had disappeared at that point.\r\n\r\non a side note, as a pilot with 30 years of experience i have seen sights and objects which i could always dismiss as meteors, cloud formations, atmospheric phenomena such as inversions, other aircraft, satellites, etc. even if this object had kept its track i may have been passed off as some type of uav, however as i witnessed from a relatively close range the disappearance of the object i have no doubt it was something that is either cutting edge top secret military tech or something that i have no explanation of.

mare island, the northern end of the san francisco bay, and parts of marin county across the bay.  \r\non the evening of dec. 15, 2014 at approximately 9:15 to 9:30 i was sitting in the front room watching tv.  from a nearby window i happened to notice a light moving slowly across the sky.  at first i paid no attention because helicopters and planes are ubiquitous in the sf bay area.  then it occurred to me that this object did not have the blinking lights that are on all planes and helicopters.  it was just a round orange glow moving across the sky like some iridescent pumpkin.  i got up and went outside onto the front deck.  as soon as i got outside it became apparent that there were more than just one of them.   following behind the first one came another one and then another one and then another one and then more of them.  there was a high overcast but beneath the clouds visibility was clear.  i ran back into the house and got my wife to come and see.  when we got back outside there were even more of them.  the spacing between them seemed to be about equal distance (maybe 1/4 mile).  they first appeared out over san pablo bay which is the northern end of san francisco bay.  they were moving slowly in single file from south to north and disappeared behind trees beyond my view.  they went in and out of cloud cover and when they were in cloud cover they reflected a brilliant orange glow off the clouds.  i've tried to come up with a descriptive analogy and here is the best i could do.  as they past through he clouds they looked like a campfire glowing in the distance on a pitch black night.  \r\ni don't know how many there were because i don't know if the first one i saw was the beginning of this procession or somewhere in the middle.   suffice it

allã­. cuando regresã© esta persona ya no estaba pero la luz seguã­a allã­, parã© el coche en el cruce y bajã©. la luz era blanca y la tenã­a a la altura de mis ojos y a unos 4km y la veã­a de grande como un plato de comer, yo buscaba referencias para asimilar el tamaã±o y le puedo asegurar que era enorme, esa zona es un marjal y hay una visibilidad inmejorable. estuve al menos 10 minutos mirã¡ndola, con los bellos de punta, sin poder comprender lo que estaba viendo y con unas ganas locas de montarme al coche y acercarme y coger el mã³vil para llamar al 112 (los mã³viles todavã­a no tenã­an cã¡mara), pero al mismo tiempo no querã­a quitar la vista porque temã­a  que en ese momento desapareciese sin saber cã³mo. empecã© a darme cuenta de ciertos detalles, como que la luz no reflejaba no desprendã­a luminaria, con lo grande que era tenã­a que haber iluminado toda la sierra, y como podã­a estar eso ahã­ con lo grande que era y suspendido en el aire y no hacer nada de ruido si cualquier aviã³n que pasa o helicã³ptero se oye una barbaridad, incluso los coches de la autopista (que por cierto no pasã³ ni uno).   cuando por fin decidã­ mentalmente subir al coche pero sin llegar a moverme, la luz empezã³ a cambiar de color y moverse lentamente como si vibrara y al mismo tiempo empezã³ como a darse la vuelta, y fue entonces cuando se apreciã³ perfectamente lo que era ( en ese momento tuve una explosiã³n interna de adrenalina que empezã³ a subirme desde la punta de los pies hasta la cabeza, y se me pusieron los pelos de punta), era impresionante no podã­a creerme lo que estaba viendo, no tenã­a capacidad de raciocinio para entenderlo, no me querã­a sugestionar ni sacar conclusiones precipitadas, simplemente no me querã­a perder detalle de lo que realmente estaba viendo. al pricipio solo veã­a una luz blanca circular que no reflejaba luz flotando  hasta que en un momento dado esa luz empezo a cambiar a un color amarillo rojizo y entonces es cuando al rededor de la luz empezã³ a verse un anillo enorme y destellar luces de todos los colores y desacerse el camuflage ( la luz solo era el centro) y realmente fuã© en ese momento cuando apreciã© lo que era !!Una nave espacial enormeâ¡â¡  vã­ lo que en el argot llaman una nave nodriza, yo he calculado por referencias del terreno que tenã­a aprox. unos 200.000 metros cuadrados o lo que es lo mismo 500m diã¡metro. la nave estaba en vertical ( como una moneda de canto ) y empezã³ a girar sobre su eje y se puso en horizontal, no podã­a creer lo que estaba viendo, era enorme y se estaba moviendo como flotando y sin hacer ruido. estaba viendo con mucha nitidez las ventanitas de colores que tenã­a en el anillo central, al poco tiempo empezã³ abrirse  una compuerta en un lateral de la nave ( como si se desvaneciera el fuselaje) y vi el interior de la nave aunque debido a la luz interior muy potente no podã­a apreciar bien su interior, al momento empezaron  a ascender del suelo unas luces que llegaron a ser seis esferas  que debido a la luz que desprendã­an no terminaba de ver bien su forma, una vez que todas estubieron alineadas dieron una vuelta alrededor de la nave y en formaciã³n empezaron a entrar al interior de la nave una tras otra, cuando terminaron se cerrã³ la puerta y la nave empezo como a vibrar, se desplazã³ lentamente hacia la izquierda y hacia arriba y de repente con una aceleraciã³n increible hacia la derecha saliã³ de la atmosfera terrestre ( como en una catapulta), en un momento pasã³ a ser un punto blanco en el cielo que empezã³ hacer ziczacs y alinearse con las estrellas, y poco a poco el puntito desaparecã³ en el firmamento. la percepciã³n del tiempo no la tengo muy clara porque no estuve controlando el reloj, pero se ala hora que salã­ de casa y a la hora que lleguã©,por lo que he deducido que estube obsevando mã­nimo 30-35minutos.\r\nsubã­ al coche y me dirigã­ a casa, no me crucã© con nadie ni siquiera el rato que estuve en el cruce mirando, cuanto mã¡s me acercaba a corbera mã¡s me daba cuenta lo grande y lo enorme que era lo que habã­a visto. cuando lleguã© a casa mi mujer embarazada de mi hija estaba durmiendo y le intentã© comentar que habã­a visto algo pero ella me dijo que me acostara y que maã±ana ya hablarã­amos. al dã­a siguiente me acordaba de todo pero no podã­a concretar detalles como que no me lo querã­a creer e intentaba buscar explicaciones, incluso he estado unos aã±os como si se me hubiera olvidado, incluso me planteã© cuando empecã© a recordar la posibilidad de ir a que me hicieran una sesiã³n de imnosis para saber realmente si lo que me venã­a a la mente en flases era real o me lo estaba inventando, hasta que poco a poco he ido asimilã¡ndolo y recordando hasta el mã¡s mã­nimo detalle, y por muy inverosã­mil, raro, increã­ble... que le parezca ahora estoy convencido totalmente de lo que vi, se lo que vi y no tengo la menor duda. se de gente de la zona que tambien ha visto en el mismo sitio y en ã©poca diferente.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

co. in late oct. or early nov. 2014. this was sometime in the daytime, probably in the afternoon, clear skies and full sun. we noticed at about 45 degrees to our right, just over south table mountain and to the east of the feature called castle rock, a totally stationary object in the sky. i remember it as being a light silver color and my brother remembers white, but still close. we both agree it was perfectly spherical and probably about 20-30 feet in diameter if it was at the distance we thought, somewhere over s. table mountain. i think my brother saw it first and said something like \" what is that?\". we briefly discussed what we each saw and agreed we saw the same thing. we watched this for about 30 seconds until the stoplight turned green and we turned left and lost sight of it. it appeared to be only a few degrees above the mountain, maybe 100-200 ft. altitude if it was at the distance assumed. if it was much further away, of course it would have been much larger and higher in altitude. upon discussing it later, we both agreed it probably was not a weather or hot air balloon because it was perfectly round and had nothing hanging underneath it. obviously planes, helicopters, the moon, venus and other celestial objects can be ruled out as this was full daylight. since it was motionless and nothing happened, i kind of forgot about it until i happened across a video on youtube called the crestone ufo of oct. 3 2014. they (2) appear to be almost the same thing we saw, only they have a darker appearing center, making them appear concave. ours appeared totally spherical. then i found several other videos of very similar things in breckenridge (filmed by a tv station) and around pueblo reservoir (i think) at around the same time as our sighting. i wish i had reported this earlier so i could better remember the date and exact time, but i do recall this was after the tv report which i had missed when it aired.","distance":"Over One

wife and i went out onto our side porch to smoke a cigarette. my wife was sitting in the chair on the right side of the porch, i was standing on the left side of the porch facing the street.\r\n   when i go out to smoke i always have a habit of looking up to the sky. during the day it's usually to look at the clouds and the clear blue sky. at nighttime i always enjoy looking at the stars and the planet's if there are any visible. i was standing next to my wife discussing the days events, after all it was christmas day. i did what i always do, that is turn around, face the street and lean over the rail to get a better view of the night sky. i was looking to see if jupiter had peeked over the horizon in the southeastern sky. it was still too early and i did not see jupiter at that time. as i scanned the heavens above, another very bright object caught my eye. the first thing that got my attention was the brightness of the object, the second thing that caught my eye was when i noticed that it wasn't a star or planet because it was moving.\r\n   well, my first impression was that it was a star or planet. until i noticed that it was moving. my second impression was that it was an airliner, small plane or a helicopter. i ruled these out for several reasons. first, there were no red or green navigation lights located on the wing tips. secondly, there were no anti-collision beacon lights that should have been colored a reddish orange and had a flashing effect on the bottom of the fuselage. thirdly, there were no high-intensity strobe lights that should've been located on each wing tip. these lights would have been bright white flashing lights. if the object had been an airliner, small plane or a helicopter it was surly low enough to have made a jet engine or helicopter rotor sound. but it was absolutely silent. besides i think it was too high to have been a helicopter. the other possible object that i thought it could've been was a satellite or the international space station. however, this was not a possibility due to the fact that it looked as if it was flying below cloud level. and it was extremely bright. i've seen satellites fly across the horizon, they have always been a lot dimmer and fly across the heavens much faster.\r\n   i first noticed the object almost directly over my head. it was moving from a northwest to a southeast direction. it moved in a straight flight path and seemed to have reduced speed for a few seconds and then it looked as if it had sped back up to or beyond the speed it was traveling when i first caught sight of the object. i watched the object for approximately 15 - 20 seconds. i don't believe the object ever moved vertically during the time that i observed it moving across the sky.\r\n   my first reaction was one of puzzlement. since the object was flying at what seemed to be below cloud level, the lack of any sounds coming from it and the fact that it was extremely bright kind of threw me back for a second. after going through all of the possibilities that would've made sense and coming to the determination that this was not an airplane or a helicopter, my mind felt a little strange and i felt like i had an emptiness in my gut. its the kind of feeling you get when you can't explain a situation with basic logic or facts. however, a few seconds after coming to this conclusion it became less of a puzzlement and i became more intrigued. it amazes me how so many thoughts your mind can produce in a few seconds. after the entire incident i was still quite puzzled. my brain was attempting to make sense out of something that it couldn't register as a normal event. at the same time i wanted to do everything possible to figure out what had transpired. for the rest of the evening, christmas night, all the way up to today, i am still very intrigued about the event. i have visited several websites checking to see if anyone else in my neighborhood or in my general area had seen the object that i saw that night.\r\n   i wanted to explain how i lost sight of the object for the last paragraph. anyway, as i was watching the object fly from a slight northwest to a southeast direction for approximately 15 - 20 seconds, in a straight flight path. the object was almost traveling from the west to the east. suddenly, flying across the horizon from a southern to a northern direction, another object came into view. however, there is no mistaking what this object was in the distance. it had the red and green navigation lights, the flashing reddish orange anti-collision lights and it had the flashing white high-intensity strobe lights. this object was moving at a high rate of speed, fast enough to realize that it could not have been a commercial airliner or a helicopter. and even though this object was farther away i could most definitely hear the roar of the jet engines. as the slower bright object flew toward the southwest, and the faster object was flying toward the north, i could see both of them in the distance. as the faster object moved fairly close to the slower object the most puzzling event took place. the slower object simply vanished. the object simply looked as if it blinked out of existence. it looked as if the faster object had changed its direction after the disappearance of the slow bright object. i think the fighter went from flying north, to flying in the same southeastern direction the other object was traveling before it disappeared.\r\n   i am by no means an expert on military aircraft. nor am i an expert on unidentified flying objects. however, i do have enough common sense and the eyes and the ears to realize that what i was experience was not normal. the way the bright unidentified flying object looked as it flew overhead, without making a sound was an event i have never experienced. and the feeling i got throughout my body was one i rarely experience. it was a strange but cool experience. \r\n   thank you for taking the time to read the details of my experience. and if someone in northwest baltimore county experienced the same event, on 12/25/2014, please leave a reply.
