around my birthday.  i had gone up to a buddy's place to hang out with him and his family.  they were inside the house, and i had stepped outside to smoke.  i was standing in his back yard out in the country.  i looked up, and saw a grey object that was \"bell\" shaped somewhat hovering above and over the neighbors property.  it was round, and looked like a giant bell. it was a clear day with no clouds out,  at first i thought it may have been a blimp or hot air balloon, but realized quickly that it was not.  it made no noise what so ever, and had no visible lights which i could see.  the only noise i could hear was a little but of local traffic coming from a nearby state highway.  the object was grey, and had dark circles going around it, which i believe are windows.  i could not see any markings on it, and could not see any standard aircraft lights on it (the blinky ones).  \r\n\r\nthe object which i saw was already proceeding slowly overhead in a southern/ southwestern direction.  if i had seen it while it was directly above me, it would have only been about 200ft above me (+/-).  however i only saw it when it was over the neighbors property close to their driveway.  \r\n\r\ni only saw it for maybe 3-4 minutes at most.  i was near the back door to my buddys house, and i opened the door, and said \"hey, there is a ufo out here\"  i had said it in kind of a soft, almost unbelievable tone, because at the time, and still do, do not beleive in ufos.   \r\n\r\nmy buddy mike, heard me, while his brother and his brothers wife remained inside the house.  mike came outside, and stood near me, and i pointed at the bell shaped object which was still moving in a southern direction.  i asked mike \"do you see it?  what is it?\"  he responded that he did not know.  the object went over top the trees crossed over the state route and could not be seen due to trees obstructing our view of the object.  mike has come out, and maybe only saw it for about a minute or two.  \r\n\r\nthe only reason im reporting it now, is that i was watching tv and saw a show in which nazi scientists had a similar shaped object on it.  but unlike the one pictured on tv, this had dark \"windows\" going around it and was grey/silver in color.  the one on tv looked much smaller than what i had seen, the one i saw looked between 30-40ft across, and maybe 20 ft high.  i could draw

front and to the left of where we sleep is a window. it is about 5 feet above floor level and measures about five feet across by one foot up and down. i looked up from my puzzle to think. my eyes were attracted to  a couple of lights through the window. they were both whiteish and for a second i thought they were stars. but they were far too bright and too big to be stars. the one on the left was the largest and brightest and was several times the size and brightness of a star. it was even a few times the size of venus in the sky. the one on the right was a little smaller and dimmer and appeared to be a fraction lower in the sky. the lights did not seem to move at all. by thinking about the position of these lights within the frame of the window, i estimated that these lights were almost exactly west of where i was sitting. after just two or three seconds a third light appeared. it was slightly closer to the left of the brighter light. this third one moved. it seemed to move away from my position, a little to the right in a big dipper sort of movement, starting to go a little down then scoop upwards. it was two coloured. the central part was yellow and the edges were red. it went through my mind that it was a sort of flame pushing this third light away. within two seconds all the lights went out. that was it. i spent much of the night looking, but to no avail. my wife

the air ,she said yes . as soon as we noticed that the trees were making a cracking sound something like being bent by stress. i started to look for the sound then she starts screaming and crawling towards her house , parents came out ,because of her screaming. both of the had seen it ,drug her to the house and was yelling at me to come now. i was close to the corner by then witch was 4 homes away. i could see that it was longer than the whole block. silent except for the buzz. traveling at walking speed for 2 to 3 more blocks. i was yelling at it and thrown a rock up at it. i was shocked wen it didn't hit it and came back down faster than i threw it , no contact. it was a dull dark grey/black with what looked like a intricate computer board pattern. three red lights at each corner lit up , it was moving at walking speed the accelerated out of sight faster than i could slap my hands together. it was heading straight towards our air force base. i call them to report the incident the dispatcher said 6 other reports had been made. i was contacted by a person from washington state said his name was sargent  patterson. i was informed to draw a picture of the craft with details and time as well size shape and markings. he made it clear that it wasn't ours on manovurs and to not speak of it to anyone. i lived about a five min drive from their house my mother called to check on me when i left and i went straight home, just to find out i had been gone for 45min. i don't recall anytime missing or events. i did drive straight home very fast , so i thought. to this day her parents wont speak to me about it and my ex is still so afraid to recall it accept to say yes she was so scared. i have had many other incidents that have been ongoing to this day . many other shapes and sizes , my children have witnessed many of them with me. i have detailed , what could only explain as engineering blueprints as a result of that on particular happening. i drew them up and took them to our wichita st. university aerospace professor , he said \"we do not teach anything anything like this if you are correct i need to speak with environmental ,as well as the biological study professors. i did they all seemed to know i was bothered by this . all told me thers nothing like what im describing offerd as classes , i should write a book on my ideas and submit them\", i took it as if they thought i was a little crazy. to this day it is burnt into my mind like some sort of plan for my to act on . i don't know why ive decided to share with you at this time except the overwhelming desire to not feel so alone in ,what it seems like a strong desire to finaly see , and feel like these patterns are being witnessed by anyone else. its around us all in everyday life , and in my personal opinion so simple why are not creating this. im sorry, it seem so vague , but to start explain that part would be not apart of the detailed description of the ufo ,more of an after affect. i have so much mre to share , if this peaks your interest i would love to show and share this with the people who are in the particular fields of interest . thank you for being here ,if it wasn't for my daughter and son pushing me i probably wouldn't have taken this step. p.S. my entire family has been witness to ,what we can only describe as a small pale person who happens to have the ability to move in and out of one space into another , it has happened only a few times but they were all in the same room when that occurred. this was many years after the original event happened.There's about thirty years of this kind of thing to share. i would love to finally get it out.   thanks for being here for me to share my experiences .

in 2014. \r\nmy first sighting was around 230 am i was in my balcony, which over looks the neighborhood when i saw a single orb, basketball sized appear about 8 feet off the ground 3 house's down. it then started to move slowly threw some trees, following the path of some fences. the object would go in and out of sight covered by vegetation (it had a light but it would not light up any thing around it) it reached the last house which was only separated me and it by an ally about 15 feet wide. it lowered it self below a 5 foot fence only to emerge now being 3 orbs in a triangle formation now only less then 20 feet away, my mother joined me at this point to see it as it moved between some branches in a tree and dispersed.                                                                  the second time was in july 2014 which actually had a string of events. the sighting happened exactly at 3:36 as me and my girl friend slept we where awaken by a feeling of being watched as we looked out a window my girl friend first saw an orb backing up about 40 or so once i had sight of the object i saw was seemed to be a blimp like object. it only resembled it in shape about 4 feet long it hovered at about 20 feet off the ground and moved west. it appearance was a translucent orange, salmon color at what appeared to be the bottom-front of the object was an inner sphere which was a yellow hue yet still slightly translucent the object just moved along and closed the window and went to sleep.\r\nthis was followed by a few stuff till now at one point a had an inner voice tell me while in sleep dont be scared its okay i awoke to tell my gf just that and and while saying that my laptop turned on by its self.\r\nmy gf experienced lights out side her window followed by a low pressure which made all her blinds fall. i will occasionally wake up to an emanating light in to my room, lighting up my wall, i will then see this and the light immediately goes away.\r\nmy mom had also seen the lights from our balcony once before and my aunt was scared by bouncing lights in the hood of her car years earlier.         i would willingly submit sketches up on request, i just have never made any yet.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

things happen i couldn't sleep.  i went outside and took a picture and this naked thing that was on the side of the house at about the same place where i found a footprint in case #54367.  the image in the picture was almost naked except for what looked like a head scarf and had thick lips and a very crooked nose.\r\n\r\ni was sleeping on the night of 10/21/14 and awoke on 10/22 with burns on both arms from my middle knuckles to about 3” below my elbows.  the burns were on top of my hands and on top of my forearms.  i did nothing the day before that would have caused this.  it hurt pretty bad.\r\n\r\non sunday 11/09 at 10:05 i was in bed and hadn’t quite gone to sleep yet when i heard my name called.  \r\n\r\n11/12 the cuckoo clock by our bedroom door and a battery operated clock in the guest room quit operating at the same time 9:05 p.M.\r\n\r\nthis past sunday 11/16 ron (my husband) couldn’t sleep.  he said have you heard the noises in the house.  i told him that i don’t pay attention any to them any more.  the house makes a hell of a racket.  the kitties are on the bed and we can see them stare at particular areas.  they are scared stiff.  there is banging, and crashing, as if something is jumping off a table or countertop.  i said to ron “and it is only at night”.  he said “yes” then he checked himself and said “when you’re gone it has happened too”.   he said that “there have been loud booms it’s as if the house is sliding off its foundation.  i can’t tell where it’s coming from.”  it’s like something is tearing the whole place apart.”  i hate to be up especially at midnight to 1:00 a.M. but then again it can happen all the way until a little after 4:00 a.M.  the rocking chair carries on with  various noises. i purchased it in a 2nd hand store.  i can hear a banging on my jewelry box, etc.  this doesn’t happen all of the time though.\r\n\r\n11/21/14  i went to bed early.  the master bath is on my left side.  the light turned on by itself at 9:24 p.M.\r\n\r\ni am enclosing a photo of the naked person and a sketch of what i see on the photo using my program and taking down the midtones and blowing it up.\r\n\r\ni'm throwing in an extra photo when i panned the area.  i don't know what the red in the area is or the four white dots.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,
