i-64,as i was approaching the interchange, saw a bright light hovering or moving slowly in the distance. although it was beginning to get dark, there was plenty of late, bright sunshine. the only clouds were much higher than the object. the object had a luminous trail behind it of about 20-50 feet. when it eventually passed thru some small clouds i could still see the light it generated.\r\n as i began heading north up i-64 the object moved toward edwardsville. i was driving 45-50 mph and it was parallel to me. it then slowed down and started moving towards georgetown. i took a back road to try and get under it for a better view. when i did so i could faintly see some kind of structure with the aura/glow coming from behind it. then, it started to fade as it approached georgetown proper.. in 20-30 seconds it gradually faded to nothing, while still moving. at the same time i heard sirens. i entered onto sr 62 and first responder vehicles were arriving from both directions and shut down the road. twice i saw a first responder run across the road, up an embankment and went into the area of an abandoned golf course. to me, they were looking for something. finally, my car and two before me were allowed to continue. what was surprising to me, was that the vehicles looked like fire trucks, but were move like large, all-terrain vehicles. also, when i passed this pass-thru area there was no auto accident scene, no sign of fire, nor injured parties. also no ambulance or stretchers. no police were there. this was just a few minutes. after the object slowly disappeared/faded out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

just finished towing a boeing 757 from the west side of san francisco international airport back to the terminal. as i was walking under the right main wing and had just passed the intake of the number two engine, walking towards the tip of the wing, i spotted my coworker. he asked me what time it was and i looked at my watch and in a british accent i said, “zero, zero, twenty-three.” \r\nhe then had walked off toward my left as i continued toward the rear of the aircraft. ahead of me was terminal 2, which were filled with parked narrowbody aircraft. the air was cool outside and as i had been walking under the right wing (and just passing the trailing edge) i breathed out a few deep breaths and noticed my breath. i had thought to myself, “goodness, i guess the winter is coming quite quickly. it’s going to be cold at nights before i know it!” then after looking a little less than strait up, something caught my eye passing from right to left (about 50 – 70 degrees up). there were three faintly glowing lights  (fainter than the stars, but still bright enough to be noticed, and they had visible light auras around them, but no bigger than the lights themselves) moving in a wedge formation; the first light leading and the other two following, but all moving at the same rate. they were visible for about 3 – 4 seconds total. \r\nthey seemed to have a downward curving trajectory. the first thing i said to myself was, “hey, it’s a new stealth, military fighter jet!” then while i was observing them, they joined up into what seemed like one light and i then said to myself, “no s**t! . . . it’s a ufo!” right after they had joined up, i quickly pulled out my iphone and attempted to set it to video mode, but i had lost sight of them by then. i then glanced at my watch and it said 00:26. my mouth then hung open wide and i walked about face towards my workers as they were removing chocks from the supertug that we had just used to tow one of our aircraft.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

standing in my driveway, facing east, throwing the ball for my dogs after work.  glanced up at sky (clear, mostly cloudless night, stars visible but only faintly as was still not long after sunset) and saw object.  noticed it because i had never seen anything like it, and while there are routinely airplanes in the area, this did not resemble an airplane (and lights did not flash, nor was the object moving steadily in a path like an airplane, and they aren't generally in that direction - from my property, i often see the commercial airliners moving north of me from the east to the west where yvr is).  it did not appear to be a helicopter either though shape was difficult to determine as it was pulsing.  it mainly hovered, but appeared to be moving very slowly toward the north ... it looked like it was either enormous and really far away or kind of close, and not quite so enormous - it's difficult to say.  it looked to be about a 20 minute drive away in terms of distance (if i could have driven straight at it), but that kind of estimation is really not my strong suit (i should note that in that direction/area is the langley air field, but it sure didn't look like anything else that comes from that area!!).  watched it for about a minute or more, then looked away to throw the ball for my dog - looked back up and the object had vanished.  watched sky for another minute or so, saw no reappearance of object or any further activity.  glanced up periodically for the next 20 minutes or so, but saw nothing else unusual in the sky.  time was about 5:42pm when object disappeared when i took my eyes off it.  \r\n\r\nhow did i feel?  really creeped out, because i was making fun of the show \"alien files unsealed\" the night before, as i'm not a \"believer.\"  but i really don't know what the object was.  it was not really an orb and not really a diamond shape - something in between.  it was so bright and pulsing, so difficult to determine exactly. i wish i'd

first picture was in taipei, taiwan (i'm american) that i was on a trip with my significant other, sister and brother in law. did not see this at the time the photo was taken.\r\n\r\nthe taipei one we were at the national palace museum, right outside of the entrance and was simply enjoying the view. upon returning home found an unidentified flying object in picture. picture was taken september 30th, 2014. should be around 2 or 3 pm taipei time. \r\n\r\nsecond picture was just last week, december 20th, 2014 while i was in aruba with my fiancee. took that picture right before checking out of the hotel. wanted to capture the views one last time before we went back home. this was taken on the balcony of our hotel room. did not see that object in any other pictures before or after that snapshot. again, like in taipei, did not notice anything during the time i took the picture but only after taking the picture, while reviewing photos, i saw a tiny speck in that photo on my phone. i thought it was dirt or maybe a scratch on my phone's screen, when i could not clean that spot, i zoomed in to see something that looks like a ufo.\r\n\r\nonly notable feelings that was out of place was the day before, i woke up really early for no particular reason, could not sleep and went out on the balcony and while looking out at the ocean, had a strange urge like the ocean/beach was calling to me so i must go out to it. was so strange that i found it stupidly corny and even laughed out loud at the notion of \"it's calling out to me.\"\r\n\r\nit is worth mentioning because i absolutely hate the sun, heat and beach, only went to aruba because my significant other works in the hotel industry and had 5 nights free at the hotel. i did end up going to the beach by myself as my significant other was sick and asleep, early in the morning about 7/8 am. i am usually a vain person but had such a strong urge to get out there, ended up not even doing my usual meticulous routine of skincare and make up and just went to the beach to look at the views. nothing strange happened there but i guess it's worthy of mention since the urge to get out there, in a way where i feel i must do it so soon, disregarding my vanity and all, was unusual particularly for me, personally.\r\n\r\ni'm sending these photos as i'm curious as to what mufon thinks they are and hopefully, my honest preference and hope is that they'd be disproved as ufos and are possibly other everyday objects.","distance":"Unknown, N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

from work. i noticed that it was a clear night and that a number of stars were visible. i noticed a light in the sky and presumed that it was a satellite from the speed and way that it was moving. it was star-like but a little bigger/brighter. it seemed to travel exactly how a satellite would travel from the south west for about a minute before it came to a complete halt at, approximately, 60 degrees. the light stayed in this position, close to a star that i used for reference, for roughly fifteen minutes. during this time i managed to take a number of photographs with my smartphone. \r\n\r\nthe light then began moving again, this time quicker than before, in a different direction. i would expect a satellite to travel in a straight line i.E. from south west to north east, but the light started to move directly east from it's position above the star. i stepped out into the street from my driveway and watched as the light quickly moved towards the horizon. from observing other satellites i expected the light to fade into the night sky but i could still observe it for a further thirty seconds or so before i lost sight of it behind woodland on the horizon.\r\n\r\nplease see

had to urinate.  as i was doing this i gazed at the dark sky.  i was standing about a hundred fifty feet away from the fire.  i was looking to the southeast when a glowing blue orb with a flat bottom

stationary and glowed for several seconds then the light blinked off.  a few seconds later the light blinked on again fairly close to its previous location but a little further to the west and slightly higher in the sky.  it stayed on for only about one second and then blinked off again.  i did not see it again.  i immediately suspected it to be a ufo because it did not resemble anything

disappearing with cloud subterfuge, and many deciding to pass directly overhead, after hovering, with absolutely no sound and no vapor trails. i have seen this before, but never as profusely as this time!  also, yet again, i've become aware of at least one black helicopter, dimly flanked toward the rear by one small light, perimeter pacing the area, giving the objects a w_i_d_e berth. i had been

(like in the diagram above, however this craft was a bit more elongated than depicted.) the craft was completely silent and in no way appeared to be aerodynamic. as you can see in the diagram, both the front and back of the craft were completely flat.  there were grayish/white circles underneath the black craft and was in view long enough, to be able to count the number of circles. perhaps they were lights that were not illuminated. the craft was in view for about 15 seconds until it disappeared passed the trees next to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nthis was the first of two of these types of crafts i have seen. i am reporting the other one as well.

swamp/refuge, and it passed directly over where we were ufo hunting on the boardwalk the night before. again, it was silent and flying very close to the ground at a low altitude. how the heck can a craft so large do that?! the sides/edges of the triangular craft were lit up with orangish/red lights and it had a larger orangish/red light in the very center of the triangle. some of the lights were blinking while others were solid. as it approached the town it turned parallel with the length of the town and its lights started to turn off one by one. my friend and i literally ran down main st.

went out ufo hunting in our town one last night for the remainder of the year. the two ufo hunting outings that were within the past week were successful as there has been a lot of strange ufo activity going on right now. on friday, december 12, for 40 minutes in the swamp/refuge that borders town, we watched a black triangle with orangish/red lights hovering and flying around. the following night on saturday, december 13, for 5 minutes and with two other witnesses we watched a pair of orangish/red orbs off in the distance just past the swamp/refuge. as soon as we got to the observation hotspot, i noticed a pair of orangish/red orbs flying above the trees through the swamp forest. i just wanted to stay there for a minute and observe it to see what it did, not go chasing after it. we walked out on the boardwalk and i immediately noticed just on the other side of the river two sets of orangish/red orbs were flying from the north to the south. i then look over to my left again to see if i could still spot the one pair of orbs through the trees and i could no longer see it. again i just wanted to wait and watch from there to see what would happen, but my friend was leaving me behind to head into the swamp. i was starting to get upset and even more scared. as soon as i stepped into the tree coverage of the swamp i saw several orangish/red orbs flying and hovering around above the tree line and i was unable to keep my eye on them the entire time. my friend was telling me to hurry so that we can get to our usual filming spot to set up the camera equipment. i immediately call my best friend on the phone just to keep me in the moment and so that he would be there in case anything happened. we finally make it out to the filming spot where we have a good view, i still have my friend on my phone, my heart is racing, i'm shaking and i look behind me and above the tree line of the swamp are so many orangish/red orbs flying and hovering around that i was unable to count and watch them all at once. on the other side of me was the river and where the two sets of orbs were located when we first started out. because i was trying to keep my eye on the many orbs above the swamp that were a whole lot closer, i was unable to tell if the others were still there. so i'm trying to set up my tripod and camera to get this on video and i still have my friend on the phone talking to him. the orbs then started flying towards us and over the river. when the orbs were the closest to us as they were flying over the river, with still being on the phone with my friend, my phone went to complete static and then my call was dropped. i didn't put this together until later, but while a dropped call can happen occasionally if one is in a bad spot, what was so strange was the correlation between the static sound just before the dropped call as the ufo was flying nearly overhead. i didn't try to use my phone until much later that night, but when the call dropped with that static sound that it did, it caught me off guard.\r\n\r\ntuesday night is the 5th time that we have seen ufo activity over the swamp/refuge bordering town and it was definitely the scariest ufo hunting night because there was so much orb activity all around us. again, these orbs were flying very-very low just above the tree tops, large, silent and would hover. i have spotted the black triangles and the orangish/red orbs now enough times that i have a pretty good idea of some of their characteristics, which include; change from orangish/red color to white,  a light/orb may blink while another or others stay solid, tend to turn lights off one by one; sometimes you will see three lights of the triangle and can see a very distinct triangular shape and then the craft will make the slightest move and you'll only be able to observe two lights. there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the way the lights are changing from orangish/red to white, three (or many) to two to one, and solid to blinking. in fact, knowing this is one of the best ways to spot a ufo and then of course being in an area that has a lot of activity like where we are. i just want to add on here, that i haven't been interested in this stuff until i recently started spotting these strange things in the sky, just for the record.","distance":"101-500
