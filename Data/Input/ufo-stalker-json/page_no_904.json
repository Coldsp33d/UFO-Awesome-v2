wend down to our electric boat on the lake to talk and i went to take the dishes inside.  when i came out i went down to my boat where my son and his girlfriend were sitting.  he immediately said dad we called for you we saw a ufo moving around overhead from the north to the south and it was blinking on and off.  i am a private pilot and a retired electronic engineer and we see aircraft flying from san francisco to lax continually in the evening coming from the north and moving to the se so i said it must have been a plane.  they said no it was a ufo.   i sat down and we started to talk. about 5 minutes later i saw a flash in the  sky which was due west of us about 10-20 miles which would put it over oxnard or perhaps over the pacific ocean.  the flash lasted 1-2 seconds it was bigger and about 10 times brighter than a strobe on a commercial airliner and 10 times brighter than a plane with their landing lights on.  the size of the flash was about the size of my thumb nail. i yelled out i just saw a flash.  about 5 seconds later it flashed again and my sons girl friend saw it and said that's what we saw.  then about 5 seconds later it flashed again and all three of us saw it.  we watched intensely to see if it was going to flash again. it flashed a 3 and 4 time moving a few inches in the sky between each flash. it was about 20-30 degrees off the horizon. i estimate the object to be between 3,000- 5,000 feet above the ground.\r\n\r\non the 4 the flash, within a few milliseconds from the start of the flash a meteor streaked from orbit straight down towards the flashing object. the meteor had a trail of sparks and it intersected with the path of the strobe  light.  they both went out at the exact time they intersected.    i immediately thought something was shooting at the object from space.  it looked like at the time they intersected that they hit but there was no  explosion or flash, they both just went out as it looked like they hit. because there was no explosion i am not sure they actually hit.  we watched the sky for another 30 minutes but never saw either of the objects again.\r\n\r\nwhat is the chance of seeing a meteor at the same time as the ufo and what are the chances of them intersecting in the sky at the same time?\r\n\r\nso i am not sure if this was a alien space craft or a missile test.  the object was near pt. magoo navel base but i believe it was north of that base which is about 20 miles from here.  \r\n\r\ni would appreciate if you have any similar sightings to let me know.

the most incredible thing i ever saw in my life. there is to much to say to be able to post here in a few brief statements. every time i would go to the plaza in hamburg i would always sense something in the sky... like there was something in the sky for second and would be gone. it would be above the buildings along the plaza where we would go shopping. one day we went to eat at applebee's, and i decided to play a trick without anyone looking. my family went around a corner on the way to enter the building, and i jumped back out for a second and waved into the direction i thought i seen something, then went back around the corner. as i walked inside the building to get my seat, i was shocked by electric from head to toe. it almost felt like i stepped on a power cord. i went and sat in my seat next to the window overlooking the parking lot where i waved when i was outside. then i seen a 100 foot long perfect disc come down out of the sky graceful. it was silver looking on top like reflecting the sky. i just stared at it not really thinking about what i was really looking at. it hovered then landed in the parking lot. a white beam cascaded down from the bottom. then i started to see other vehicles come out of no where that all had different shapes, colors, and sizes flying in all different directions all at very fast speeds. i herd no sounds. it dawned on me that this was weird and what was i looking at? i thought in a second of disbelief turning my head to look if this was a reflection on the window from a tv or something. there was no tv and i snapped my head back to look again to figure out what i was seeing. then once i was going to stand up, to take a closer look, the disc took off above the ground where it landed into a hover position. then it darted off into the sky about a 100 feet up. the disc now had some dimension to it with little port lights all around the edges and spun in a counter clockwise motion. the faster the disc traveled the faster it spun. it travels at a super sonic speed in a shuffle like motion... staggered but fast. it traveled another 100 feet across the sky then stopped again... and then came back down to hover above the ground again. then it changed shape with some kind of protrusion coming out from underneath it. it was all black looking like the sharp rigged edges over lapping itself. there were little port lights between each edge. the bottom part of the object looked like it had markings and designs with a silver looking horn shape on each end. it swopped up somehow to the window, at least some portion of this thing. for a few second, there was a round port light pressed up on the window. i stair at it trying to see what was in the white crystal looking light at least 5 feet across in front of me. it was like looking into a window that was lighted up on the inside but you could not see anything. it then suddenly flew straight up and was gone. nothing more was in the parking lot in sight. this was the main disc i was watching, i felt there was more going on in the parking lot, but i did not want to take my eyes off the larger disc because i was afraid it would be gone. somehow i felt more was going on that i could not see. these were space craft, not ufo's from what i seen. it draws me to a lot of questions and thoughts. what is going on and what the hell was that? my reaction after that was, did i really see what i think i saw... seemed impossible if not out of this world. my daughter sitting next to me that never said a word picked up her soup bowel and flipped it upside down in the air... she was 12 years old... i said, \"what did you see\" she said in a very friendly voice that they were the people from space. it only verified what i seen and i did not say a word up until then. it made me feel what i seen was real and what could it have been? i did see two people walking around outside the building looking in at us after this event. i debated to go outside and look around but decided to just stay where i was for then. just one note; there are telephone lines over that parking lot that it came down between and landed. i made note of that while watching this event. a few months later the telephone poles were cut and caused a black out in hamburg, new york. they said they found the man that cut them down but he stated that he never cut them down. i think

think much of it.  he asked me if my camera had a good lens.  i was slightly puzzled but replied and said the lens is good but i can't zoom that far out, it only goes up to 55.  i asked why, he said there was a guy on his chair lift earlier who said he saw 3 unexplainable objects in the sky.  you could tell it was windy higher up because the clouds were going by at about 15-20mph.  i looked up, didn't see anything and the guy i was talking to went on skiing but kept looking up as he went. \r\n\r\n\r\ni kept looking up but didn't see anything for about 5 min until there was a break in the clouds and that's when i witnessed the first one.  basically it looked like a white orb.  if you really starred at it, it looked almost rectangular but that could of been just from looking at it too long?  i moved over a few feet and waited a little longer for a bigger break in the clouds.  after about 10 or 15 min there was a much clearer sky and you could easily see 3 objects that were all hovering perfectly still within the atmosphere between 15,000 and 20,000 feet i'd say just like the skier has said.  i pointed it out to almost everyone within earshot distance to me.  everyone tripped out with wonder, excitement and a little uneasiness all at the same time.    \r\n\r\n\r\nit was definitely not something you see everyday in the sky and everyone knew it.   by the time i left my station on the mountain it was 3:30-3:45pm and i saw that the middle object had move further south.\r\n\r\n\r\nby process of  elimination balloons were out because the wind was clearly blowing fast so balloons would have moved all over the place if they were tethered down.  aircraft, like helicopters were out because you would of been able to hear 1 let alone 3 if they were hovering, these weren't making any sound.  even small drones were out because they eventually have to refuel.  if it was military why would they remain stationary in an area that could be hit by passing aircraft?
