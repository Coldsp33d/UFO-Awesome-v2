lights moving across the sky over the ocean (long beach, ca)north east.  were soon joined by more. the lights appeared to be moving only a bit faster than helicopter speed, but hard to say because i had no idea how big or how far away they might be.. but appeared within maybe a 1/2 mile and flying relatively low altitude. three of the lights went into a triangle formation, then another set of 3 did the same. just before they seemingly dissolved, and disappeared, they seemed to become a small white dot and i could almost make out a craft form before they shot off at amazing speed. they did this at different points in time, and seemed to go different directions. as i watched and headed downstairs (2nd floor balcony walkway) i continued to watch. a man approached me almost immediately ranting about the ufo's i'd been observing. as i rode off on my bike, one of the orange sperical lights remained.. and i continued to watch it for another five minutes or so. this is the first time i've ever seen something like this, (52 years old), and i thought sure there would be hundreds of reports on it, but i have not seen one anywhere after looking extensively. very strange.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

cloudy. near intersection of county line rd. i observed a large, distant bright white aerial object about 20 degrees above rooftops. it hovered and then made a large arcing path movement, then hovered. it appeared to be constantly shape shifting. my first thought was a pelican, which nest in the landfills near highway i-25. but the way it hovered in one place and seemed to be constantly changing shape made this unlikely. also at the observed distance it would have to be a pelican the size of a prop plane. \r\n\r\ni watched this object remain stationary yet changing shape for a good 4-5 minutes as i traveled north. i then observed two fighter jets in tight formation come in from the right (east) flying relatively low (enough to see details of underside).  they flew overhead and made a sharp curve northeast which put them in the direction of the white object, though they were still some distance from it.  as they kept on course, now by perspective \"close\" to the object (far in distance but side by side in vision) the white object disintegrated. in about ten seconds the object just faded into nothing. it did not move, or sink. it literally looked like a movie special effect where it just dissolved into nothing.\r\n\r\nthe fighter jets broke their formation after the object disappeared and went east and west, respectively. the area i live in, east aurora co is home to buckley afb. fighter jets, huge air carriers and military helicopters flying low are a daily occurrence.   they are so loud that they shake the house, and i have observed many different interesting aircraft flying around here, but nothing like what i saw that thursday.  i also have never seen the fighter jets fly in that tight side by side formation, one slightly in front of the other. i have seen the four unit formation and single jets, as well as a few flying a good distance apart but nothing like the flight behavior i saw that day.

as out.  now inside the circle inside the center is where the fire was. the fire looked just like the fire from a rocket as it ascends from launch. only thing was the fire was trailing behind. it was a short bright white and orange contained blasting fire. it didn't make a sound at all. i craned my head as it passed to try to see what was above the flames, but it was so dark i couldn't make it out. i saw some vague outline of the rest of the object above the flame. i didn't see a full outline, just a quick snip of some dark mass. it almost looked like it was the size as one of  those

at the main entrance of \"las americas mall\" 7795 west flagler street, in miami, florida. \r\nwhen coming back home and driving through fontainebleau boulevard, two blocks west of park boulevard, at 6:50 pm, my wife shouted from the van front passenger seat, very loud: \"what is that!!!  a flying saucer??? i immediately looked and saw a large object, 100 to 200 ft in size, completely stationary at about 1,500 ft. in altitude, hovering right in the path of several planes that were landing at that very moment all coming to the airport from the west.\r\nwe are absolutely sure that the pilots were looking at the object, as it was right in front of them. airplanes were landing at least on two of the three runways the miami international airport has for planes coming from the west.\r\nthe object was illuminated very bright in yellow or gold light and changing to green light with regularity. it had approximately the shape of a blimp.\r\nafter some minutes the object went dark, the lights went off.\r\nthen the lights came back and the object suddenly accelerated directly up, at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from our sight.\r\nthere was no cloud cover. we had total visibility.\r\nat first i thought the object may have been a blimp, but i have never seen a blimp that illuminates their whole surface in such a bright light and also changing colors or going totally dark, precisely sitting at a place where planes are landing.\r\non the other hand, it will be absurd for a blimp to sit stationary right on the path of several landing planes. the miami international airport has three landing runways for planes coming from the west. the object was over the one in the middle. also, blimps cannot accelerate suddenly the way this object did. and certainly not go up and go away in a second.\r\nat that very moment, there was a huge plane landing on the main runway, the runway placed at the south of the airport. before going up and away, the object was to the right of that airplane from our point of view. the pilot must have seen the object to his left, like half a mile away from him, at about 6:55 pm on december 17, 2014.","distance":"Over One

sky as i am an avid star gazer. there was minimal cloud cover to the south and the sky was dark enough to observe stars in the background. at approximately 60 degrees above the horizon to the east i noticed 5 lights blinking in succession starting with the one furthest to my south and extending approximately 90 degrees evenly across my field of view to the north. my initial thought was that it might be a satellite, but surprisingly there was also a satellite streaking across the sky from the north-east heading south-west. this provided me with a reference for atmospheric conditions and distance. the satellite maintained light characteristics and moved at a constant speed behind the blinking lights. thus the blinking lights had to be within the distance from earth to the satellite.  \r\n\r\nat this point i felt very excited by what i was witnessing and called into the house for my girlfriend to come and observe. she came within 10 seconds and also observed the same phenomena. \r\n\r\nseconds later i noticed a military plane coming from the north with solid red and green lights. the jet followed in the direction of the blinking lights, and when it past my view directly east i could hear the jet engine. at this time the 5 lights were still traversing in a south-east direction but started to turn more east, also the pattern in which the blink changed to be more random than sequential. each blink lasted a fraction of a second, with time in between blinks ranging from 1 to 3 seconds. when first observed the lights were arranged linearly, but as i witnessed them moving more east the line of lights changed to more of a random configuration, this led me to think the 5 lights were in fact separate objects rather than one. \r\n\r\ni eventually lost sight of the objects behind the southern cloud cover, though i could still hear the jet engine from the plane for an additional 1 to 2 minutes. \r\n\r\nafter the sighting i felt very energized and ecstatic. it was a good feeling and not one of anxiety or nerves. i kept thinking to myself \"no way i have never seen anything like this before\". \r\n\r\nmy background in observation is two-fold. first i was a trained seamen in the us navy from 2004-2008 where i achieved the rank of e-5. my job was a quartermaster, making weather observations and identifying aircraft on lookout. secondly, in college i took multiple astronomy classes in which we made astronomical observations and have witnessed on many occasions satellites. this sighting is something i have never witnessed

right by the schuykill river. i've never seen lights so sparkling and crystal reflective like. the ufo was round with about 30 of sparkling lights around the edge of the ufo. i only was able to view it for about 5 seconds because i was driving. i asked my mom who was with me, \"did you see that?\" at first i thought i was seeing things but she affirmed she had also seen it too and she seemed in

in the sky movement that attracted my attention to sky ahead and to the left of me. ahead maybe mile or more. to my left looked like 200 yard north of the expressway i was driving. try to focus and make sense of what i was seeing could have been a box kite, viewing an airplane from behind. the object seemed to be moving away from me and traffic but not at a fast rate more like if traffic was not thick i could have caught up and past it in a minute of seeing. \r\n\r\nwhen i could not clearly make out what it was , imagine a smaller airplane headed away from you like a dark shape. then say the plane would start climbing, now i can or should see the top surface. that is when it became like reflective foil changing size and shape. this made realize i can not make this thing out! traffic is slow so i go back and forth traffic and sky. \r\no observed this shape changing white silver -blue reflective like site. seems like surrounding the reflective i can remember like dark gray 'overspray'

autumn 1971 should be close. i was on watch at the time and was manning our spa-4 radar. i reported to the bridge that i had a contact coming toward us out of the ne at the unbelievable speed of 750 knots. a couple of minutes later the bridge responded that they had a visual on blinking red lights. watching the scope i calculated that the contact came to an abrupt stop at a range of 2000 yds. the bridge responded with confirmation that the craft was hovering. it was observed by myself on radar and by the bridge visually, to hover about 5 minutes. then just as suddenly as it appeared, i tracked it move to the east at 750 knots. as i recall, i was sweeping at a range of less than 50 miles. the spa-4 was a surface radar that would not detect at a very high altitude. the visual horizon from the bridge was about 15 miles. when i first saw the craft on radar it was approximately 30 miles away. hope this can be of some help even though it was a long time ago.","distance":"Over One

ran back down the trail leaving me all alone.   i then have a memory of a few humanoid looking greyish beings come up to me.  my next memory was being on the edge of the woods with the creatures looking out into a parking lot next to the horse barn.  they were saying i had to return to my family but i recall not wanting to go but wanting to stay with them.   hesitantly i walked out of the

might be a blimp. the lights were not that high or that far from me and i am certain it was not a blimp. there was no structure i could see, only lights. i then thought it might be balloons or the
