States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This was august, summer of 1977.  it was about 9 o’clock at night.  it was not totally dark.  where we lived on long island was close to the flight path of jfk, so we were used to seeing planes fly high overhead our house.  we lived in a somewhat rural area, on 2 acres of land, surrounded by trees, with neighbors on either side.  it was after dinner, and i went outside with my older brother, who was 20 and going to college at dartmouth, his girlfriend, my younger sister who was 16, and our cousin, who was 14 or 15.  it was a beautiful night and my sister tina was the first to notice 3 odd lights in the sky beyond our back fence.  these lights were in a triangle formation, they were low in the sky, and brighter than the stars in the sky.  and they seemed to be coming right towards us.  we didn't think they were planes, since they were so low, so at first we thought they might be helicopters.  they were moving side to side in unison, and we couldn’t hear any noise.  at this point we just stood there and watched these lights, trying to figure out what they were.  then, somehow, two of the lights just blinked out, but one of them kept approaching us, moving slow and steady.  as it got closer, the light was getting brighter and bigger and it started to appear like an object.  this is when we first thought that we might be seeing a flying saucer.  because it didn’t have any wings, it was completely silent, and it was moving very slowly and deliberately.  soon, we all became convinced that we were being approached by a classic saucer shaped ufo.  we were scared and mesmerized at the same time.  at this point, my brother told us that he wanted to run to the house to get his glasses so he could see it better.  and he ran back to the house and left the four of us there in the backyard.  in the minute and a half that he was gone, this craft came right over our neighbor’s yard, slowly and silently, and then stopped right next to us at tree top level over our neighbor’s back yard.  the disc was about 60 feet in diameter, probably about 100 feet over the ground, and approximately 150 feet away from us.  it was a classic silver saucer shape.  the surface looked metallic silver, almost like brushed metal, and it had a dome on the bottom, and it had a light right in the center of this dome, i think it might have been blue.  there were red, green and blue lights moving around the perimeter of the saucer in a pattern.  i didn’t see any windows or openings.  and i couldn’t see the top of the ufo because it was almost directly above us.  it sat there above us completely still, silent and not moving.  at this point, we were all scared and paralyzed with fear.  we were all holding each other as tightly as we could, and i remember trying not to breathe or make noise, because i was afraid that the ufo might notice us and focus its attention on us.  i didn’t know what might happen, but i was definitely afraid of being taken away.  then all of a sudden, out of the bottom center of the ufo, a bright white cone of light appeared and hit our neighbor’s yard.  it was so bright that i couldn’t see anything past the light, and the grass it was illuminating appeared to be white.  now i was physically shaking and afraid that the light was going to sweep towards us, but i had no idea what might happen.  then all of a sudden, the white light beneath the ufo went out and in almost an instant, the ufo banked and zipped over our neighbor’s roof until it was a pinpoint in the sky, literally in just a split second.  as it left, it was the only time the ufo made any noise, as a heard a very faint, high pitched whirring noise, similar to the noise that an old fashioned top made when you pulled the string hard to get it spinning.\r\n\r\nafter the ufo left, we all ran screaming towards the house, and met up with my brother who was running back outside.  he asked us where the ufo was, and we were jumping up and down and talking all at once, describing what we had just witnessed.\r\n\r\nwe then ran inside the house to tell my parents and some friends they had over.  but when we told them we saw a ufo, they all laughed at us and dismissed it as if we had just told them funny joke.  at that moment, something inside me hardened, and i think i instantly realized that no one would ever believe what i had just seen.  what’s even stranger, is that after that night i never discussed the ufo with my brother, sister or cousin for about 30 years.  and i didn’t tell anyone about it until i told a girlfriend 4 years later. \r\n\r\nfor the next 30 years i only told 5 or 6 of my closest friends about the encounter.  but i made sure that they knew me very well, and i usually prefaced my story by saying, “promise me you won’t judge me and differently after i tell you this story.”\r\n\r\nabout 7 years ago, i got up the nerve to ask my sister if she remembered seeing the ufo.  i was relieved when said yes, and i asked her to describe it to me.  she remembered the same details that i did.  next i called my brother to ask him what he remembered, but he reminded me that he missed the close encounter because he was in the house getting his glasses.  i then called my cousin, but he just remembered that something incredible had happened, but he didn’t remember seeing the ufo, although he did remember something that had to do with a bright light.  last, i asked my brother to locate his old girlfriend and find her.  he hadn’t spoken to her in over 30 years, but he did email her, and she responded that she also remembered something strange happened that night, but she didn’t remember seeing the ufo either, but distinctly remembered seeing a bright white light that night.\r\n\r\ni was a little disappointed that only my sister and i vividly remembered all the details of that evening, but my cousin’s and my brother's girlfriend's recollections convinced me that we had all witnessed something unusual that night.  and since then, i have heard that it’s not unusual for some ufo witnesses to not be able to recall all the details of their encounter.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

then saw what i initially thought was a hawk coasting towards our house. i say hawk because it was high enough to be a bird of prey, but low enough to be below any fly zone of aircraft.  it looked brown/copper with a triangular wing shape at first, which i thought were the street lights reflecting off of brown hawk wings.  it looked like it was about 150-200 ft in the air. hard to tell exactly.  it was completely silent.  i pointed it out to my daughter and we both watched it cruise over our house directly overhead.  as it got closer i saw that the triangular brown tint of the wings was actually very dull copper colored lights in symmetrical fashion and equidistant from each other. also, in addition to the triangular pattern of dull lights, there was an additional single light extending off to the right of it (about 2 to 3 times the width of the base of the triangle away from it).  i got the impression that there was a triangle flying with a single arm branching off of it with a single light. it came at a constant speed and the \"arm\" was in constant distance/speed as the body of the craft as if it were connected.  it passed directly over us at a constant and silent speed (at about the speed of a coasting hawk) and we watched it pass over our house and continue on into the distance.  it did not ever increase elevation, but stayed at a consistent altitude.  it was definitely consisting of very dull copper lights in the shape of a triangle.  my 5 yr old daughter and i both watched it and were in awe.  we didn't speak much of it as we went inside.  but a week later she was drawing a picture with crayons and when i asked her what it was, she told me it was the space ship we saw that night.  to my shock, she had drawn exactly what i thought i saw.  a triangle with lights and a long arm sticking out to my right with a single light.  i took a picture of her drawing for future reference.  since then, i have gone outside to look at the sky and have seen nothing.  the picture she drew is in my phone, which i don't know how to upload to this page.  but if someone really wants to know and has reason to pursue it, i guess i don't mind going to some effort and emailing you the drawing.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

- fire planes/helicopters - private jets - classic military/historic aircraft & occasional military jets which make a lot more noise, so we are familiar with the sound of normal air traffic.On the evening of 12/13/2014 the uniquely loud and reverberating sound of rotor blades was heard within our house. over several hours & after multiple occasions hearing the approaching aircraft rotor sound increase and then decrease as it flew over and past the house i looked out side but could see nothing. the fourth and final time i heard the sound of the helicopter / aircraft approaching i went outside immediately to see what aircraft was making all the noise. i exited my home which faces west, looking towards the approaching sound i observed a large helicopter with it's lights blinking on my left moving from south to the north west, within a few seconds the glowing object appeared from the tall trees that line the street on both sides emerged into the open sky to our nw. the helicopter was right behind it. the helicopter had the standard yellow/white running lights & a red blinking light the object it was following/pursuing did not. the object was 100-150 yards ahead of the helicopter. both moved very fast to the nw and as it did the orb/glowing object became less visible & seemed to fade out of sight or was obscured by trees ect. i did not wait to see if it would reappear i wanted to tell my wife what i just saw. the helicopter was about the length of a smashed flat 6 inch subway sandwich at arms length in the sky to give you an idea of scale and distance. the glowing object/orb perhaps the size of a penny-nickle.Im making this statement because as a rational religious and moral person this event struck me as very odd & unique - after digging through many google searches with multiple terminology i was able to find almost identical accounts from others within this last year on the website ufogrid ","distance":"101-500

75 feet at it's largest diameter. \u000bas we were crossing the bridge i was looking up through one of the openings in the clouds. through the hole i saw part of an object. it appeared to be on the other side of the cloud. at first i thought it might be the front or rear of a deridgable. it was grey in color, dull and smooth. i called attention to the other dude in the back and he looked at it and just stared back at me in bewilderment. \u000bi started shouting to the driver to stop the car and pull over. as soon as we got onto the on-ramp for the next freeway we were able to pull over. we all got out of the car and stared at it. by now the clouds had exposed it a little bit more, but nothing could be made out any more than a dull oblong shape. then, the object appeared to be struck by the sun and it glistened like we were looking at the end and bottom of a very shiny, metallic object. there were no seams, windows, wings or anything. a few minutes later the clouds covered it completely.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":61982,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.129547,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12142014-0008","longitude":-72.578492,"occurred":52556400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1418617211000,"summary":"Large dull then shiny object above clouds","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/61982_submitter_file1__MassachusettsUFOSighting1.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"01108","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":15810,"locationName":"Springfield, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:75984"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"San Antonio","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I stepped outside at 0650 hrs to smoke a cigarette, it was still dark outside.  while i was sitting on a small covered front porch i noticed a bright light infront of me to the right. i leaned to my left around the brick pillar to see what was making the light and i saw there was a white glowing huge square shaped object directly across the street.  it looked like it was as bigger then a two story house.  it was stationary over the house across the street.  i quickly switched on my cellular phone camera, i braced my phone up against the right side of the pillar and took two pictures. i switched the camera to video and braced the phone up against the pillar again and proceeded to record for 2 minutes.  i had to stop recording at that point due to needing to leave home to pick up a customer at 0710-0715.  the object/lights was still above the house across the street when i stopped filming. i did not have the opportunity to continue observing it.  \r\n\r\ni have the video available but cannot attach to this reporting.  there is a malfunction with my phone when i try to attach the file.   the two still pictures i attached were both taken at 0653, if you increase the font/size you can see the object best.  i would be happy to forward the video in another email.  \r\n\r\nmy husband and i have been going to the san antonio mufon meetings for the last three years.  i look forward to hearing from you.
