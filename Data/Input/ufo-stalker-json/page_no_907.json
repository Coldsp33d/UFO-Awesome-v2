was relatively clear. the arc of it's trail was immediately noticeable as a massive bow wave type arc of light that originated from a dot of blue/white light high in the sky (maybe about 30k-50k feet up). it traveled in an east by southeast direction. i watched for about a minute before i ran inside for a camera. took me less than 30 seconds to get my camera but by the time i reached the front door (it was closer than the side door where my father was) my father yelled that the light was gone. he told me that it had shut off before coming back on for a few seconds, then it sort of broke up or exploded and was gone.\r\ni know what rocket contrails and meteor arcs look like and this object was flying very straight and the bow wave/trail was too big and too wide to be from a meteor or anything man made. rockets don't leave that kind of bright arc. nor do they have that kind of blue/white color.\r\nmy house faces directly south so i knew that it was traveling east, from right to left across my line of sight. excited since it was first ufo i've ever seen first hand and i wish i'd been able to get a picture or two of it as keepsakes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

walking to the corner store. on our way home, while crossing the intersection at pacheco blvd. we noticed a very bright light in the sky to our left. so big and bright and hovering very low in the sky. we could not have mistaken it for anything. it was too close. i immediately tried to take photos with my cellphone and thought they weren't taking when i observed the first craft/object release a second object directly below itself. the second craft/ object was identical to the first except in size. the second was somewhat smaller. both craft/objects hovered for a few minutes. the brightness was more than a bright light, it appeared almost faceted, a vivid beautiful reflective light. not painful to the eye. also not easy to ignore.The light was so bright that we could not determine edges, a shape or occupancy. after a few minutes the second,smaller craft/object vanished. gone. now, for another minute or two we were even more closely watching the first craft/object, and just like the other, it too was suddenly gone. the crafts seemed round or sphere like, they were completely silent. there were no smells or noticeable trails following them. they appeared very low in the night sky, and large. from our view they seemed at least basketball sized.\r\nsince this sighting i have felt different about the night sky. i initially thought that my cellphone didn't take the photos. about a week later i checked my images and was pleasantly surprised at what i had captured.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1
