part-time as a poker dealer in a club located right on pacific coast hwy 1 in oceano, ca. through this stretch the hwy is only two lanes. the club was located on the east side of the highway and on the opposite site was a field, railroad tracks, and an area close to the road that some of the patrons would park in. the particular night in question there was a scheduled missile launch of some sort at vandenberg air force base at 10:00 pm. since the sky was clear the players at my table thought it would be fun to go across the street and watch the launch so we paused the game and all went out to watch about 5 minutes prior. as scheduled the launch went off flawlessly and we returned and continued the game. the game went on for another 4-5 hours and then broke so my shift was over. \r\n\r\n20 minutes later i'm driving up my driveway which is out in the woods located on carpenter canyon rd (hwy 227). the property slopes up a decent hill (maybe 400 ft elevation change from the road to the top of the hill/ridge). the driveway is surrounded with pretty high trees so you have the feeling of being in a tunnel. after 100 feet up the driveway there is a left turn which immediately opens up to a sloping field. the trailer i'm staying in is on the left about 30 feet away and the field runs up the hill about another 75 feet. at that point the hillside is covered with trees to the top and over. \r\n\r\nas i pull in front of our mobile home, my attention is immediately caught by a bright white light emanating out of the bottom center of a purplish glowing object hovering 20 feet above the treetops on the ridge (trees may have been 30 ft tall). the purplish object was approximately 30 -40 feet wide and 7 - 12 feet thick. the white light was about 3 feet wide and went straight down through the trees like a light tube. the object sat there for a maybe 10 seconds or so while i parked and got out of my car. then i stood there for 20 - 30 seconds staring at it when i decided to wake up my girlfriend. she came out immediately and we both watched it for several minutes longer. then it just vanished-like turning off a light. however, there was a black smoke/soot left in the sky where the purplish shape was.  \r\nthought it was odd that i could never really made out an object, just the purplish glowing mass.\r\n\r\ni've included a photo and added/edited the object and light beam. the photo is not of the actual location either as i've not lived in the area for some time. the second photo shows, poorly, the soot.","distance":"101-500

orange spheres in a triangular formation. i was traveling southbound down gilbert rd approaching the stop light at queen creek rd and the objects were to the southwest of my location.  they were solid orange and very bright.  i continued southbound on gilbert rd to ocotillo rd and they remained stationary or moved very slowly.  at 8:35 i arrived at my home near the intersection of gilbert rd and ocotillo. the neighbors across the street from my house were putting up their outdoor christmas decorations.  i pointed the lights out and they saw them too. the objects had moved southwest from the original sighting but were still clearly visible and unusually bright.  we watched them for a few minutes and i began getting things from my car. the neighbors said “the lights are gone” and a few minutes later they said “there they are again”.  i stepped out of the garage to look and snapped a photo with my phone. this time there were two of them horizontal to the ground instead of three in a triangle pattern and they stayed lit for three or four minutes until they disappeared.  i went inside and told my father in law about the sighting.  a few minutes later after getting my son ready for bed i looked out the 2nd story window. i saw that the three orange balls of light had reappeared in a straight line parallel to the ground but were further west than before.  i ran downstairs to get my father in law so he could see them and we went into our backyard for observation.  they lasted for about 10 minutes before finally disappearing.  i finished getting my son ready for bed and sat on the couch to continue looking out the window.\r\naround 8:55 the lights reappeared and i went to get binoculars.  the binoculars didn’t help due to low magnification capability and a few minutes later all of the lights faded out.  i went back upstairs and kept an eye on the area through the window.  then at approximately 9:00 pm two lights appeared further away than before, so i went to the upstairs balcony for a different perspective.  i took a few more pictures with my phone.  this time they lasted for ten or fifteen minutes before disappearing.  at 9:25 a single light appeared in the same area so i went back out to the balcony.  the light had moved closer to my position from the last appearance but i still could not tell what it was.  while i was observing this light, two more lights which were evenly spaced appeared to the far right of the original light,  a few seconds later two more evenly spaced lights appeared to the left, and finally two more lights which were also evenly spaced appeared to the left the other four. there was a total of seven lights in a straight line. there were three sets of two lights evenly spaced from each other with the original light further to the left. they were above the height of the street lights from my point of view and above the tree line in the distance.  they lasted for a few minutes before they disappeared but i managed to take some more photos with my phone.  they all disappeared at 9:31 and i went inside. at 9:35 a helicopter flew slowly through the area. i continued to look out the window for a couple more hours but they never reappeared.\r\nthe objects appeared to be near the gila river indian community and south of the chandler municipal airport.  being a former air force security police k-9 handler and living near the municipal airport i know what planes and helicopters look like.   these objects made no sound, they did not have navigation lights, they were not chinese lanterns, or any kind of drones that i am aware of.  after doing a bit of online research i found that lights like these have been seen in this area more than once this year and sometimes they occur multiple nights in a row usually between 8:00 and 10:00. i called the chandler municipal airport and the chandler police dispatcher but they had no reports of unusual activity. i will keep an eye on the sky and maybe i will get a better glimpse of the objects next time.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

made them unobservable. i don't believe they were birds. there was no flapping of wings or any features that made me think they were a flock of birds. however a few blocks away my sister said she

without obstruction in the eastern sky about 30 degrees above was a 'blinky' light we call them -- we often see these kinds of ufo lights.  this time, however, i had a binocular and focused in on it.  it was a 3d spherical object that had spoke like legs to a ring with a hub facing (forward?).  the hub blinked very brightly alternating red, blue, white.  inside the 3d sphere were seemingly random firecracker like lights going off, red and white.  the object, from our vantage point, hovered and notably gyrated up and down and to the right and left.  the longer we watched the slowly more faint and possibly farther away the ufo was.  the body of the ufo changed orientation often, at least every few minutes, the hub facing east, then northeast, then north and then northwest.  we had to often refocus the binoculars to get clarity.  we felt a photo would be worthless just showing a tiny bright dot in the sky.\r\n\r\nacross our valley to the southwest over the sheep mountains was another one

night football where, to my left, is a large picture window that has a perfect view into the eastern sky - \r\n\r\nweather conditions:  cool winter night...Wide open sky with blood moon...Beautiful night with a very starry sky - especially clear - \r\n\r\nat just over 10pm, something fell into view (from the top of the window down) out in the sky - i mentioned it to my wife and we both looked at it for approx 5 seconds until we realized it was moving - it was uncommon enough to make me get up from the football game and go out on the back deck - i did get an adrenaline surge when i realized that it was/is (its still out there by the way....) either a weather ballon strapped to the teeth with mxas lights....Or something alien to any aircraft im aware of\r\n\r\nerratic flight path but mostly hovering...Seems to be approximately 5 miles away?.....Hard to guess - something tells me it is directly over mineral springs, nc - downtown - \r\n\r\nseems to be a combination of small orbs at times...Green and blue...Some red...Then gets hyper white - looked at it with a monocular (simmons) and it hard to explain what im seeing...Either the \"trace\" of the light in the lense (ie optical illusion) or it is indeed 3 orbs that make up 1 craft...Ostensibly anyway.\r\n\r\ni took pictures and video which will be terrible im sure...The pictures are interesting but leave alot to speculation - i did notice that when i zoomed in on it (iphone 5s) that it appeared to \"pulse\" at the me through the frame (the object did) - i factored this into some type of camera/lens related issue....But this thing is up there and you wouldnt notice it unless you were on your back looking up at the stars...So im certain someone else will report!  very cool - ","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
