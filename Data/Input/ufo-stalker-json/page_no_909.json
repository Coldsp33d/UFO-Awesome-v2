below.\r\n\r\nin april of 1981, my fiancee and i had accompanied her parents to visit her brother and family in scottsboro, alabama. i drove the entire distance in her father's car, (at that time) a late model olds cutlass coupe. we had been visiting and talking into the night and i had a beer or two. it began to get late and my fiancee (now wife, anna, of over 33 years) and i were to go stay with her brother's in-laws in town. her brother lived in a log home on a peninsula into the back waters and main channel of the tenn. river, at roseberry creek. it was populated, with some street lights, but not many. the evening was clear with few clouds and a partial full moon. (it should also be noted that just up the tenn. river, in stevenson, was, at that time, a nuclear reactor project which was in the process of being built in hollywood, just to the north of the location of this incident, the bellefont reactor project. i am not sure if there was any nuclear material at the sight at that time, as the unit is still unfinished. another site just north of the bellefont unit, at widow's creek, is coal fired and likely being shutdown.)\r\nat around 11:30pm, we left her brother's house and began the 5-7 mile trip to the in-laws house. after about 1/4 mile, the car began to knock and shut off. the radio stopped and shut off. at the same time, a bright white light appeared over the tree line just off the road to the right (approx. to the ne). we had the windows cracked about 2 inches and noticed no crickets which we heard upon leaving the house and entering the car. the road is narrow at that point, with water on the left side and a house just prior to it. there is a street light at that point, which had also turned off when the bright light appeared.\r\n\r\nas the intense and blinding white light shone upon us through the windshield with us trying to peer up and find out what was going on, anna asked if we should get out to see. i said \"no.\", also mentioning that we should stay buckled in and lock the doors, forgetting about the windows being partially down. i looked at my new seiko lcd watch and it had stopped, as the screen was blank and even the internal light would not work when i pressed the button. anna's battery powered analog watch even stopped. i don't remember the exact time, though.\r\n\r\nafter what seemed to be an eternity, the bright white light simply disappeared. no noise of any kind was heard until the radio came back on and the crickets began to chirp again. we looked at each other in shock at what had just occurred. i remember her watch having restarted, but was about 10 mins. ahead and thought that was very weird since the second hand had stopped when i looked at it while the light was present.\r\n\r\ni started the car after putting it in park. apparently, i must have let the engine help slow us to a stop after the vacuum from the power brake booster was spent from my heavy braking. we continued on our journey to the in-laws and agreed to not speak a word of our experience as we thought people would think us crazy.\r\n\r\nmany years later, in 2007, while in chicago visiting her youngest niece from alabama (who is now an er doctor), we mentioned the above story to her from 26 years prior. she was not amazed as her grandparents whom we stayed with on that visit in 1981, had also experienced the exact same situation in the same location numerous times. they are both now deceased and cannot corroborate or tell their stories.\r\n\r\nwhile i believed in ufos before 1981 (a now deceased uncle worked with the usaf's ftd group at wpafb here in dayton and was elusively frank with me when describing project blue book, using a non-denial denial phrase to let me know about this subject), i had never thought much about it for about 12 years. i don't believe i was influenced by any unconscious belief in ufos with this experience in april of 1981. however, since that time, both my wife and i are avid believers and do not push aside many stories of similar or more involved sightings. sure, the govt. could be working on secret projects and the like, but that only begs the question: where did they get the technology so quickly?","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:09:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":61905,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.6723069,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12102014-0003","longitude":-86.03414629999999,"occurred":355737600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1418232583000,"summary":"Intense white light and power failure of car, street light, and watches","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":12297,"locationName":"Scottsboro, Alabama","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:76871"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Loveland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I had just turned north off of foxtail dr. onto rocky mountain ave. in loveland's centerra shopping area, when i saw a bright orange dot, initially solid in color, appear from the top of my jeep's windshield and begin heading north.  at first i thought it was a plane landing at fort-collins/loveland airport but i quickly realized it was moving far too fast to be landing. my next assumption was that it was meteor falling from the sky;

halo that's been around the moon the last few nights and while watching we saw a single dim green light fly over the entire horizon from w-nw to e in less than 4 seconds it covered the distance of the entire horizon,  because of this strange sighting we decided to spend time star watching again last tonight, (12/08/2014 approx. 10pm pst), i was standing looking straight up at the area between perseus, triangulum, andromeda & casiopa roughly at 10pm and i saw 3 very dim bluesh green lights appear where there were no stars before, the relative size would be about 3 fingers with thumb and pinky finger tucked in held out at arms length from the left light to the right light (there was a left, right and middle point of blueish greenish light), as soon as it appeared the three points of light moved together in perfect unison as if they were all attached to an invisible transparent craft or held together in some way... it moved extremely strangely if you imagine it as three points of light attached to a transparent craft it moved like an icecube melting on a hot plate slowly at first in a north west direction then did a fast sweeping turn upward toward the west (left turn) as it was turning, the left and right point of light came closer to the center point of light as if the invisible craft shrunk or folded in on itself(almost as if it was getting smaller to avoid g forces), it made a full left turn as it grew smaller then when done turning it re-expanded to the previous size and slowed to previous speed and the three lights began to grow dim and then it just dissapeared. i feel like i could see a faint triangular distortion when it moved quickly as if the craft was invisible but distorted the stars/sky around it when accelerating, if you imagine it as a triangle with a leading edge point the three lights would be on the back left, back right, and back middle, there was no light on the leading edge point, just three dim blueish green lights in a straight row moving as one and changing size. the whole sighting lasted about 6-8 seconds and it appeared to be literally in space, this did not appear close like it was in our atmosphere, to me it appeared that it was one invisible craft holding the three points of light together it would have been far away in space and at least twice the width/size of our moon, it was just incredible in size for how far away it appeared to be. it's possible that it was three seperate points of blue light intelligently moving as one but it truly did appear like three points of light held together by an invisible trangular shaped craft where you could see the distortion of the rest of the body when it picked up speed. as i began to see it i yelled to my father wo was 5 feet away inside our studio doorway: \"look look look look look look  look look there\" pointed \"look do you see it? look *points again*\" he ran out of our studio and look up where i was pointing and his jaw dropped... afterwards we discussed it and it was as if he saw the very last second of its flight where it made a full left sweeping turn and slowed and blinked out, he describes it as a streak of blueish dim light swirling across and disappearing, it was like he did not see enough of it to process the shape or arrangement but did see enough of it to know that he/we definitely saw something other-wordly -- he is certain of that. sadly my girlfriend went to the restroom just before it appeared and missed it or i would have three witnesses to this sighting.. me and the girlfriend did drive up to spyglass hill later on around 12-3am and she saw something completely different but just as other-wordly that i did not see and can't even begin to describe -- just as other worldly as my sighting earlier was, but i will leave it up to her if she feels brave enough to file a report for herself on what she witnessed. i have attached/included my best attempt at a video recreation of what i saw, it's a little choppy i am no pro with this type of stop frame video animation stuff. i'm posting this because i would really like to hear if anyone else out there just so happened to be watching the sky at the same time as me and witnessed this incredible event, if you did witness this, and or if you know anything about what i saw or what this could be, please speak up, i will be watching the comments, and the skies more often from now on. thank you.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

normally aircraft have a green light & a white light in addition to a red light. the flashing red light was way brighter than i would expect on usual air traffic. i would estimate the light to be a mile away and right above oxford city centre & was silent. i watched the light intently and whilst it flashed off there was no discernible object or outline visible despite the excellent viewing conditions. the light then went behind a clump of trees but did not re-appear - i assume it disappeared or changed course. i had observed this light for about 1min in total. after 5 mins of looking at the clump of trees (the light did not re-appear) i turned my attention back to looking at the stars. i then became aware of another bright red light (exactly the same as the first) that had suddenly appeared low in the sky to the sw in some very thin wispy low cloud. this red light flashed as before & appeared to move nw to se in a straight line, again about 30 degrees from the horizon and again there was no shape or outline seen during the off phases of the flashing. after 20secs or so this light abruptly disappeared before my eyes and a series of much smaller & dimmer red lights (5-6 lights) began to flash randomly for about 10secs where i had first spotted the flashing red light for the second time. again no outline or shape was detectable. i waited for some more action for another 10mins but nothing happened so i went inside.\r\n\r\ni observed these events very matter-of-factly & calmly as i've had a previous 'ufo' sighting 4 years ago that served to get the emotion & excitement out of my system. i'm only reporting it as there are likely to have been many others that saw what i saw - it was so low in the sky & directly above oxford city centre. i had an iphone on me but i didn't film anything as it was short duration and lights only - i know from experience that camera phones don't process night-time lights too well. also it was freezing cold and my non-smoking hand wasn't going to leave my pocket!\r\n\r\ni hope this is of some interest/help","distance":"501 Feet -

cleaning up after eating our meal, outside on side of house just outside our kitchen through a sliding glass door. i had just glanced up and saw the biggest thing i ever saw in the sky. it was huge! it was coming at me at an angle. turning and banking slowly as it turned. i was sure we have nothing on this plant that could be as big as it was, making no noise, and still maintain in the sky. only a blimp could move slowly and turn like it did, but as i mentioned, this vehicle banked as it turned. blimps don't! it could't be a decorated blimp or air ship, because it would of been to heavy and it was the size of maybe 100 plus average size blimps. it was ash black in color, with individual panels square-ish and rectangular panels like a jigsaw puzzle. you could see the outline of these panels accompanied with what looked like rivets on each and every panel. there were different colored lights not in any set order, all over the ship. the front of the ship was angled like a classic ship in the water at the bottom front of ship, going just above half way up. then it went into a aerodynamic 1/2 teardrop(on its side)like cockpit with no windows , but it matched the size of ship. i have a similar ship i found on ufo's i will explain later. the rest of the ship behind the ships forward tear drop cabin had what looked like small building of different sizes. with stacks and pipes that looked like testing equipment with lights of sorts on top and bottom of ship. the bottom not having any building or shacks just different testing equipment i will call them. the sides of the ship looked like it had 3 landing bays. there were dark shadows so you couldn't really see doors or openings. along the sides there appeared to be windows in odd places, nothing uniformed along the sides of what i would call the door jams of the bays. not to many windows maybe 15 through out ships side. they looked to be small and square in shape. the bays and jams were the only thing that looked uniformed in spaces. everything else like windows were just here and there no set pattern. the thing that got me was no noise. it was so quite, not a sound out of place other then the faint sounds of traffic on the nearby freeways and the slight sound of the breeze going through the trees nearby. when i first saw the ship my jaw fell opened the whole time i stared at this ship. i took in everything my mind would allow me to! i felt as if i was in a hypnotic state of wounder. never had quit that feeling before. even though it was like 3:00 am in the morning, i wasn't a least bit tired. and as this giant ship was turning like it was going to head towards travis air force base 13 miles away, just over the mountain top not but 3 miles away. i stopped what i was doing and went into the house and jumped in bed fully clothed and went right to sleep.Another odd thing was my girlfriend was doing something out front or inside the apartment. i should of yelled for her to come look at this ship. but it was like i couldn't speak. fortunately my girlfriend was seeing the same thing as i did out front. she experienced the same feelings. the next morning we exchanged what we both saw. this ship had no blinking lights of any kind. with the air base so close, there was no jets scambleing or anything i know of. the ship looked like it was something out of battle star gallaxia. i checked all over for air shows all over usa and hollywood. couldn't find anything to support this ship! if you look under ufo's listed as russia sept of 2012 you will find a long ship over the city video. the ship was same size but it has what looks like a turret underneath ship and no bays on its side. plus this is brown in color and the audio is really distorted and loud as it disappears through the clouds. i was so happy to find the video because it somewhat supported what i saw back in july of 1994. i just had to report this true event. it's been hanging over my head for so long as it's 20 years later as it's 2014. mufon has my full cooperation in any of these facts i have posted. i would love to tell them this story first hand. my ex girlfriend (now living on opposite coast) would do so also.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Path with directional
