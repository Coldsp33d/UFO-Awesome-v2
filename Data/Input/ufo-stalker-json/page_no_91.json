way over or even when she started down my street until she reached my driveway and looked up. it had been there for about 30 minutes and finally , after she drove off to leave.. they were gone. i tried to record it but they were visible without a flash so i took live pics from my iphone and they’re clearly visible and moving. then, two weeks later i was coming inside my house and looked up and there they were again. these were a little more visible and moved a little faster. they didn’t move in a uniform pattern like a spotlight from the ground would have and there was no beam of light from the coming from the ground. my neighbor was home so i called him over to watch them and we were both dumbfounded. i’m trying to make sense of what i’ve been seeing , i thought of the possibility of a drone but these things don’t move like lights. i am hoping that someone might explain what it is. i will attach video. although, i would rather the sound be muted if possible. i was a little freaked

beach (hilton head).  shortly after, noted orange/red orb floating across northern end of dafuskie island (haig point area) tracking due east.  object was changing altitude slightly and brightening / dimming randomly.  speed of object similar to speed of coast guard helicopters seen in the past flying in that area.  once first orb was over middle of calibogue sound two more appeared next to each other behind the first object.  all three tracked across the sound.  the first object dimmed and disappeared upon reaching the shoreline of hilton head island.  after this initial sighting five more orbs were seen one at a time in 3-5 minute intervals with same color, rough altitude, speed, and random brightening / dimming pattern.  one of these five orbs dimmed and disappeared while over the sound.  all other orbs remained lit until out of sight behind trees blocking view as they tracked over hhi heading east.  the seventh orb noted emitted light beams from the front and rear angled downward at a 45 degree angle (like half of a star burst effect of bright lights at night).  event lasted about an hour.  after last orb had exited area the large yellow light first noted moved/rotated.  at this point it became obvious that this initial yellow light was a search light from a helicopter.  said helicopter moved out of the area going due south over dafuskie island toward tybee island.  multiple commercial airplanes were noted in the area during the event going south to north on the far side of dafuskie on their normal landing pattern for savannah hilton head airport.  original thought was these lights were drones but seems unlikely due to the number and distance of travel.  orbs were following direction of prevailing winds that evening.  there is a fairly popular wedding venue at the orb's point of origin making me think chinese lanterns could be the culprit, however, orbs seemed to move much faster than prevailing winds that evening.  a call to haig point club inquiring about weddings and use of chinese lanterns that evening could solve this case","distance":"501 Feet - 1

darkness/shadow.  i felt a sense of fear come over me.  it was dire fear.  i remember looking over at my dog who was sleeping on my bed with me and feeling upset that the dog was still sleeping and not barking at the intruders or try to help me.  i then yelled at the two intruders and told them, “ hell no!  i’m not allowing it and i told them they had to leave immediately.  i couldn’t make out

a game camera to keep an eye on my gravel  driveway which is about 200 yards long.  it lays on the east side of corn field and due south is the direction the game camera is pointing.   about 1/2 mile away across a long draw and creek bed, you can see the electric transmission lines along the hilltop.   attached are 5 photos from the camera all from 28 october 2017 within 4 hours of each other. i am not sure what these objects are.  photo stc0219 looks sort of like a weather balloon, but if that's what it is - it appears to be drifting against the prevailing winds, which are normally from the nw - not the se.  i'm not even sure anyone would release a weather balloon this far from anywhere.   stc0680 and stc0681 are within the same minute.  first - there was nothing - then this dark disk.  again, it looks like an orb but it certainly wasn't around for long - a balloon would have been captured in multiple frames.  stc 0207 and stc 0247 are also disks - could they be drones?  i don't know - if you compare them to the transmission lines those poles are tall and wide - perhaps 40-50 feet apart.   if that's any reference i would suspect the round objects must be at least 30 feet in diameter, and the 'lazy triangular' object in photo stc0219 would indicate to me that is larger than 50' across and even taller.  i waited several weeks to download this game camera, and was rather surprised to see all these objects in the sky within 4 hours of each other.  we do have a commercial rotary wing aircraft that occasionally flies over.  i suspect it is 'air care' but the objects in these photos do not look like helicopters to me, and i served over 22 years in the army. submitted for your review.  i'd be interested in any ideas you may have.  contact me if you like.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\r\nwhile in the navy, onboard the uss racine lst 1191, i observed a very strange object while on watch at night.  we had left san diego on our \"westpac\" tour on october 26, 1976, according to the itinerary in my ship's cruise book.  it was two days out from when we left, so i believe the date was october 28, 1976.  our ship had departed alone without the convoy, due to mechanical repairs.  i was on the night watch on the rear of the ship, stationed to report any objects (contacts) to the bridge over the headphone set.  it was late at night, dark, and there were no lights or objects to report to the bridge.  all i could see were the stars, the horizon over the dark sea and the foam of the ships wake, no reportable contacts.  then, i heard over the headset, other crewmembers talking about something.  i looked around and saw a triangular object directly behind the ship.  it was about a half-mile away and appeared to be hovering just above the water.  it was glowing a yellowish-orange color and appeared to be very large.  everyone was chattering on the headset, and i heard someone say \"it looks like a christmas tree\".  the chattering continued until i heard someone say \"shut-up\".  i then reported a contact bearing 180 degrees, approximately one-half mile to the bridge, there was no reply.  the object continued to maintain its position for about 3 to 4 minutes.  then, i observed the object slowly getting smaller in size as if it moved directly away from us at a high speed, until it disappeared.  there was very little talk on the headphones after that and after a short while another shipmate came to relieve me.  it is a rotating 45 minute watch, so my next station was port after-steering compartment.  then i was on the port lookout on the bridge and then on the helm, (steering wheel).  while on the helm, the door behind me opened and i saw a radar technician i knew.  i asked him about what i had seen and he said there was nothing on the radar screen!  my watch finally ended without much conversation with others about what we all saw.  there had to have been at least 10 or more sailors and officers that saw what i saw.  the next day, after saluting an officer i knew, i asked him what it was that we saw last night on watch.  he then turned to me and said, \"you didn't see anything and that's the last i want to hear about it\".  there was never much talk about that incident after that and the rest of the westpac was fairly uneventful.  after all these years, i can still remember that what i saw was the most unexplainable thing i have ever witnessed.  i think i have reported this to mufon several years ago but it was a different format with less information.  in my ships cruise book, i think i can identify other crew members who may have been on watch that night.  i have told my story to my family members and others.  i know what i saw and it was very strange.  thank you.
