window showing the sky. i was going to go down the stairs to get something to eat but i hesitated at the top as i observed a bright light in the distance through said window. now i thought to myself it might be a plane because many planes fly by my house and i see their lights often if looking outside; however, i didn't immediately dismiss this light because i noticed it was brighter than normal and i hadn't yet made out the shape. a part of me always hopes to see something out of the ordinary in such a circumstance so i stood transfixed to see what the light was. it appeared as an orb of light in the distance, too bright to make anything out, yet as it moved closer the orb of light seemed to dim or become something else. i attributed this to the lights on the object becoming visible in separate spots based on distance to where as before it was further away and only appeared as one light. as this happened i noticed this was no ordinary thing. i ran downstairs as to go out the side into the backyard where i'd have a better view as it flew. to my surprise i viewed as clear as day, although it was night, a triangle flying by. i couldn't make out the surface or really the exact shape, but i made it out clearly as a triangle based on the light positioning. there was one light at the point it was facing, with 2 lights at the back base points. it had a light in the middle as well, although due to the thin nature of the triangle the point seemed closer to the back then the tip. the light in the middle was a different color than the other colors, although the exact color specifics elude after the fact. if i had to say, the middle one was probably blue with the point white and the back ones possible white or red. i observed it as a triangle so clearly and not a plane because it flew right over my house. i lost vision of it because of this. if i had to say its distance, it was so close to the roof, although when i first observed the orb in the distance it seemed very high off the ground. i saw it in the west and i lost sight of it heading east over my roof. now although this is odd i take things with a grain of salt and might've not reported this, as i've never reported a sighting before or fully believed. there was something else that prompted this, there was a second object, almost as if it was chasing it. this second object wasn't a triangle but instead a shape i can't really explain other than a sword. like the object before it i couldn't make out the exact shape but i could see how it's lights were positioned. the sword shaped ship wasn't pointy, because well, i couldn't tell, but it had a light at the time and a long space of dark before the end of what i describe as lights shaped as a sword hilt. there was one light in the back and two close to the sides like a sword hilt would be. i can't recall clearly if there was a fifth blue light in the middle like the triangle had. if there was it was be the same as in the middle actually being closer to the back than the front. i don't recall the colors of this one but if i had to say they'd be white and/or red. this object sped by much faster than then triangle had been. this is why i got the impression it was chasing it. i hadn't even noticed it as i was fixated on the triangle craft. only as the triangle passed over the roof did i look to the side to see the sword speed past in the same fashion. it's speed made the sighting very brief, i was only able to observe the sword-shaped craft for mere seconds, perhaps less than 5. for the triangle i was able to view it for a little longer, probably about 10 seconds. there was a loud sound in the air the entire time. that's what also drew my attention when i was atop the stairs. i could hear it even when it was far away. it was loud, not like a plane, but defiantly disturbing the air. i don't know how to describe it but the roar/rumble lasted the whole encounter. i stood there afterwards just looking at the sky, as if checking to see something else amazing. there was nothing there, the night sat silent as if nothing had happened at all. i ran back upstairs and opened my window, again looking out hoping to see something else. to my disappointment there was nothing more. minutes later i saw in the very far distance a plane, i could recognize it right away by it's two side light positioning. sometimes i see helicopters but those are very easy to make out and you can hear their chopper sounds. this occurrence  was very out of the norm. i'd want to say that i've seen a triangle such as this before, but i've never really believed what i saw or didn't see it long enough or clear enough to be certain. my interest gets spiked as i would've seen something, then i shake my head and fade it out. this time i got the experience, i saw it more clearly and defiantly to be able to say i don't know what it is. i want to know. if it's man-made, i want to know. whatever it is, i want the mystery revealed. i went to my computer and put the experience out of my mind. i messaged an acquaintance but he seemingly shrugged it off, perhaps not believing me. i queued into an online game and told my teammates in the lobby my story. they ignored it aside from one actively spamming \"who cares\". i tried to google some stuff to see if anything matched what i saw but with the vast amount of various other sightings i frustratingly couldn't confirm a match. i played two matches in the online game, taking over an hour collectively. i then tried to google once more and once again being stumped i conceded to just report it to mufon off a link i found while searching. so here i am reporting this long report. i don't know how you guys operate or if this will even be looked at thoroughly, but i'd like to know if other things matching these descriptions have been seen and if anyone knows what they could be.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

cutlerville, mi. a friend was just telling me inside about a ufo sighting he had. in the house we sat near each other and discussed him being in a field a ufo showed up out of nowhere and beamed a light down on him and his wife and took off. this conversation was at about 7:00pm eastern standard time, around june 2014. after our conversation inside we decided to step outside and have a smoke. we were outside and i was thinking about our conversation previously. after about 15 minutes a few other people came out of the house and all started conversating outside with one another including friend that just told me story and his wife. after about another 15 minutes, i have now detached from the conversation and now doing a little meditation by myself quietly sitting in the chair on opposite side of the other 3 people on the porch.(i am normally pretty quiet, and don't share my thoughts often). i am sort of just tranced out sitting there in my thoughts feeling where they take me(this leads to channeling quite often) and i realize i'm staring at this little electric object a friend is holding its violet in color(crown chakra in my mind), and blinks violet then holds solid green once its ready to be used. i'm following my thoughts and thinking where they are coming from and realize that this object reminds and makes me think of our conversation inside about the ufo. (i'm no stranger to \"odd\" scenarios happening in my life so wasnt anything new lol) i have alot of \"weird/odd/conspiracy/crazy whatever your would like to call it conversations with many people and have studied many odd topics that many seem to always tend to ask me/tell me about. good hidden trick of a tuned in empath :) anyways around 7:45pm-8pm i'm sitting there and feel a jerk to look up in the sky to my left (north direction) and a commercial plane flys pretty close getting close to land at gerald r. ford  airport. but out of nowhere i see this object pop out of the sky floating object just out of cloud cover not to far from the airplane. i thought i was loosing my mind so i looked away looked back and it was still there. a gray/black object like a regular ufo came in had bright white like aura around it. i reached over to my friend that was just telling me about the story earlier he seen it looked at me smiled looked back up, i looked up still there. at that point he and his wife both looked at it then continued their night like it never happened. it was kind of odd, but they both had a few drinks by then. i was sober and don't drink(22yrs old to add). i looked back up and it seemed to not move but do the same thing, at this point its been 1-2minutes and it finally just zipped straight up through cloud faster than any airplane/balloon i know of. (balloon hinting at battle of la in 1942 but wouldn't want to be a \"conspiracy theorist\" haha). i couldn't make any objects or certain lights but what i can account for is the (sob ufo) did make its presence. after that the night ensued and i was extremely connected spiritually the rest of the night with everyone around and myself. i will leave the rest of the sighting information i've typed for public view at that. i dont want to say they the other 2 friends are a witness as they were under the influence and wouldnt want them to ever have part of this kind of information being let out(some people are simply scared). ill be quite honest i'm 22 was in the marines for 3 years as a aviation mechanic and raised around a full psychopathic drug addict father. i may be \"young\" but i've been around while and i know my energy/vibration very well on this planet we are living on. i have seen many people psychologically break and even can \"see\" what many cant and dont say much. i know what i seen, and if someone would like to speak with me further about other much more pertinent \"sightings/encounter/etc\" i would be willing to speak further but not on any matrix device must be face to face with no wire taps on your skin. sorry but reality is you never know what lies behind the other persons eyes. light or darkness. we get to choose.

sat down in my chair outside in the back patio of our apartment to have a cigarette. as i was transitioning from standing to sitting i could see out of the edges of my peripheral vision what i had initially thought and assumed was a very bright planet directly in the sky about 45 degrees up in front of me (the bright white shining planet at the time was by far the brightest object in the sky–i say planet as it was unwavering and very solid as if it was a planet as i am accustomed to staring at them amidst the stars for some lengths of time at night).\r\n\r\nhowever, as i was realigning my seating position to get a bit more comfortable in my seat, i passed my head and my vision of sight briefly towards what i thought was this bright white planet in front of me. from this, i instantly got the sense and feeling that it was moving. my mind didn't really process this very well at the time, as it was stationary just seconds earlier. therefore, for a brief instant i felt as if the ground was sliding backwards underneath and away from me, disrupting my equilibrium and making me a little dizzy in the process.\r\n\r\nthis is basically what draws my attention to the fact that something is not what it seems at first. i then realize that this is not a planet, but a very bright planet-like object that is moving in a straight path across the night sky. as it moved across the evening sky, i observed that it was changing speed or velocity as it went, subtly but noticeably. though it was moving rather slowly, as an aircraft of some sort does, it seemed to move sporadically as if speeding up and slowing down as it went. it was very bright and always maintained an appearance as if it was a very bright planet-like object.\r\n\r\ni have lived here at this apartment for well over four years now, and i sit outside on the patio basically every night that my family and i have been here. i have seen all kinds and sorts of birds, planes, and helicopters flying around my area from this position and i know exactly what they all look like and have never doubted that this is all that i have ever seen whenever there were things flying around up in the sky.\r\n\r\nhowever, tonight, what i was seeing i have seen twice before in my life (in different parts of san diego, not escondido) and they were very similar and equally mysterious each time i had seen them.\r\n\r\nthis object tonight, it was large. larger than a helicopter and flying lower than most planes that i have seen flying around here with the exception of the san diego firestorm of 2014 when swathes of the nearby neighbor city of san marcos were ablaze and large aerial water tankers, helicopters, and military planes were flying real low in the area to make water and fire retardant drops on nearby areas. i am very familiar with seeing these as well and i know what they look like and this was not any of those either.\r\n\r\ni first sighted the object to be located to the south east of my position right in front of me and watched as it moved in a straight but subtly stuttering path to the north east to the left of me. it stayed on a relatively level but slightly ascending path in the process as it went. i also noticed that on three different seemingly random intervals on its path that there was a lightning-like flash of white light that emitted from the upper right of the object, reminiscent of a strobe but with a solitary single faster burst or flash that i have never seen on any kind of known craft or vehicle at night in either land, sea, or air.\r\n\r\nthere were no red or green lights or any other color of anything whatsoever as it went. it was completely silent and at some point some approximate 2 minutes or less into the incident, it rapidly dimmed, faded and altogether vanished from sight as if it was never there.\r\n\r\nthe sky at the time was clear enough that you could even see stars that had started appearing in the vicinity of where it disappeared, so there were no clouds at all that were present that it could have flown into and thus obscuring it in any way. it just dimmed and vanished.\r\n\r\nimmediately afterwards–like not even a second–i then noticed a satellite high up in the atmosphere slowly streak down in the same vicinity and direction as the object. then a second satellite very close to the first appeared almost right alongside it at a slightly different angle and then paralleled the first in direction so as to see two faint points of light coming together seemingly in unison and then straight off in the direction that the object was moving–as if immediately tracking the object and its heading.\r\n\r\na plane then appeared with bright flashing red lights immediately in the same area.\r\n\r\nafter about 5 more minutes of going inside to tell and get my wife, we both came out and seen another satellite moving towards the vicinity of where the object vanished, but this satellite was moving at what seemed to be an even greater speed than usual, a greater speed than what i've ever seen any other satellites move before, and i've seen a lot. my wife even commented on how fast it was going. once again, in all my four plus years at this location, i have never even seen one satellite cross the sky in all my times sitting out on the patio, and tonight within minutes of the unknown object i sighted there were three.\r\n\r\nthere was also a sudden intense commotion of air traffic as i sighted two more planes as well criss-cross really close together to the area of the last point of visual sighting of the object immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\nafter all of this i felt very amazed at what i saw, described it in detail to my wife, and felt that i should report it in some way to see if anyone else had seen this too. this was definitely not normal in any way, and i do not know what exactly i saw really was, but it was large, bright, moving, and then it was just gone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

even stubbornly skeptical - about strange phenomenon and other events which have no bearing on her life.\r\n\r\ntwo years ago, my mother was walking with a friend, who is a radar operator for the air national guard.  the path they were walking is very near the downtown area in our largest city, about 25 miles south from my house.  she tells me the sky that evening was dark, except for the many stars which were at that moment unobscured by clouds.  she felt something odd and was compelled to look directly overhead.  she and her friend then saw a very large, black, triangular craft with faint orangish lights, one at each corner of the craft.  she said that the craft was so dark and so quiet as to seem as if it was absorbing light and sound.  they watched as the craft moved slowly from north to south and finally disappeared from view after a few minutes.  apparently, my mother's friend was at least somewhat familiar with similar objects, but provided no information.  my mother told me about this experience immediately after it happened because our close relationship and mutual respect permit this.\r\n\r\nthis week, i had my own amazing experience, and my wife shared it with me.  on the evening december 4th, 2014 at approximately 9 p.M., i was exercising in our basement and noticed a very bright light which i could see through our basement window.  i ran up our first flight of stairs, opened the front door and stood on the porch.  before noticing any detail i felt an intense sense of dread.  i looked up toward the sky at a 45 degree angle, directly away from our house, toward vermont's highest mountain peak.  in the near distance, perhaps a half mile from where i was standing, i saw an extremely bright object, pulsating red and blue lights, bouncing around slightly.  i stood for perhaps 30 seconds or a minute watching this object, feeling transfixed but also very fearful.  i recalled in that moment some of the stories of abductees who were paralyzed prior to their close encounters, and screamed at myself mentally to turn around and go back inside.  i walked quickly inside, locked the door and ran up the next flight of stairs to our living room, where my wife was sitting and watching television.  i turned off all the lights and then the tv and told her, \"you need to see this.\"  i brought her to our picture window, oriented precisely eastward in the direction of the object, and asked, \"what is that?\"  she leaned toward the window, squinted her eyes and her mouth dropped open.  at the same moment i noticed another similar bright object to the north, but this object became a secondary consideration to us because it was partially obscured by tree branches near our window and appeared to be farther away and at a higher altitude.  i asked her to stand there and continue to watch the object for unusual flight patterns if it began to change position.  as she did this, i ran to my office to retrieve my celestron model #21035 travel telescope.\r\n\r\nwhen i returned, i noticed a light on the ground directly below the ufo, in a location that i know to be a patch of cow pasture void of any structures.  i quickly found the ufo in my telescope lens.  what i saw shocked me down to my core.  the object was disc-shaped, bright, colorful, pulsating and bouncing.  the pulsating red and blue lights appeared to come from within the craft, passing out through its walls.  i then found the light on the ground below the craft and saw that it was cylindrical, orangish-yellow and was illuminating a white angular object which sat closer to my house on the grass.  after two or three minutes, i decided that i would not see enough detail in the light and turned the telescope back toward the ufo.\r\n\r\nwhen my wife again examined the craft, she asked, \"what is that other thing...In the air, closer to us, in the bottom right corner of the view?\"  i looked and saw the corner of another, mostly black and camouflaged object, perhaps two or three hundred yards closer to us.  i watched this object for ten minutes or longer and noticed that it was slowly rocking around and up and down.  on several occasions, i could clearly see that the bright, pulsating disc was casting enough light on the angular craft to illuminate two corners of what appeared to be a triangular black craft.\r\n\r\nmy wife paced around the house, communicating irritation with me for looking at these objects with such interest at first, but eventually, after at least a full hour, parked herself on a chair near me saying, \"i feel weird...I'm scared...I don't like this.\"\r\n\r\nat some point, i noticed that the light on the ground had vanished.  then, i noticed that the pulsating disc was calmer - more stationary and less bright.  the red light, especially, was mostly or entirely gone and the craft appeared to settle into a lower-energy state.  the triangular craft remained in the same position for another thirty minutes.  immediately prior to going to bed, i saw that the disc and triangle had both changed positions.  the disc was now higher, perhaps directly above the triangle, which was now oriented with a single corner pointing downward.  suddenly, i saw the full form of the triangle, which was hovering with its underside pointing directly at my window.  i saw one faint, circular orange light at each of three corners.\r\n\r\nthe next day, i bumped into a resident who lives on the road directly opposite my house from the previous evening's activity.  this individual informed me that she had see an object that matched my description of the bright object at 9 p.M. on december 3rd and 4th.  i knew this meant that the object might return soon, and watched from my window throughout the night of december 5th.  two bright, pulsating objects appeared shortly before midnight, at least one half mile farther from my house than they had been the previous night.  i watched for over an hour as they appeared to follow a grid pattern slightly above the tree tops near a river.\r\n\r\na quick scan of the internet reveals that vermont is currently a hotspot for these phenomena.  many people have reported similar objects in my area; many more have likely seen them and remained silent.\r\n\r\ni have attached a sketch of the two objects from the night of december 4th.  i would be willing to speak with you by phone, but i must be careful not to allow my name to be associated with my report as it is presented to the public.\r\n\r\nthank you for all of your amazing work mufon!","distance":"501 Feet -

kentucky to shelbiana, kentucky, our trailing unit and first two cars were severely damaged as we struck an unknown floating or hovering object. i know it was 2:47 because my watch froze, and to this day shows that time. along with my watch the entire electrical systems on both locomotives went haywire. approaching a bend near milepost 42 in an area referred to as the wild kingdom, for the many different types of animals spotted there, my conductor and i saw lights coming from around the way. this ordinarily means another train is coming and will pass on the other track. the outlay of the area is this, the river, #1 track, #2 tracks and a straight up mountainside, carved out for the laying of these tracks. i killed our lights as not to blind the oncoming crew. as we rounded the corner our onboard computer began to flash in and out, speed recorder went nuts, and both locomotives died. alarm bells began to ring and that's when we saw the objects. apparently scanning the river for something. at least three objects had several \"search\" lights trained there, the first object hovered about 10 to 12 feet above the track.\r\n \r\nit was metallic silver in color with multiple colored lights near the bottom and in the middle. there were no windows or openings of any kind that we could see. it was 18 to 20 feet in length and probably ten feet high. with both engines dead as we rounded the corner we made little noise and the first object did not respond in time, i estimate that we hit the object at 30 mph with 16,000 trailing tons behind us. it clipped the top of our lead unit then skipped back slicing a chunk out of our trailing unit and first two coal cars. the other objects vanished.\r\n \r\nour emergency brakes had initiated due to the loss of power and we stopped approximately a mile and a half to two miles after impact. our power restored after we were stopped and we notified our dispatcher, located in jacksonville, florida of what had happened. we were told to inspect the cars to see if they'd hold the rail and try to limp into milepost cmg 60 which used to be the paintsville yard which is no longer in full operation. we checked everything out and the cab of the rear locomotive was demolished and smoking, the second two cars looked as if they had been hit with a giant hammer, but looked like they'd hold the rail.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\naerial view paintsville, ky  railroad yard\r\n \r\n \r\nwe pulled into paintsville yard at approximately 5:15 am. the huge overhead lights lining the yard were noticeably dark and the only lights came from what we assumed were railroad officials vehicles parked near the end of the track. we pulled to a stop and began unloading our grips off the wounded train. we could hear what sounded like an army of workers immediately tending to our train. vehicle doors slamming, guys running by in weird outfits and lights glaring from all directions, the one thing missing was railroad officials.\r\n \r\na guy named ferguson shook my hand and asked me to follow him into the old yard office. we did, once inside they, and by they i mean i have no idea who these people were, began to ask us hundreds of questions, they then told us for our own protection we'd be medically tested before we could leave. i asked repeatedly to talk to my road foreman or trainmaster and not only were these requests denied but they confiscated my conductor's cellular phone. hours later we were led outside the old yard office and the strange things continued to happen, the 2 locomotives and two cars were removed from the rest of the train we had brought in and my only guess was parked 4 tracks over under a huge tent like structure buzzing with activity. we were lead off the property and told, due to national security, our silence on this matter would be appreciated.\r\nwe were then put in a railroad vehicle and taken to martin, kentucky were we went through questioning again with railroad officials and were then drug tested. after all of this we were sent on to shelbiana, where we took rest for 8 hours and worked another train back to russell. working back we passed by paintsville, no sign of the engines, cars, tent, people, nothing. thanks to peter davenport nuforc http://www.Nuforc.Org/\r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or
