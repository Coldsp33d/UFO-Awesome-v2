green men in a space ship but i certainly saw something flying that i could not identify! i was having a smoke after my watch, and idly staring out to sea, as we were about five miles off the coast. after a few minutes i spotted a light above the horizon which initially i thought was maybe mars or venus, but then realised the cloud cover was too great and there were no stars visible. intrigued, i watched the light appear to hover in one spot. i thought it might have been a cab but all ours were on the flight deck and we were not expecting anything inbound. so maybe it was a local one? not when it started manoeuvring! it climbed slowly at first, in a gentle arc of about thirty degrees, which ok could have been a normal aircraft, but then it reversed course and shot away at a hell of a speed. no way was it a helicopter and it can’t have been a fixed wing aircraft because it hovered – if we still had harriers i would have put it down to that. there were no navigation lights visible just a bright, yellowish light akin to the landing light of a hawk if you get my meaning? anyway it shot off and disappeared. i thought to myself, that was a bit strange! bugger me if it didn’t come back about five minutes later! it came out of nowhere and proceeded to hover again – though it was impossible to gauge the distance because without a clue what it was i have no idea of size. it hovered, shadowing the ship it appeared for a few minutes, then climbed toward land before rapidly reversing course again, this time in a different direction. the speed of the turn was phenomenal, and the acceleration astounding. after zipping across the sky it appeared to shoot off upward and disappear again! i know it sounds like a crap entry for a creative writing course but i swear this is what i

seemed to flicker almost like a flame on a candle. another car and myself pulled over on the side of the freeway to take video of the ufos and after about 3 mins of watching them they soon started to fade away into the clouds in different directions and as they flew away their lights became dimmer. \r\n\r\nafter that i head up to a local park to see if maybe i could catch a better view and maybe see the source of were they came from. when i located the area they were hovering above i noticed what looked like smoke rising from the general area of where the ufos were hovering. the smoke seemed to settle down like as if someone put out a bonfire. \r\n\r\nafter that i headed home! \r\n\r\n\r\ni checked ucr page to see if maybe some type of chinese new year event was going on or something

my life. \r\n\r\nthese orange red amber lights. i was visiting at my in laws house talking with my mother in law, she saw them out the window and we went outside because we knew immediately it was not an airplane. \r\n\r\nfrom where we were near a golf course on a hill looking out north and it's dark in the sky so you get a very good view at night. it appeared they were coming from the west or southwest but downtown lights made it hard to see them until they were almost right over our heads. \r\n\r\nfirst it was 3 red amber lights that seemed to be in a triangular formation moving northeast, they moved silently holding altitude until they moved out of our sight. then more amber lights followed, some moving singularly others in pairs. i went and got my husband and he and my father in law came outside and watched them too. \r\n\r\nmany more lights came and did the same thing. they seemed to be gliding and were completely silent. they moved northeast towards altoona then some moved off north towards ankeny. my husband tried to take a video on his phone but it is really hard to see the lights and isn't very good. \r\n\r\nthey didn't appear to \"float\" upward, they seemed to all be around the same altitude about where a helicopter would fly, even as they appeared and then moved out of sight then new light would show up in a pair or single. but no sound at all, none. the lights we saw didn't blink or flicker it was more of a very slow pulse, a little dimmer then brighter or just a solid color all the time. we saw them over the course of maybe 5 mins or so until no more came. very weird!\r\n\r\nin total i think we saw 12 different lights. they didn't appear to be connected to each other and like i said some seemed to be flying together and others by themselves. \r\n\r\ni think it was around 5:45 or 6:00pm at night. it was dark out but not late at night. we had just got home from christmas shopping and were going to pick our kids up at my in-laws house. we had decided to stay and visit or we would have never seen the \"lights\".\r\n\r\ni wasn't drinking and what i saw were not chinese lanterns because the wind was blowing out of the north that night so they couldn't have been moving into the wind like they were. my husband thinks they are military drones (and still does) so i asked a military friend about drones. he said it is unlikely that drones would be flying together. \r\n\r\nso i don't know what they were but i wanted others to hear about what i saw in case they have an experience like this too. i was with 4 other people who saw the same thing i did and it was very weird. not scary just weird. although, the more thought i've put into it the more it has bothered me that i can't figure out what they were. anyone have any thoughts on what these could be?

artist and sailing enthusiast who in the 70's could identify every extant military aircraft...I had the redeyes!). the ground winds were 10mph from the north. there was no alarm upon sighting the ufo. i noted the time at 7:02 (i just do stuff like that!). first instinct was aircraft but quickly reconsidered by lack of movement. i was sitting on a park bench with a back and moved myself over about a foot so the ufo was against a textured concrete column. no movement at all...No wind drift, nothing! since i hadn't a scale on the craft, there was no guessing altitude or distance. if it was the size of a cola can, it would have been about 300 yards away and 150' in altitude. were it the size of a silo it could have been 12-15 miles from me. it was above the kccc which is approx  60' tall. at

quartering view and it was perpendicular the sun. the craft had no perceivable details, but again could have been very far away. there was a man sitting on bus bench between myself and the object about 35 yards away and i, not being one that shys away from engaging strangers, started walking toward him to ask if he saw it, but his bus came and i went back to the bench. i kept it in sight going
