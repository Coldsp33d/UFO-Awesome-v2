(the huge white light had looked to me like an aircraft landing light... that bright.) there were positively no red/green/white navigation lights, common to all aircraft, in their faa required locations, that i could see. the best i can simply describe this as is that it was an object with the ability to turn on or off 3 green lights in a triangle pattern, and which had the ability to turn on and off 2 small white lights and/or a large white light in front, and also the ability to turn on or off a blinking white strobe light in the rear. as a lifelong aviation enthusiast and licensed private pilot, i know airplanes inside and out, airplanes large and small, jets, helicopters, and blimps and i know what they all look like in day or night. this was like something i have never seen before. this looked like a helicopter approaching, but as we neared it, i realized it wasn't approaching but hovering. as we passed underneath, it turned off the small and big white spot lights, and turned into a green 3-lighted triangle. as we passed further underneath, the green triangle turned on a single white strobe light next to only 1 of the green lights. this was no aircraft i've ever experienced day or night. it remains to me unidentified, hence my report here now. this was an unidentified flying object hovering low above a busy city during a huge highway emergency. there must have been hundreds of witnesses to it, i'll bet many witnesses were law enforcement officers handling the freeway emergency. they couldn't have missed it! it was right over all of our heads, hovering, with an extremely bright light shining on it. the bright light did not shine down to the ground. it shone straight out ahead of the object the entire time it was turned on.

to compare by. the wife and i continued to look at them amazed at what they could be. then out of no where the first 3 leading orbs started to change shape into a triangle shape and hovered in a straight line path still heading south. the last two orb's seemed to have stopped somewhat but after the triangle shaped happened then the last two orbs headed south staying slightly behind until we couldn't see them anymore including the triangle. we headed inside. \r\n\r\n   not even 20 minutes later, i went back outside since i smoke cigarettes and my wife joined me. heading from my east side coming from the north heading south maybe about 200 to 300 ft up in the air (guessing the distance being dark outside) was a brownish object with a beige color on the shaft or what i would call a shaft in the wavy line area. heres the hard part to mention and we saw so much detail. this was a barbell shaped object about the size of almost two jet fighters put together in length and moving quickly & quietly (no sound). since we were able to view the front, side, bottom and end of this object, i can say there were no after burners on this or propeller's. it was solid but the shaft area had wavy lines & under the wavy lines was a beige - faint white color that didnt fit the main color. looked odd in other words. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

about 20 degrees above the horizon. our hearts started pounding, as we had never seen anything like this before. the objects appeared to be quite large and were travelling in a fairly tight formation as they headed toward brantford, ontario, canada. i yelled for my mother to get the camera, which was a polaroid model. we both ran outside, taking the camera with her. the objects were headed towards a thick cloud bank. i pleaded with her to shoot the picture. she was working on the focus. the first object flew into the cloud bank. she did however, get a beautiful shot of the third object. in the photo, you can faintly see the second object, glowing red in the very top right-hand corner of the picture. the third object is fantastic to see! i will be including the photo in this report. i would like to add that these objects made no sound. there were no flashing lights. this sighting changed my life and has made me a solid believer that there is something more out there. i am quite well educated, and can say with certainty that this sighting was not anything man-made. the photo is now 40 years old. it has a blemish on it, however, the object itself, is in perfect viewing condition. i

traveling west northwest in a steady line going relatively slow (in my opinion). it appeared to be the size of an aspirin (if held up to compare). the light that it was giving off was more like energy than something being emitted from a bulb or beam or something like that. it was a brilliant display of comforting green and silver light, to say the least. there were patterns on the surface, the underside) that looked to be details of it's construction. from the time we saw it to the time it flew out of our vision, approximately 3-4 minutes went by. \r\nmy emotional response to the sighting was a mix of pure happiness and falling into an existential whirlpool. i immediately hugged my coworker, whom i was not the best of friends with, and started thinking to myself how that moment in time bonds us for ever. for instance, i will never forget his name and face because this day proved to be a defining point in my belief of aliens, ufos, and coverup theories - all which i payed little attention to before this event. my sighting was special because of how clearly it was a disk flying gently through the sky. i felt happy and comfortable, like seeing this object made me feel this way. it also seemed like our thoughts could be being read or like they somehow knew we were watching them. i can't really explain in detail this feeling. \r\nagain thank you for your time in reading my account, and i hope mufon can put a definitive link to ufos and their visitations.

cigarette. i sat down  on my step and then noticed bright red lights in the sky. at first i thought they were planes but then quickly realized they were way to close together to be planes. i then stood up and walked to get closer to the objects to get a better look. the sky was dark. immediately i noticed 5 objects moving across the sky. they were a solid red color moving with no sound and made a strange formation in the sky. three of them then made a triangle like shape. the last of them 5 objects moved further. then on object one i noticed a grey like shape under the red solid light. the objects moved in a way that was not a plane. i immediately pulled out my phone to record th the objects.The red nights did not show up in the video as there was too much street lighting.  i remember saying out load \"this is so weird\". i felt scared a but but also in awe as i've never seen anything like it before. before the first object disappeared it moved down and the up rather fast. i stayed outside until all objects disappeared into the clouds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path
