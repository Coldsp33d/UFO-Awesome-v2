the area of the nuclear plant located in russellville ar about 20 or so miles from my residence. it emitted multi coloured lights as it stay stationary in the sky. for the next following 2 hours i would check on it periodically and aroud 3 am it ascended a flight path over my house and was completely outta view within 3 minutes. object had no sound and had a strange electro magnetic like feeling pulsate trough my body as it flew over me. i see this thing all the time but this time it took off. also been tracking 6 or so star like objects that appear over the mountain to the north of my home. they \"come on\" at about 7 pm and remain there still in the sky until the sun comes up. i have been watching these objects for 6 months now and they still have not moved! i have flown several robinson aircraft in my life and the phenomena i have witnessed over the past 1.5 years completely eludes explanation. they defy what we as human beings have come to believe as the theory or relativity and defies gravity and the laws of enersia (if beings are onboard). neighbours and i discuss week to week sightings often. any help understanding the sightings would be most appreciated. thank you all so much for offering a place to report and for all your hard work and follow ups. we deserve the truth and its people like you that get us one step closer everyday!","distance":"Over One

and we were traveling about 80 mph. this was around 1974 speed at your own risk. the road was straight as an arrow. with our car lights you could see about one quarter mile front and back of us.There was no way on or off the 2 lane highway because of guard rail on each side of the road. suddenly my friend started to slow down because he saw a car coming up fast behind us.I said don't worry there is no speed limit but he slowed anyway.  as the object got closer he put his hand over the rear view mirror because the light was getting very bright as the object got closer. then the object was right on our bumper and the lights were blinding. there was no sound. me being in the passenger side i began to turn aroud to my left. my friend said don't do that it will look suspicious,  he still thought it could be a cop but i knew it was not. as i turned i saw a big round light that was on the left side of the back of the car go up in the air with a smaller light under it. this looked to me the way a helicopter would take off. at that moment i yelled stop the car and a second later jumped out of the door as the car was still moving. i looked in the direction of where the object went and saw nothing or heard nothing. with our car lights you could see perfectly in every direction around the road. so i do not know what it was but know it was not a car, plane or helicopter.  and again there was no noise what so ever. this event happened 40 years ago but feels like a minute ago. we just looked at each other and drove off.","distance":"20 Feet or

am.  after i got the water i looked out my living room window (which i often do to look at the stars) and saw an object hovering above the mountain range the window looks out upon.  what caught my eye was the size of the object...Much larger than a star, and alternating colors through red to orange to yellow to white then back to red.  i enjoy looking at the stars and am somewhat familiar with the night sky (even took an astronomy class in college)... so i knew this could not be a planet and was too large to be a star.  there was not sure if there were radio/cell towers on the mountain, but this was too high and too large as well.  i considered it being a plane or satellite, but it did not show movement.\r\n\r\nout of curiosity i went to my computer and searched the internet for anything that might explain the light, and found nothing.  i got a snack and 30 minutes later (at 3:30 am) i checked out the window again, and the light/object was still in the same position.  if it had been a star or planet, the rotation of the earth would have changed it's position.  if it was a plane or satellite or object in orbit, it would also have changed it's position.  it had not....It was still in the same position above the mountain range....Still flashing/changing colors as before.  in addition, the colors were very vivid and bright, and the color change was total...It wasn't fading in and out, or gradually changing color, it was one solid color, then another, then another....Seemingly in a pattern.  at that point i went back to bed since i had to be up for work in a few hours and the object didn't seem to be changing any, just stationary and changing colors.  i considered that it could have been a helicopter, but it would had to have been extremely large to appear the size i saw from the distance i saw it. in addition, i grew up next to an air force base and this did not resemble anything i had seen before.  i even stuck my head out the door and listened to see if i could hear any noise the object was making, but did not hear anything.\r\n\r\nthe next morning when i awoke, i immediately when back to the living room window and did not see anything above the mountain range which could have explained the object/light.  no cell/radio towers, nothing.  in addition, it was a cold, crystal clear night as was the morning after.  i did another internet search that day and in the following days after and did not find any reports of any kind that resembled what i saw or could explain what i saw.","distance":"Over One

the way to eat out my wife noticed these lights and we stopped to record them! my youngest son was also present as we observed the brilliant lights . the cell phone was a cheap lg and does little justice to the event, aside from the fact it was taken an hour or more prior to my already posted video of the same event on a separate camera . felt very magnetized to this viewing and was unsuprised by the display also very definite that my naked eyes were not witnessing a normal aircraft or helicopter / floating lantern due to the powerful wind that was coming directly from the direction of the

way home.  she noticed 3 lights in the sky\r\nas she was coming  home from annapolis and still at least 5 miles away.  \r\ni went into our back yard and noticed the 3 lights to the sw and slowly moving south. \r\nthey were low in the sky and just  small spots in the sky.  i could not tell how distant,\r\nbut seemed to be a few miles.  i would guess perhaps 3-10 miles. \r\n \r\nbecause they were very strange,  i decided to go get binoculars to look at them.  they appeared to\r\nbe like lighted donuts,  but kind of fuzzy like a smoke ring,  but with the fat shape of a donut.  \r\nthe setting sun was probably creating the light coming from them.\r\n \r\nsince i had not seen anything like that before,  i went into the house to get my digital camera.\r\ni set it at 10x zoom and got one photo before they disappeared entirely.  unfortunately,  i was\r\na little too late.  \r\n \r\ni have attached that photo.  you can slightly see two of the three lights.  one looks like a little\r\nlight at the tip end of a tree branch near the middle of the photo.  another is about 8 o'clock \r\nfrom that one in the branches.  if you zoom in,  you can sort of see the donut shape.  when i first saw \r\nthem closer to me,  the angle was better and the donut shape was more discernible.  \r\n \r\ntotal time from when i got my wife's call until i took that picture was probably 5-8 minutes. \r\n \r\ni don't believe in aliens,  so i suspect there is a rational explanation to this.  but,  i have never seen\r\nanything like it in my 73 years,  and, as a former pilot,  i watch the sky more than most people.    \r\n \r\nthe closest thing i have ever seen to this were \"sundogs\" but they were always quite different than\r\nthis.   these did not appear to be like any aircraft i have ever seen,  even lighter than air types.\r\n ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

light. noticed it appeared to be coming my way. it was moving slowly in a straight line, and eventually made its way directly over me. there was mo sound at any time. nothing but the light was visible as it was so bright. i watched it the entire time, and watched it as it flew away. constant, extremely bright light entire time. light appeared goldish-orangish to white. at first, i assumed it was a small plane, as county airport is nearby and planes fly over all the time during day and at night. but the bright light stuck me as not a plane, so i watched it at first thinking it was so bright as it was coming in my direction. discovered it was coming in my direction, but noticed it moving to slow to be a small prop plane, and noticed that the light stayed constantly bright. there was no other light, no blinking, no sound. it's speed did not ever appear to change either. realized i was seeing something that i didn't know what it was. watched until it disappeared through the trees in my backyard. moved from south, southwest to north, northwest, in apparent straight line; appeared to maintain the same distance from the ground the entire time; i'm guessing 500 feet high. still not sure what i saw. thought it could be drone due to the speed (i think that they can fly much slower than a piloted plane), but why would a drong have a single bright light calling attention to itself. i hope to hear someone else saw the same and maybe got a picture. have checked the web, but no mention so far. besides being chilled from the cold night air, it was a cool thing, but sort of freaky too. i went inside and told my wife and son. they seemed to be skeptical, and i don't blame them, but i know i saw something that wasn't anything like i've ever seen before. and reluctant as i am to say anything, i thought i should. i don't think i saw some alien craft (i'm just too skeptical of that), nor some phenomenon of nature. but, whatever it was, it was definitely out of the norm. tomorrow, i would like to call the county airport just a mile and learn if they picked anything up on radar, or have some explanation.","distance":"101-500

similar to a meteor as it had a long flaming tail moving constantly but slightly left to right and back again as it crossed above but moving much slower than a meteor as it crossed the early evening sky. it would be hard to determine with certainty how high this object was above us but i would guess the object was at least a mile or above the ground it seemed to be arching slightly downwards as it crossed the sky. no sound was heard as the object passed overhead. i mentioned to my neighbors and their friends who were also outside if they are seeing what i do and all confirmed my sighting. five others besides myself watched as the object crossed the sky. the object took 5 or six seconds to exit our field of view but just before doing so behind the rooftops of nearby houses the object made a sudden change of direction before disappearing beyond our field of view.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path

5:59 or 6 pm central time. as i approached the intersection of cason lane, a light in the sky to the east/northeast caught my attention.  it appeared to be at least a few miles from me.  at first i assumed it was a plane but quickly changed my assumption to a meteor, as it began to appear to be a white to yellow streak, but then the streak seemed to resolve to a trail with what appeared to be a orange fireball heading east at the head of it.  of course it would still appear to be a meteor, but it seemed to be moving too slow and burning too long, as i observed it in this state for nearly 20 seconds.  i was further confounded when it took a sudden turn toward the south, still leaving a trail.  i only saw it for another 3 or 4 seconds before i lost it behind some houses and trees.  i hurriedly crossed the street and attempted to relocate it but did not.  after dwelling on it for a few minutes, i began to have a horrible feeling that it may have been an airplane that had somehow caught fire.  however, over the last few hours i have checked local news sites for news of a plane emergency or crash and have found nothing.  i decided to report it here, hoping someone else may have seen it or even filmed it.  i did not attempt to photograph it because i was in the car driving and figured my phone wouldn't get a good pic or video anyway.","distance":"Over One
