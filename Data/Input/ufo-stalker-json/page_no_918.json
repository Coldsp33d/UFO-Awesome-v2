the time was around 3:00 am. suddenly i saw three bright lights off in the distance and thought it could be the flashlights from people camping as we live on a mountain. then one light, the largest, sped up across and down so fast i knew immediately these were not campers or kids playing around. the distance the lights traveled up and down would assure anyone no human can move that fast!  there was no noise, nothing but the lights.  my mind was confused, i couldn't imagine what was out there, at the same time i felt amused almost entertained and then scared the more i watched them. i was speechless as my friend kept asking, \"are you alright?\" the orbs or circular lights totaled three in all, i think, unless the one that came up to my house was a fourth one. the three i saw all looked identical in shape, color, and put off a softer light or aura around them. they moved so fast it was crazy. i turned away from the window, scared, then suddenly a bright light covered the house and i reopened the blinds after shutting them to look.  i  new because i could feel this object was just hovering to my right. then it was gone and i was back on the bed talking on the phone. i felt really tired and was asleep shortly after this incident.  \r\n\r\ni must add; when i was around twenty-two years old i was told i had been kidnapped at the age of four, when we lived in ca.  the story from my mother and my sister seemed far too short and very rehearsed.  this was later confirmed to me by a few psychologists. the story only changed by my father and it regarded the time period i was missing. my mother said three hours my dad said three days. i only bring this up because years after this and during a conversation i had with someone on the board of ufo abductions (unbenounced to me)informed me i had been abducted at that age not kidnapped.  he assured me i had all the \"trademarks\" of an abductee, i thought he was crazy.  turns out what he said to me was no crazier than how my life would play out!  i called an organization, trying to reach out to anyone regarding constant night terrors and waking every morning at 3:00 am since i was a child. in all honesty i would not be surprised if i had more encounters. i think once people are chosen, for whatever reason, there's not much you can do. whether these are spiritual encounters, as some people believe, or alien encounters it makes little difference, your life will never be the same. \r\n\r\nwhile reading what information your site accepts i had no idea i could submit art work.  there are some drawings i have done over the years that i do not understand myself, one in particular.  perhaps i can post them another time.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500

the conversation started out normal, he father stated \"good morning and is it cold enough for you\". i relied to him and the next thing that came out of his mouth was \"do you see the ufo in the east sky\". my thought at first was oh boy my father has lost his marbles because i am traveling east and don't see anything.  plus i'm almost 40 and never not once believed in ufos or anything along that long. as i drove a little down the road rounded the curve and got out from behind the trees i got the shock of my life there it was sitting so beautiful in the sky shinning so proudly, the straight up and down shinny object my father was talking about.  as i drive the object appears to be just hovering around the flintville area.  i thought ok i'm going to make it to the store stop and take a picture, which that didn't happen because now the object was behind me. i made my way onto highway 64 heading to winchester where i work,called my mother because now i'm excited for seeing such a thing.  as i'm on the phone with my mother in the right outside the huntland i notice two more cigar shaped objects over the keith springs mountain area.  i saw them the whole time i drove down highway 64 until i turned on the road i worked on.  i worked a nine hour shift that day and got off at 4:30 pm.  jumped on highway 64 heading back west, called my mother once again, she telling me what the doctor said about my son that day.  as i rounded the curve on the 64 i saw the three cigar shaped objects all together now in the west sky...Hours later after the first sighting and them separate.  i told my mother and see wanted picture i pulled off of the highway took two pictures of the objects, but didn't like the quality because they were too far away. i called my mother back and told her i was going to drive further up the road and get a better picture of these three objects. a minute and half into this conversation the three objects disappeared into thin air as if they never were there.\r\n\r\nplease note you will have to zoom in to see the two that are going side to

thereafter the object pivoted to a 10 o'clock position and then ascended into cloud cover at what appeared to be double the speed rate of an airplane, yet much slower than a military fighter jet.\r\n\r\ni am willing to speak to a mufon representative to show my exact location etc. i can also sketch what i viewed to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\n[name

lights . each formation consisted  of 6 or 10 craft.  we watched as they proceeded to put on an air show . it was obvious that this was a demonstration for someone . the actions of these delta formations was extreme in speed and directional changes . they would go to the stars and then return to earth, then back  to what appeared to be the main stage overhead, then dash to the stars . i remember that at some point they returned to earth , which due to the topography we could not see directly.We could see a glow that was beyond the arroyos, i think that is the term ,as the land was dry,baked and consisting of rises and gullies that we had to climb up and over only to find another gulley. i believe these are the result of rain and erosion. we eventually gave up , this was44 years

outside of shinnston, wv.  it was around 19:30 when i saw the lights out in the distance.  i noticed two white lights above a hill.  they looked like headlights.  it was about as high as a cell tower.  i thought it might be for a while because the lights were staying in one place. something didn’t seem quite right with it. i pointed it out to my sister.  she agreed it didn’t look right. we became transfixed on this light.  it was hard to concentrate on driving.\r\n\r\n     we rounded a turn and the lights are now on our right.  we’re both staring at these lights suspended above the hill. we are now about a mile from where we first saw the lights.  then the object started moving. it flew over the road to our left an unknown distance in front of us.  we began to feel uneasy.  as it flew over the road something came out of the object.  it looked like a fireball.  it was attached to the object because any move the object made it did too, but it never returned to the object.  the object turned back toward us and flew directly over us.\r\n\r\n     i had my window down with my head halfway out the window, and i couldn’t make out any shape to the object.  the radio was off, and i couldn’t hear any sound coming from the object.  i opened the moonroof of the truck and my sister got a very good look at the lights, and she said that she couldn’t make out anything on it either.  it was like it was there, but not.  it’s something that i can’t quite find the words to describe.  i went and turned around at a diner that was right up the road.  when we came back it was gone.\r\n\r\n     we dismissed it as probably an airplane, and we were overreacting.  we went into town and got what we needed.  on the way back, we used i-79n to fairmont.  there was a small plane that was trying to line up for landing at the north central west virginia airport.  it flew over the interstate and made a sharp turn similar to that the object made earlier.  this is when the differences in the two became apparent.  \r\n\r\n    one, the plane had a lot more lights than the object had earlier in the night.  the plane had red and green lights that were clearly visible.  two, the plane was faster than our object.  finally, the plane’s turn was nothing like our object’s turn.  the plane didn’t have the maneuverability the object did.  when he plane turned it banked to one side.  whereas, our object stayed on a flat plane the entire time.  the plane went a great distance to make a turn.  ours made the turn in an instant.  it moved much more gracefully than the plane did.\r\n\r\n     i don’t know what i saw.  i do know that the object was less than 500 feet above us, and neither of us could make out any shape to the object.  i also know that whatever came out of the object didn’t appear to go back to the object.  i don’t know what it was or if there is physical evidence out there.  there is a public trail over there.  i plan to go out this weekend to search for anything that might have come down.

and i didn't think much of it other than being a little strange it was going up and not down or across.  then just seconds later from where it had faded out, it appeared again and shot straight back to the east and faded out again.  that really shocked me.  then it appeared again and it shot straight up and to the west and disappeared.  this all took place in a matter of about 10-15 seconds.  i am a skeptic, but i know what i saw was strange and would like an explanation.  no technology we have could move as fast as this and falling/shooting stars do not change direction.

it was not possible for an object that was gold-copper and flashing randomly a blue-white light to go at phantom speeds of fifty thousand miles per hour. then, all of sudden, the gold-copper object was getting faster than before. my devices, suddenly, told me, that, the gold-copper object was now going at phantom speeds of fifty-seven thousand and five hundred miles per hour. it was fifteen to twenty minutes later, that, suddenly, the object suddenly stopped, for no reasons, said. with the telescope, i swear, i could see the object, it was a gold-copper rectangular object with windows! windows! how's that possible?! how is it, that, what i'm seeing, is possible?! it couldn't be a \"flying saucer\"! a \"flying saucer\"!!! upon underneath the windows, where, i could also swear, there was some movement, i saw where the blue-white lights came from. the blue-white lights came from exterior circular objects, that, were underneath the square windows. these exterior circular objects that were flashing blue-white lights were part and attached to the gold-copper rectangle with square windows. suddenly, i, saw another pair of movement, but couldn't see through the windows, but i could swear to myself, that these beings in the gold-copper rectangle were, physically, human, or at least, humanoid. then, all of sudden, a smaller cube object, came off the gold-copper rectangle's back. the cube was made of some white metallic alloys, and, it was big as the apollo lunar module, though, much smaller than the gold-copper rectangle object itself. the cube was going at phantom speeds of twenty-five thousand miles per hour, which shocked me. suddenly, the cube, by my calculations, was going to land in the small town of gillette, here in new jersey. i, suddenly, got into my car and drove to gillette, but then something popped in my mind. how's this also possible that no one else, but, me is hearing and seeing this?! how, and, why, not others?! when, i, got to gillette, there were some cars driving pass me, and, one person honked me in his car. i waved backed, but he'd drove away, normally. then, suddenly, the white cube was now above me. upon, my closer examinations, the white cube was hovering above me, then, suddenly, beams of blue-white lights appeared, and, then, to my shocked face, a humanoid appeared. the humanoid was wearing a silver-chrome skin-tight jumpsuit-like spacesuit with a white metallic space helmet. the face of the humanoid couldn't be seen through the space helmet, because, it look like a one-way or a two-way mirror circular glass upon the space helmet. also, upon the back of the space helmet-spacesuit was, what to me, appeared to be two white rectangular tanks. i asked the humanoid about them, it told me that, in an almost strange language, that it was argon and nitrogen tanks. then, i looked at the belt of the humanoid's spacesuit, and, also about it, because, the belt of the humanoid's spacesuit was odd. for example, the middle of the belt was in the shape of a cube and the rest was written in a strange language around it. the humanoid, then, put its left hand around my face, touching my face, for no reasons. the humanoid said, \"what are you\"? i, being professional, said that i'm a astrophysicist. the humanoid then, again, for reasons unknown, showed me its hands. the humanoid's hands had six, perfectly formed and functioning, fingers on each of the humanoid's hands. the humanoid, then, pulled out a small spherical device from the belt. the humanoid then said something to the sphere, which glowed a glowing and pulsating red color when the humanoid talked to it. the humanoid said, this device, captures and transmits tachyons. then, suddenly, the humanoid returned to its cube and blasted off, knocking me off my feet. suddenly, i blacked out. then, what appeared to be a few hours later, i stand up, and i saw no trace of evidence of what had happened, so i got to my car and droved home. a few days later, someone, was knocking on my door. when, i, answered it, three men in black clothing came upon me with their black sunglasses. the middle of the three men spoke to me and said that nothing happened in the early morning of halloween. i was confused. why, and how?! suddenly, the right man pulled out a black gun and pointed at my face, while, the left man pulled out a small pocketknife and pointed at my throat. the middle man said that they can make me disappear, if i don't tale anyone about halloween morning. i said, sure, then the three man got angry at me and, in a union, promised to not tell. i, scared, said sure. then, the three men said, again, in a union, that they know where i live and where i work at. then they droved off in a black van with windows completely covered up. that's why i'am here.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"02:15:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":61586,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.6741134,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11212014-0003","longitude":-74.4666778,"occurred":1414750500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectangular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1416565336000,"summary":"Halloween nightmare.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"07059","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":21,"locationName":"Gillette, New Jersey","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:81461"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":918}
