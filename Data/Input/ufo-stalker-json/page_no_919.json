that day from east to west.  before the sun set that evening i noticed that we were no longer within sight of land.  late that night, probably 1am or later i went out on to the balcony.  there were stars in the sky but, it was a dark night and i couldn't tell where the ocean and sky met.  all of the sudden i observed a very bright, very, very large light on the horizon off of the bow of the ship on the starboard side.  the light was not close but off on the horizon.  if flashed like an explosion and was huge lighting up most of the horizon.  it brightened up for a few seconds and then dimmed down for a few seconds.  the whole event was about ten seconds.  there was no sound whatsoever that i could hear.  the light was totally orange and seemed to disappear under the water, although that could have been an optical illusion.  \r\n\r\ni went back into the cabin and turned on the tv to see what our location was.  the television in our cabin indicated that we were over a deep ocean trench on our way to grand cayman.  if there were other witnesses i wouldn't know about it although i suspect that the crew on the navigation deck probably saw it as it was in front of the ship.   \r\n\r\ni cannot be certain of the hour.  i was sleeping and woke up and wanted to go outside on the balcony for a while.  i didn't take a watch and had no way to see what time it was.  \r\n\r\nearlier in the evening, as the sun went down i was sitting on the balcony watching the sun set and a passenger jet at high altitude go by.  i observed a very fast aircraft go by at high altitude.  it seemed to me to be a conventional aircraft as it flew in a straight line but, the speed was astounding compared to the passenger jet that was also in the sky.  i have no reason to assume that it had anything to do with the aforementioned event involving the bright light on the horizon.  \r\n","distance":"Over One

were returning home from church (which is located in marquette, mi).  we reside in a location called arnold, michigan; which is located approximately 40 miles south of marquette.  the highway we were traveling to reach arnold, is known as county road 557.\r\n\r\nit was roughly 16 miles down this road (heading south), that she and i both spotted a very bright light in the sky, located to the right of the vehicle.  initially i thought it could be a spotlight shining up from a local camp we were nearing, but upon passing the camp i realized it was far too bright for a spotlight to make that kind of illumination.\r\n\r\nwe rounded a corner and lost sight of the light for a few seconds, it then appeared to the left of the vehicle further ahead; approximately 50-100 feet above the treeline.  i pulled the vehicle over when there was a break in the trees, and it could be spotted more easily.  after observing the light for about 20 seconds, i felt rather assured that it was not moving, but rather hovering over the trees (note, there are no residences, camps, or buildings of any type in the area this was spotted; only dense forest).  i put down my driver side window all of the way, sticking my head out to listen for any type sound that my be emitted from this object; but it was silent.  i also noted there were very random flashings of smaller (much smaller) lights flashing around the lower portion of where the main bright light was located.  these were red, orange, and green in color.  the bright light we initially spotted however, remained steady.  \r\n\r\napproximately 10 more seconds into this visual and auditory observation (my head still out of the window), the object suddenly and very rapidly darted to the north (the direction we had just been traveling from). the speed at which i will not try to estimate, but it was not fast enough that my eye could not be kept on it.  but i can say with certainty it appeared to be faster than what a plane would travel.  (we do have an airport, sawyer international, which is located in the town of gwinn...Planes do not typically come in from this direction to land however).\r\n\r\nat this juncture, i had not said much aloud.  although i was feeling rattled and a bit unsure of what we were witnessing, i did not want my daughter to be scared. i do remember saying, \"what is that?\"  \"it looks like it's not moving.\" she must have sensed my unease though, because she asked in a shaky tone if we \"could go now\".  i put up the window, told her it was probably an airplane, and continued down the road.  there was no sight of the object in the rear view mirror from what i could see.\r\n\r\nmy adrenaline was pumping; i do not discount anything being possible in this universe, but personally (until that moment at least), i had not subscribed to the belief in ufo's.  the next thing that happened has shifted my thinking.\r\n\r\nwe traveled on, my daughter in the back saying we had to tell papa (that would be my father), about the bright light in the sky.  i was in the front saying a prayer for god to calm my nerves!  we were approximately 3 to 4 miles down the road from where we had pulled over, when again, the bright light was up ahead to our left.  this particular part of the highway is a stretch about 1/2 mile long; i could catch sight of the illumination every now and then through the trees as we neared it.  as we came closer, i did not stop this time, but did slow down to look.  as before, it hovered about 50-100 feet above the treeline to the left of the vehicle; the bright light was still radiant and constant, with the other (smaller) lights flashing at random intervals.  as we passed it (going maybe 25 mph) it was clear this object was 1) not an airplane 2) stationary 3) a replica of what we had just seen and/or 4) possibly the same object we had witnessed.  passing by, the object did not dart away, or move in any fashion as it had last time. we traveled the reamining seven miles home without any further sightings. \r\n\r\nthis second sighting a few miles down the road, really cemented the experience.  later that evening, after my daugher was asleep, i hit the internet to find more information about ufo sightings in michigan's upper penninsula.  it was astounding to see how many people have documented situations and descriptions similar to my own. there was some hesitation with sharing this sighting, but after giving it some thought, i realized that it is prior testimonies that are helping me digest what it is we saw that evening; and maybe this story can help another come forward.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":61570,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.2188639,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11202014-0012","longitude":-87.48719349999999,"occurred":1416460020000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1416525020000,"summary":"Spotted in area known for dense forest; one rather bright light with occassional flashes of smaller lights ","tags":["lights","flash"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"49841","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Gwinn, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:81878"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Cave Creek","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was just getting out of the pool on a sunny afternoon; as i was watching some storm clouds forming in the eastern sky, i saw a white, star-like object come out of the east (above the clouds). it was circular or orb-like and it was not glowing or glinting in the sun. as i watched, the object abruptly stopped in the air and hovered for a few moments. it then took a sharp, 90 degree turn towards my right (south) before it stopped again. it then took another sharp turn and headed back towards the east (stopped again). once more, it turned sharply and drifted to the north (my left). this time it held this position for several minutes. the clouds were drifting towards the south, south west, but the object was not apparently impacted by the force of the winds (ground level winds 6mph). after a few more minutes time, a second similar-looking object came out of the west and headed east (flew directly over me). this one seemed smaller and possibly had a cyan-colored light on it (it was difficult to discern...It seemed blurred/fuzzy for some reason). this object must have been travelling diagonally upwards because it started below the cloud level and gradually disappeared into the cloud. after the second object disappeared, the first object moved remarkably rapidly (diagonally downward, about a 50 degree angle) towards the second object. they (presumably) met together in the cloud. i did not see the objects depart nor have i seen them since.\r\nhad the objects been on the ground, i estimate they would have been rather large, possibly the size of a mid-size plane considering how well i could see them from the ground. the first object was only moving in a certain quadrant of the sky and i'm not sure if i can accurately gauge the speed at which it was travelling between stops. from the ground, it appeared to move at a similar rate of speed an airplane does. if it helps to determine the height of the storm cloud (which the object hovered over), the temperature was 101 degrees f, dew point 59 degrees f, cumulus with an anvil top.

saw strange clouds forming over highway 575 south of jasper. at that time i remembered reading about ufos using clouds to hide or recharge their systems so, on a whim, i took three photos but forgot to look at them until now. it is important to note that we could not see the object in real time when the event actually occurred. it was only today, three weeks later, that i saw what appears to be a huge ufo, 800 to 1000 yards across, entering and hovering in the clouds. i took the pictures with my cell phone from the passenger seat of our car. the pictures are in sequence, taken several seconds apart. fyi, i am a retired air force officer and pilot who has flown all over the world, with a phd in business from a highly respected school.","distance":"Over One

2014 about to get on i-265 e when i saw an odd bright white glowing triangular shaped light in the night sky ahead of us but a little towards the left.  it was a very well defined triangle shape pointed towards earth.  it was one fourth the size of the moon.  i wondered if it could be a fireball but it didn't seem to be moving much and the shape was a little odd being clearly triangular.  i couldn't watch it but for a few seconds when i had to look back at traffic to get on the freeway.  but this is not the primary object i am reporting on.\r\n\r\nafter we got on the freeway i couldn't turn my head enough to see the triangular light anymore.  but it got me looking skyward.  after a few minutes of driving on i-265 the highway turns northward - as it did we saw another object in the cloudy night sky directly in front of us.  this one was a bright white roundish to oval light with two much smaller lights on either side.  the big middle light did not blink.  the smaller ones did.  i'm not sure what color they were - mostly white-ish but there was some color to them.  the object appeared to be hovering.  what really shocked us about it was when a white oval-ish light dropped from below it.  i was driving and watching the road - so i can't say for 100% that it emanated from the brighter larger 3 light object but it was near enough that it probably did.  if descended straight down in front of us slower than any fireball or shooting star would have done.  it was not a shooting star even though i know there is a meteor shower going on.  it was a slower and larger moving object.  halfway down the light went off.  we couldn't observe it any longer as it was dark outside and cloudy as well.  the descending object was about 10 times the size of a shooting star.  and it didn't look like a meteor as it appeared to drop from the sky - not flying across and was slower than a meteor and there were clouds - not a clear sky behind it.  there was no sound associated with it and there were no little flashes of light as it descended.  the descending object was not \"bright\" like the 3 light object.  the descending object was a pale white light.  it did not resemble a fireball.  as it descended it's shape and brightness did not vary until the light just went out.  the 3 light object was about 15 times larger than the descending one.  the descending object really looked like it dropped down.\r\n\r\nso yes it shocked me a little.  i didn't think to look at the time or where we were on the freeway.  we were probably near where taylorsville rd crosses the freeway.  as we drove down the freeway we passed under the larger 3 light object.  the time we were able to watch the 3 light object was about 1 minute.  the object that descended we watched for about 3 seconds and then the light went out when it was about halfway down.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

flight landed on 6/25/2013 at 10:50 or 10:55pm.  i had to drive us back so i was in the drivers seat.  my husband hurt his shoulder and couldn't drive back.  after we left the airport and turned onto highway 71 where there are stop lights along the highway, i believe we only drove about a mile on the 71 when we stopped at the light.  huge lights caught my eye out the window directly above our car.  i said to everybody, what's that up there, look!  i wanted to get out but my husband's shoulder was in too much pain (skateboarding injury the day before) and he was grouchy and wanted to go home.   all my kids looked up through the windows too and saw what i saw.  \r\nit was huge, looked to be triangular shaped because of the location of the lights.  one at the point of the triangle and lights angled down on either side. it seems like there were either 5 or 7 lights that i saw, but not sure.  i do recall seeing to the left of me out the window and in front through the windshield and could only make out a triangle shape because of the location of the lights. i saw very large bright lights, round, but could not tell if if was a solid object hovering above.  i didn't have much time since we were at a stoplight.  it was massive in size and we did not hear any sounds of any kind. we did not have the windows rolled down though.  we had to drive off when the light turned green but i recall trying to keep looking through my window as i was driving but couldn't watch for more than a few seconds.  i do not know if it stayed there for a while or flew off.  i believe it was a ufo.  i was very excited about witnessing this.  i am a believer in et's. \r\n\r\ni wish i could talk to someone else that saw this too.  anyone out there that saw this that same night?\r\n\r\nmy kids remember this as well as i do.  it was awesome.  only wish i had gotten out and been able to take photos or just watch a while longer. \r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

appeared. it had to be, i don't know, at least the size of probably a hundred miles in height and width. it was hard to tell because it was very far from the earth, possibly thousands of miles away but it was hard to tell because there was nothing to give it any kind of scale.\r\nto me it looked planet like because i have never scene any flying object that size ever.The object appeared very very far away but still huge. i was stunned because it wasn't there,then it was there, then it was gone. i took two pictures of it before it disappeared. there were about 20 or so people around, but no one else saw or said anything so i said nothing. the whole experience happened so fast that i almost couldn't believe it. the thing is the pictures are from my phone so there crappy, so i'm hoping you
