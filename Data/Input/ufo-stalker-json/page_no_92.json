shaped object coming from the north to south direction at a  altitude of  approximately 500-600ft and a distance of about the same. at about the same time we both said out loud “ufo”  when it saw us it slowed down but not like anything we could comparison it to as it  defied gravity. it was a highly polished crome in color, no  identifiable fuselage none. no wings,no tail, no visible engines or exhaust trail, no sound,no lights or windows. the horses were not nervous in anyway but we did observe the air was muffled and no other sounds could be heard. we have a major highway not to far from this sighting and could not hear the highway in the background. after many years in the military i  realized as my wife did this was not ours. after seeing us it picked up speed but again  defying gravity as we know propulsion by today’s standards, and continued on a southwest direction then changed to a  deliberate more south westerly direction. i did  scramble to take pictures from my iphone which i still have but really missed the mother of all shots but still have pictures  from a distance. for my wife and i this has been a unbelievable experience and have shared it with many of our close friends and family but it has changed us forever we have always known we are not alone in this is not the first time we have spotted objects in the sky.But never this close, this was a in yout face  experience. took as many pictures until it was gone. we talked about it all the way home and at times in even saying “did we see just see what we truly saw a ufo” ? who do you go to? who do you show the pictures to, who is going to believe us? all the normal feelings people have. i do have  difficulty sleeping but has not effectived my wife that way. as you observe something like this in seconds you process by all that one can and even overwhelmed like seeing a unicorn and trying to come to terms in belief of what you just saw was real, and want to tell the world but afraid of ridicule, this has changed me and my wife forever. we want the truth, and seek answers and willing to help others on this if need to be.We are both retired so we have the time. a  profound experience

passenger window (north) a bright white light in the clouds caught my attention, it came down through the clouds rapidly, and there was a hole in the clouds where it came through, like it pierced the clouds and left a hole. then it seemed to maintain that altitude for a second or two, not long enough to say that it was hovering because it started to move southward after it came down. it kind of came down, paused a second and started moving south. there was a glowing trail where it came down through the clouds. the object appeared black and round, i could only see the shape against the clouds above it, so i don't know for sure if it was actually black or not but it was definitely round. it had 2x visible lights, steady lights no pulsing no blinking. the object started moving south from my passenger side across the drivers side of the car, it was no longer leaving a trail and the lights began blinking as it was passing over, which made me think maybe it was a plane. but then it suddenly shot back north, back to where it had come down through the clouds, and the 2x lights got much brighter when that happened. then it changed direction again and started heading back south again, at that point the 2x lights went to 1x solid bright white light, there was no more blinking, then it just shot off southward crazy crazy fast, and i lost sight of it. it was completely gone in under a second. much too fast to have been a plane or drone i think? after it was out of sight i noticed the glowing trail where it came through the clouds was still there and still glowing. it did not leave any other trail at all, just where it came through the clouds. it is possible that moon light may have been shining through the spot where it came through the clouds? but it really didn't look like that, it looked more like a glow, which faded away after about 2-minutes. i didn't hear any noise, didn't see any other planes in the sky, just a strange object that shifted direction rapidly and then took off crazy fast. gotta say the glow it left in the clouds was creepy, it was like a whitish golden glow. the clock in the car said 7:20pm but i think out of habit i looked at my watch, it is a digital battery powered watch (casio) and it was completely dead, no display on it at all. i have no idea if that has anything to do with the object or not? but i found it odd that it died at that moment. i had checked my watch when i left my brothers house at 7pm and again when i crossed over highway 234, which was only a couple minutes before i saw the object, so the watch was definitely working, and now it's definitely dead. nothing else appears to have been effected, just the watch. may not be related at all. i'm pretty sure our current flight technologies can't replicate what i saw? the sighting was on highway 94 heading north past highway 234 before it meets up with highway 15 north. my initial feeling upon seeing it was curiosity, trying to figure out what could pierce clouds like that, then when i saw the blinking lights i thought it was just a plane, but then it totally changed direction and shot northward again, and the lights changed, my exact words were \"what the hell is that\"? when the light got brighter and it shot off southward i was actually feeling a bit tense, not quite fear, just a bit tense. i had a 90-minute drive to get home and i spent the entire drive trying to come up with explanations, and i can't think of anything at all to explain what i saw, so i classified it as unidentified. when i got home i looked up your web site and filed this report. i hope this helps, i hope i've provided you with enough

travelling slowly down the road, i looked at the houses to my right, and i immediately saw a saucer shaped object, flying just above the roofs of the houses. it was moving as slowly as we were. i then told my friend to stop the vehicle. we were at an intersection. when the car stopped, the saucer also stopped and hovered about 20-30 ft in the air, on the side of us. i got out of the car and stood in the intersection. i observed this saucer shaped disk,light silver in color. i also observed different color lights rotating on the bottom of the saucer, as well as a blinking red light on the very top of the craft.I also observed 3 or 4 windows, that i can describe as round portholes that are usually on an old ship. this disk was just hovering, with absolutely no sound. as i stood outside the

immediately took off into the sky. i kept my eye on it and we were actually following it, although it kept climbing at the same time. we were able to follow it until it disappeared into the sky. i felt a little nervous, but ecstatic at the same time, after observing such a thing.My friend and i decided that we weren't going to tell anybody about this because we figured the government, and especially gafb, would just deny it. however, we drove back to hazleton park, which is located in the same area of the observation, and close to gafb. all of a sudden, we heard and observed several jets taking off from the base, circling the area, and appearing to do touch and goes. this was not normal for this to occur, especially at night.\r\n\r\nsometime in 2010, i was talking to two of my co-workers, one of which grew up in that same neighborhood. he told the other friend of mine about a ufo he saw around hazleton park back in 1974. he talked about all of the jets suddenly starting to take off also. come to find out, he saw the same ufo and really never talked about it before.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

noticed the silence and then a hum. stopped, listened, couldn't really discern where sound was coming from and then looked up. huge black triangle just floating directly overhead, blocking out a great portion of the sky.  it was jet black and the stars/milky way provided its silhouette.  if it had landed it'd have taken up 2 acres.  it was moving very very slow, maybe 10-15mph. i don't remember any lights, more a black triangular void in the stars of the  sky, emitting a super quiet hum that sounded like it was coming from everywhere, and it just went right on by moving nne. i kinda realized the moment was huge and went inside and my mom was waiting for me. i rushed her to the north windows of the house and she saw \"something\" (according to her) but by that time the object was getting too far away to see anything really, especially considering it was black.  it's absolutely one of the coolest experiences i've ever had but so sad there was not someone with me to see it.  finding the

seeing. 5 bright lights seemed to be in a row straight up and down like stacked up on top of one another. could see that the lights belonged to something dark. lights seemed to flicker top light would shine very bright middle lights would dim etc. lights would sort of move a bit to where the shape looked like a cross. then the top light would go completely out or maybe it shone light different direction anyways when this happened i could see that the top object was a triangle shaped aircraft hovering above the rest. charcoal grey in color, it was very obvious that this was separate from the rest as it seemed to be hovering above them. then that object would shine bright again. my wife daughter and i all looked thru the scope and continued watching it over the course of an hour. although it didn't appear to be moving by the end of two hours it was farther into the northeast hemisphere than originally detected. seemed to stay in a straight up and down figure but would sort of come together to appear as one light. was very obvious. the light as it continued to slowly move northwards the light became harder and harder to detect. i seemed to notice that it appeared the object was

daylight, half 6, on a cloudy, blustery evening. on a country lane, 15 miles south of oxford, i saw a car stopped by the side of the road and the driver out of the car holding an ipad up photographing the sky low down to the north east.\r\ni looked over and saw a huge metallic disc; a classic ufo shape, was visible in a gap in the total cloud cover. i slowed the car but didn't brake hard as i had a speed merchant on my bumper. i observed the disc for approx 15 to 20 seconds until a line of trees obscured my view.\r\nthe disc was approx 20% obscured by cloud which made it easier to estimate its distance and size. this disc was approx 500 metres in diameter - half a kilometre! it was at least this large!\r\nit was shiny, metallic and with a raised edge. the edge was alternate silver and black panels.\r\napart from its size, the most surprising fact was it being so stationary; as the clouds rolled on it was completely static. it was also tilted over at around 15 degrees. it was not a balloon or airship, and anyway the weather wasn't suitable for such things.\r\ni drove on till i'd passed the trees and stopped around a corner about 400 m further on to get a better view and get the car behind past me. the cloud cover had closed up. i waited and saw no more then it started to rain. oddly i didn't return to see the person with the ipad. i assumed it would be all over the local news the next day.\r\ni am a 58 year old engineer that estimates sizes and distances for a living, i know what i saw was not anything normal - and it was massive. i went home, my wife and family found it all very amusing. everyone i know has heard my tale, they laugh too and no-one believes me. why are so many people so short-sighted and unable to believe?\r\nthe person with the ipad remains a mystery, i scanned the local papers and internet for anything, but nothing! i haven't stopped kicking myself since for not going back to see ipad man and get his pictures.\r\ndays later i happened to drive under the location about 2 miles to the north, where i estimated the ufo to be and wondered what there was to see. there i saw a large solar farm (i'd forgotten about it as it's not so visible form the road). i believe the ufo was hovering over this and looking down on it. why else would it be tilted over?\r\nthe size, the solid metallic shape and it's edge features were all real. it's odd tilt, partly obscured by cloud and its completely stationary position on such a stormy evening all contributed to it being the firm ufo sighting of my lifetime.\r\ni have not stopped berating myself since for not returning to the other witness for his photographic proof. why didn't he go public with his photos?","distance":"Over One
