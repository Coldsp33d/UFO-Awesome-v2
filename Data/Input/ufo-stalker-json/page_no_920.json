pa\r\nwe spoke on the phone nov 15 2014.\r\n\r\non nov 14 2014 i was on live radio presenting my encounter with peter davenport of the nationa ufo reporting center on the jeff remse program. \r\n\r\ni would like my information passed to john ventre and if possible, considered for submission on \"hanger 1\" tv series, and or featured on the mufon website.\r\n\r\nbelow is my submission with some editing changes.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nufo june 25 1965 philadelphia pa - mufom case # 61370\r\n\r\n\r\nthe ufo report i am making took place in philadelphia pa on june 25, 1965.\r\nat the time i was eleven years old. i am a retired air force intelligence officer (major), and veteran of the gulf war. \r\n\r\ni was sitting looking out a window when i saw a large bright object descending at a fast rate of speed. it was coming down at a 45% angle at perhaps fifty miles per hour. i thought it was a rocket, because of its shape, a cylinder with rounded ends. i ran and hid behind the couch away from the window. i expected an explosion but heard nothing, so i looked out. i saw the ufo hovering a block down the street over roof tops.\r\n\r\nthe ufo had descended at 22nd street, descending at the intersection of 22nd and mount vernon street, moving north then stopping at 22nd and wallace street. i was viewing the object from my grandmother and grandfather's 3rd floor apartment window at [address moved to fi section/cms/tg]], philadelphia pa on june 25th 1968.\r\nthe ufo followed the outline of all the homes and buildings-opposite my side of the street, including a church. it flew just feet above the roof tops.\r\n\r\nit would pause, descend, and rise, hovering about ten feet above all the roof tops. it was as if it was viewing inside the homes. it moved slowly traveling at walking pace.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was the length of a city bus, with rounded ends, but wider in circumference. it was a large cylinder, it had no markings of any kind, no wings, no visible engines, no windows. the entire surface was made up of a plasma field, like a close up image of the sun. these gases or ions spun and disappeared under the surface, diving and rising like a gas. the brightness was intense. it was composed of several colors, white, yellow and orange. it reminded me of someone mixing giant cans of paint. it was very beautiful but hard on the eyes because of its brilliance. \r\nat this point in my life i think what i saw then was a fusion powered ship. i'm also glad it did not damage my eyesight. they sky was clear, it was a hot summer's day.\r\n\r\nat one point i turned around looking behind me into the apartment and noticed the patterns of light also produced shadows on my grandmothers walls. the patterns it produced on the walls were dark with light edges. the patterns matched the moving patterns of the vessel's surface. the only thing i've ever seen similar are close up films of the sun. in addition to the swirling patterns of light i noticed it was layered in a raised dimple pattern that covered it's entire surface. the dimples appeared to vibrate but stayed in place like those on a basketball while plumes of gas rose and fell like filaments of a magnet. this was truly amazing to see! at times i used my hands to shield my eyes. it was the brightest light i've ever seen and today i'm sixty years old, as of november 2014. i was alone viewing the object. my grandfather was at work and my grandmother went downstairs to another apartment for a short time.\r\n\r\nit approached my location stopping directly in front of me. i was in the third floor apartment. i did not feel any heat. at this point it was about 80 feet away, close enough to throw a ball to it! i was able to observe this object for perhaps five minutes in total, which seemed then to be a long time. as i said it paused several times over apartments, then would move and stop again several times. it flew over the bell tower of the olivet covenant presbyterian church (current name) at 22nd and wallace streets, just across from my location. \r\n\r\njust before the ufo changed direction (descending, or rising, stopping or starting to move forward) it emitted a loud sound. the sound always preceded its change in movement by about two seconds each time. so i knew when it was going to move again. the sound reminded me of a loud hiss from an old steam train. i'm not saying there was steam just that the sound was similar to that or when a large truck makes releasing air brakes. it was strange hearing an anachronistic sound and seeing an advanced flying vehicle! \r\n\r\nonce the ufo got to the last building at the intersection of 22nd and fairmont streets it angled at 45 degrees, with its front end pointing up, it rose about fifty feet.\r\ni ran to another window on the side facing wallace street, so was able to watch it again. it leveled off, then flew over the walls of the eastern state penitentiary, \r\n(this spooky relic is now open to the public for tours) it picked up speed at about 35 miles per hour flying north. it continued flying north at a level constant speed until i lost view of it. this craft was definitely controlled by some form of intelligence. it was not a blimp, i had seen these vessels before for the philadelphia army navy games traditionally held in philadelphia in those years.\r\n\r\nwhen my grandmother came in i told her what i had witnessed. we were both very religious, she had difficulty believing my story and asked me to swear by placing my hand on the bible, which i did. she was convinced and saddened that she had missed this wonderful sight by just minutes.\r\n\r\nthat evening or perhaps the next night we watched a tv program that highlighted the vessel i had seen and their close encounter with it. the program was \"the arthur godfrey show\", or one of his \"specials\". arthur godfrey was a respected pilot, and was a colonel in the air force reserve. arthur godfrey and frank munciello another experienced pilot were flying in a small aircraft from new york to the washington dc area. their flight path took them over or near philadelphia on the same day of my encounter. live on national tv author godfrey described that a brilliantly lit vessel followed and maneuvered around his aircraft. he said it matched his course and speed. he admitted he was scared of the vessel's close maneuvers until it finally veered off. arthur godfrey was a well know tv producer and tv host.  his tv program was viewed by millions of americans. my grandparents and i knew he was describing the same vessel i had seen. an account of arthur godfrey's story can be read on ufodocarchiv.Org. in 1993 i happened across a book, \"the ufo encyclopedia\" by john spencer. on page 129 i read the account by arthur godfrey validating my sighting. \r\n\r\nlater accounts of arthur godfrey's story have been muddied. some report the incident online as 1964, 1965 and 1966, some report it was during the evening, or say he was reporting an event he witnessed years earlier. the actual date he saw the vessel was june 25 1965, then he reported it in the evening. he was not in both places at the same time. as i viewed his broadcast myself, i was stunned at his anger and asking for an explanation as to what had happened. he was mad because this event had just happened, and was not years prior as some recent reports are now saying. i hope someone can track down a recording of that broadcast.\r\n\r\ni can recall to this day my grandparents discussing me and what to do about the sighting. my grandmother wanted to call mr arthur godfrey who had just reported the sighting on national tv. my grandfather opposed it saying i would be tagged as the flying saucer boy or some other bad thing that would only cause me harm. i remember my grandmother wanting to talk to someone at the franklin institute planetarium in philadelphia. she wanted to know if others had reported seeing the vessel. i stayed several weeks with my grandparents, finally they told me not to mention it to anyone\r\n\r\nyears later as an intelligence officer i often gave my air force squadron current intelligence briefings. i was an intelligence officer in the 732nd military airlift squadron at mcguire air force base in new jersey, i served in this position for approximately ten years, including during the gulf war. during one briefing an aircrew explained to me they encountered a ball lightening encounter, also called saint elmo's fire. a sphere of charged particles entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet. the aircraft was a c-141 starlifter. the sphere about three feet in diameter entered the cockpit then floated inside the aircraft to the cargo bay where it hovered for a time then vanished. \r\n\r\nthe entire crew witnesses the sphere and actually enjoyed the event. they asked if i knew of any ufo sightings. i then told them my story. this upset my squadron training officer who verbally reprimanded me, i was ordered to never speak about ufo's again. i eventually retired from the military as a major in 1997.","distance":"21-100

approximately 18:00 hours and already very dark. we were returning home from pidgeon forge, tennessee. we had travelled all day trying to return home before it got too late. we had just passed through pine grove, la on la hwy 16 had just turned onto la hwy 63. \r\n\r\nbefore we had made it to the driveway of the (now closed down) “u.S. coast guard grangeville loran c facility”, my father-in-law pointed out that there were lights passing over the road. i looked upward ahead of us and there were relatively dim lights were travelling just barely above the tree tops. \r\n\r\nthe lights were so dim that they caused very little if any reflected glow on the crafts surface around it. we could not make out anything about the shape of the craft. even our vehicle headlights did not put enough light to make out anything about the craft other than the lights. \r\n\r\nthe lights were in a linear placement along the craft and they were very close to the tree tops. so, the would be on the bottom of the craft. the lights were few, but we were able to see them as they crossed the road. \r\n\r\nafter the first lights reached the west side of the road, i started watching the lights that were at the edge of the east side of the road the eastern most lights crossed the road completely before the last of the lights came into view on the eastern side. \r\n\r\nthe craft was at least twice as long as the distance from the tree tops on one side of the road to the tree tops on the other side of the road. because of this, i am guessing that the craft must be at least 50’ – 70’ in length.  it could be longer, but i could only use the lights as i could not make anything out about the craft but the lights.\r\n\r\nthe craft was travelling slowly. i would compare it to about the speed of someone walking fast. by the way that it moved slowly but steady, it reminded me of a blimp or a dirigible.\r\n\r\nthe craft passed just south of the “u.S. coast guard grangeville loran c facility” driveway, so i am suspecting that it was one of our crafts that is being tested and is using the loran facility as a base or a stopover area. i looked up the facility on google maps and converted over to the satellite image and noticed there are a couple of areas that would provide a clearing large enough to set down the craft and still have enough clearing around it for some maneuvering space.\r\n\r\nthis area is definitely rural. the area closely around the sighting is wooded. the amite river is nearby and has several sand and gravel pits around it. there is a commercial dairy farm nearby and a few other land owners in the area who also raise some cattle. \r\n\r\npersonally, i feel that this was some sort of government craft especially with it travelling somewhat in the direction of a \"closed\" u.S. coast guard facility.\r\n\r\nour windows were up on our vehicle, but we heard no noise other than what our vehicle made. \r\n","distance":"101-500

spotted two, low flying objects in the sky, they are the size of an aircraft its dark but it looks like they are the shape of an aircraft or like a jet also, with bright flashing lights that are not the same as a helicopter or an airplane, they dont have the red, blue lights like the impd helicopters either, they fly very slowly,almost hovering, and they seem to be circling the same large area of indianapolis one night we followed one as it was in front of us and very low, lower than a typical plane with no sound as we followed it very slowly, it hovered, then changed direction. we have only seen two, and its every night, emerson/binford area, and we see one farther west circling another area very slowly. the other night while at the 465 shadeland exit on the highway, i could see them from a distance , i notice the slow movement and the large lights. i've mentioned this to my mother who said she has watched them from her house out in avon, she mentioned them hoovering and she believes they are some type of drone. i believe the possibility they could be drones, but they are too large to be an amateurs drone, especially since they are in the same areas every night it looks like they are patrolling. i tried googling this for indianapolis/indiana and have found nothing, especially on the news i know others have had to see them, my boyfriend has been with me while i saw it also, we have seen them for the past couple weeks which makes me think the possibility of drones, but they are huge!. i consider myself an  space enthusiast lol. always looking up at the sky & stars, i know what looks like what in the sky especially at night and the first night i saw these it was exciting and scary as i actually thought it could be a ufo until i thought about drones. i'm just wondering if anyone else has seen them, i didnt have my phone on me at the time so im hoping someone can come forward with photo evidence until next time im right under them

exact same direction as the 3 spheres were traveling, directly towards nellis afb about 10 miles ahead. they were directly above me as i caught site of them @ about 300'-400'. they were traveling approximately 300-400 mph. they were in a sideways triangular formation with the bottom @ my 9:00 o'clock. they continued their ne direction of travel until i lost site of them, about 8-10 seconds when they became to small to observe any further. several seconds before losing site, the spherical object @ my 3:00 o'clock moved at a steady rate between the other 2 to my 9:00 o'clock then made several rapid position changes with respect to the other 2 unlike any bird or plane would do. \r\n  i was raised in oxnard california near point magu naval air station and the ocean. i've seen all types of aircraft and avian and know most by profile and name. i was sworn into the army for 2 hours when i was 18 years old, but my spina bifida got me discharged within those 2 hours. nevertheless i was scheduled to attend their longest schooling in computers and electronics to keep missile systems operational. all this on my venture to become a fighter pilot, my dream, but the medical discharge killed that. anyways i tell this because i know what i'm looking at in the sky. this was my first sighting after 51 years of watching the skies. \r\n  just prior to this sighting i seen a c-130 hercules (8,000') headed northeast and an airliner traveling east and what looked like a cessna 172 headed west. the time of citing was very close to 2:05 pm and lasted 8-10 seconds. they appeared whitish-metallic and i could see the sun reflecting off their 10:00 o'clock surfaces. they were obviously drones under intelligent control and moved by some form of gravity drive. they made no sound and clearly to small to be piloted by ebe's.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:09","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

made it look like the moon was talking to me. but there was no sign of it in pics. but then one pic i had captured had a red oval object. it was not seen through the naked eye. i then captured a video, and the object kept moving and blinking in the video. i went down and explained the phenomeon to frinds and family and along with my sis and friend we went to check if it was still there. it was. i was the only one able to see it in my cam, while my sis and friend could not due to their phone zooming strength being limited to 2x while mine was 4x zoom.\r\n\r\nall of us saw the image blinking. i tried moving the cam tothe left and right to make sure it was not the camera fault, but the object was still in the same spot at every direction when i reduced the zoom the object could be seen very lightly. we took three videos. at different times with a break of 5 mins in between each interval. it was seen around 07:23pm to 08:13pm ist. in between it stopped during a cloud cover and after the time we saw it we went down and tried to cintact people to get videos of the moon. when we up again there was a cloud cover and hence could not see it thre after.\r\n\r\nwhen i first noticed the object i though the moon was talking to me. for the shape of the object blinking looked like it was really talking. it was scarry and i thought i was seeing things. there was a powercut in the

approximately 150 houses on my route so my father would normally take me on my route.  but it was volley ball season and my father taught math, history, and coached volleyball at a local high school, so during volley ball season he usually got home too late to take me on the route so my mother had to take me.  she hated taking my the route b/c my father had just bought her a brand new buick limited and she didn't want me throwing papers from her new car. i paid my older sister to fold and rubber band the papers for me and when my mother took me on the route my sister had to throw the left side and i threw the right side.  anyone with a paper route knows its really difficult to throw papers with a new driver b/c they don't know which houses to slow down for.  i was 13 and my sister was 14 at the time. my mother tried to wait for my father to come home to take me but it was pushing 6 pm and the customers complain if they get their papers after dark.  we loaded up the buick and started the route.  about 1/2 mile from our home we turned onto warner ave from utah st and that was the start of my route.  my mother was driving way too fast and when my sister and i threw the paper it would sail into the yard of the house down from the intended house b/c we were going too fast.  that meant i often had to tell my mother to stop the car and i would have to get out and put the paper in the correct yard.  i stopped my mother for the second time b/c we missed more houses and grabbed 5 newspapers and exited the buick to walk to the houses and put the papers in the yard.  right before i got out of the car my mothers radio went to static.  i threw the five houses on foot and was walking back to the car when i noticed everyone on the street starting to come outside.  they were asking each other who had power, apparently power for that entire street had went off.  then about 10 houses down from the yard i was walking through i noticed two elderly women pointing up in the sky at something.  i looked briefly at what they were pointing at and i just dismissed what i say as a low goodyear blimp flying with the advertisement lights on the side.  the goodyear blimp was a common site in jackson during that time. i climbed through the window of the backseat to get into the car b/c if i opened the door all the papers would fall out of the car.  but my mothers car had shut off and would not crank back up. i got back out of the car and told her to pop the hood so i could check the battery cable connection.  thats when i noticed every single car on the street that was running had stalled.  there were now more neighbors outside pointing up at the objects and i looked again and it was not about 100 ft away from us heading toward us and only about 100 ft above the ground, and instead of it being one large blimp like i originally thought i could now see that there were 3 separate objects on behind the other about 50 ft apart in a single line moving very slowly down warner ave.  the first one was shaped like a pentagon and was gun metal black and had blue lights around its perimeter with a pulsating red light in the middle.  this object was so close i could not see the top of it, it shined a very bright intense white light on one of the houses and then walked the light down towards our car, like a police helicopter does...But it was totally silent.  this thing was so close to me i could have it it with a tennis ball.  the one behind it was also shaped like a trapezoid and i could see the second \"story\" or layer of this craft and there was a white section that looked like windows and i could see beings moving through this section.  it had orange and green lights on its perimeter but i don't remember if it had a pulsating red center light like the first one.  the first one was so close to me i could see patterns in fixtures in its underbelly.  the second one did not shine a light down like the first one did until it passed over our car and was a good 100 yrds away.  the second object appeared to be jet black.  the third object was shaped  more like a diamond and it had blue and green and white lights and this object was actually \"tumbling\" slowly or rotating slowly on its horizontal axis. it was seemed to have a jet black surface as opposed to gun metal like the first one.  behind the third object was a small red ball of light moving along with the 3 objects.  it took me a couple of minutes before i realized that these objects were not some kind of quiet airplane or some kind of new blimp with a new shape.  these 3 objects were in no hurry whatsoever and almost seemed to be \"parading\" for us.  they went about two thirds of the way down warner ave and then began a very slow ascent up and to the right in the direction of the full moon.  once the objects were approximately a mile or two away all the power came back on on the street and my mothers cars headlights came back on and she restarted the car.  these objects were in view for 20 to 30 minutes and in no hurry whatsoever.  i saw them, my mother saw them and my sister saw them and several residents on warner ave saw them.  this event changed my life, and quite honestly not for the better.  this event totally disrupted my then held belief system of who we are as beings.  my sister is now 50 and is respected church member and a nurse in clinton, ms and my mother is a retired school teacher and is now 78.  i talked about it once more with my mother when i was a freshman in college and never since then. my sister and i never discussed it again.  i've waited all these years to say anything because i just know no one would believe me.  close encounters of the 3rd kind came out the following year and my brother, who was studying engineering at the univ of tenn took me to see it.  he had already seen it but wanted me to see it b/c of what i saw the year before.  the three objects in that movie during the police chase is almost exactly what we saw, except in speilbergs movie the craft were more round as opposed having an angular configuration like what we saw.  this is one incident in my life but as i read transformation and as i listened to travis walton i realized that this incident fits a larger narrative of some things that have occurred in my life. i have waited so long to come forward because i know no one will believe me.  i've had trouble with alcohol and holding a job even though i have an engineering degree and all my life i've just been kinda unstable.  so i know no one will believe me, i wouldn't believe me.  as a matter of fact i don't believe 95% of ufologists, abductees, and so called experts out there in this field. i've believe maybe 2 abductee stories i've heard.  i have always felt completely alone with this.  im unstable so do i go public and possibly jeopardize my mothers and my sisters reputation? i am the black sheep of the family, the only one in my family to ever be arrested so why go public?  this is why, i am telling the truth and i will take any lie detector test administered by anyone.  i also wanted to go public before my mother passed and/or before she starts to lose her memory.  i have nothing really to lose by telling my story here b/c i think there are more guys like me (like the drunk pilot in independence day no one believed) than there are guys with squeaky clean resume's that talk about these events.  and what i've divulged here is just part of a larger narrative.  those who have experienced what i have know exactly what i'm talking about, its as if we know something, some truth, about the universe that no one else really knows and will believe anytime soon.  so what do you do with that?  well i am giving this information to mufon and this is just the tip of the iceberg.  lets just see what happens from here.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

cigar-shaped craft) from the same location -- i keep my eyes open. this was a night sighting, from the windows of our two-story house. i took notice of this object out my bedroom window as it seemed big, but was moving far too slowly to be a jet aircraft -- and was far too big, easily 3-4 times larger than the typical outline of jet aircraft navigation lights. i called my boys, aged 7 and 9, to view this and we all ran to watch from another window as the object moved slowly behind a tall pine tree (about 100' tall on one corner of the property). the object was heading southeast, then changed direction in a slow curve to due east, lazily moving right past my house less than a half-mile away. it moved right over the main part of town, banked slowly south for approx. 1/8th of a mile, then back on a due east course, heading toward berkeley across san francisco bay. we then lost sight of it through the trees, as it was quite low (no more than 1000 feet). it was then that my wife got home from work and said that she'd seen the object as well from her car, thinking it looked big, and had rather odd lights for an airliner. she also remarked that it made no noise whatsoever, while jets flying past are often quite loud. my boys then said that that was the object they'd seen before in the general vicinity.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

(this felt different than my common episodes of sleep paralysis as i felt very aware and calm). my eye caught a light that was zig-zagging around way out in the distance. it resembled a star. i recognized it as a ufo right away and became fixated on the object. within a couple seconds the object zoomed in right above the tree line outside my window and slowed down to a hover. there were no lights coming from it now. it was a dark black/grey saucer. i was in complete awe. i thought \"oh my god. this is insane.\" but i was not scared. it was quite beautiful. i felt very open and wanted to understand. just as it was hovering, i had this intense feeling of being 'lifted' or expelled from my position. it was beyond anything i can explain. the intense feeling escalated and suddenly i 'awoke' to a loud slam from what sounded like it came from inside my head. i was laying on my right side this time facing the door (away from the window). i didn't see it leave. the whole experience felt like i had almost 'reeled it in'. it oddly felt arranged. the only other experience i've had was back when i was about 10. i saw a golden ufo in the countryside with small orbs circling it. however, my latest experience has left me feeling very anxious and sick to my stomach all day. was this abduction? a weird dream? i can't recall anything between that intense feeling and then coming out of it. the whole experience probably lasted about 10 seconds, but it felt longer than that.

park at the rear . whist we were all chatting and walking into the car park my sister made a comment about what a strange looking plane that was. we all looked up ahead and across the main one way street in the town centre were fixed green and red lights which looked to be heading towards us. \r\ni knew it wasn't a plane as worked at the airport for years and these lights were not a commercial plane. we all stood trying to work out what is was but in my mind i could only think it must be a helicopter but even still, something seemed odd with the lights illumination and the fact there was no noise. although we thought it was heading towards us and were expecting it to come pass overhead, i suddenly realised it was just hoovering still in mid air just above and set back behind some 3 story flats just off the main one way road. it was a dark night with low clouds (no visible stars) and hazy which you could see from the red and green lights . at this point we were all starting to realise something was just wrong with what we thought it should or could be and were questioning what the hell it was. i started to walk closer to see if i could try see the shape of the silhouette the lights were attached to but within moments the object suddenly accelerated from its stationary position, seamlessly and silently changing direction and now moving along the same direction of the the one street and disappeared out of view behind the buildings located on this street. \r\n\r\ni called 999 not for assistance but to see if any other reports had been made they explained what we had seen but they were only able to transfer my call either to emergency services or ambulance and as had now disappeared, i decided not to bother the police as doubted they could do little about it anyway.
