2014 at 5:45 pm while departing our house to dine with another couple we spotted approx. 9 ivory/white lights in an up-side down \"v\" formation. our car was next to our house and the front was positioned directly toward the lights, our 12 o'clock and 30 degrees vertically from the horizon. the number of lights and the perfect formation immediately caught our attention as they were moving slowly towards us (northern direction). my wife was closing the front door of our house and i commented to her in a normal speaking tone,\"what in the h-- is that?\"\r\ninitially we thought they were helicopters heading for queen city airport two miles from us. the field has two paved runways and is\r\nhome for many light aircraft and several  business jets. sometimes an army chinook helicopter lands there briefly.\r\nwe walked across our street into a dead end street which is perpendicular to our street to avoid a street lamp and by then the lights stopped movement.\r\n the formation consisted of three lights on the left leg, one light on the point and five lights on the right leg. all were circular and bright white/red with somewhat blurry edges. my wife remembers them initially as being red however i saw them as she was closing our front door. it appeared they were ivory/white and after a minute or two i could see red in the mid section much like the equator is on earth but not a distinct border on the lights. the wide blurry red mid section (at least one third of the dia. of each light) on each was moving, either blinking very slowly or perhaps rotating.  \r\nthey appeared to be very slightly flickering with blurry edges but that might've been due to the  atmospheric conditions.\r\ni'd estimate the brightness was that of a car's headlight from two miles away. altitude was unknown and we estimated their location  as above the eastern area of emmaus, pa. and several miles from us. they were brighter than any star but were smaller than the size \r\nof venus on a mostly clear night.\r\nthere was not any sound heard during any time of this sighting.\r\nthe sky in our area was mostly clear with a number of  clouds which were formed in a horizontal position. i did not see any moon and few stars were seen. we live near many new car dealers which have many lights in their lots and a small shopping center is directly across the street from the car dealers.\r\nshortly after stopping the three lights on the left leg began a vertical movement  one above the other and faded becoming entirely red in color. they might have went into a cloud but i could not see (any cloud) at that distance. after the three faded away we heard and saw a one engine light aircraft  to our right coming out of the east and heading in a westerly direction on an intersecting course with the lights. our ground lights made it possible for me to see the aircraft which appeared white with a light trim color. possibly yellow. i'd estimate the aircraft's altitude was approx. 2,000 ft. at the same time three very bright white lights appeared behind and below much farther out (south) from the right leg of the formation. they appeared to be moving in a northerly direction to catch up with the lights that were stationary. they could've been the three lights that were in the left leg that climbed and faded away and were returning. these lights were now appearing much brighter and were similiar to an aircraft landing light. the three lights were lined up abreast of each other \r\nmeanwhile each light in the right leg of the initial formation took turns becoming brighter and a large white light appeared on the lights but not at the same time. no distinct pattern was seen. the two leading lights in the right leg came closer together almost touching and their color was definately bright red. \r\nthe light aircraft was now very close to the unidentified lights and crossed in front of them. by then we could not hear the engine sound of the light aircraft.\r\nthe five lights remained stationary, somehow one light had disappeared leaving five lights, as we entered our car and drove  in a southernly direction to meet our friends who were about three miles from our house. a norfolk southern freight train passed us 150 ft. to our left (lehigh line to reading and harrisburg). the track elevation rises as the line enters emmaus,pa. \r\nafter stopping for a series of signal lights, i saw four lights appear just above but way out from the train. this would be in my 10 o'clock position. they were closer or larger than before. while noticing they were yellow, i observed three additional lights appearing to their right (my left). these were larger and brighter with a deeper amber color and they were separated from the four yellow lights. i'd estimate their size as an aspirin held at my arms length, larger than the other lights. i strongly believe all these lights were the same that we saw at our house. our location at that time was about one mile plus from our house (in a straight line southernly in direction).\r\n i'm a military veteran and the three amber lights resembled flares but no smoke emitting from them and they were stationary.\r\nour road dropped in elevation and between that and the moving freight train we could no longer see the lights. the time was about\r\n6: 10 pm.\r\ni am retired and have excellent eye sight with glasses mainly used for reading but i was wearing them during this entire event. i have been  a lifetime aviation enthusiast. the lights were definately not any type of aircraft or flares . \r\nthe following day i stopped at the queen city airport and they indicated they had not heard about the sighting  and mentioned the airport closes around 6 pm. however the light aircraft we saw which i believe was a cessna could probably still land there as the field has night landing lights.\r\nlehigh valley airport (abe) a medium size airport for airliners is about 8 to 10 miles northeast from our house and i'm sure they would've warned that light aircraft about the light objects if in fact\r\nthey appeared on their radar. we were very surprised the light aircraft headed directly towards the lights and came very close.\r\nwell over 100,000 people live in this very spread out area  which includes allentown, emmaus, bethlehem and other small towns.\r\npa. rt. 309 joins with interstate 78 and both are very heavily traveled plus it was friday night at rush hour. the lights had to be seen by many people.\r\n our thoughts during the sighting which still continues is this was a significant event. we have been to many air shows and aviation events over a period of many years. my wife told me that after the event she knew the lights had to be unidentified objects.\r\nthe light aircraft should not be too difficult to track down.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path

movie with a ufo. we got into a conversation about it and she asked me if i had ever seen a ufo. i proceeded to tell her the same story that i'm about to tell you that i had never told anybody because to be quite honest... as i was telling her the story,memories were coming to me that i had completely put in the back of my mind. in 1995 i lived in a small town called dover missouri, it's a very small town about 60 miles east from kansas city. i was living with a girlfriend at the time and her brother.My girlfriend worked the night shift so i would stay up late at night and wait for her to get home in the morning. for some reason we decided to go to concordia missouri to a truck stop for coffee. the truck stop was about 25 to 30 miles away from where we were. my girlfriend's brother was driving his car and i was riding in the passenger seat. we left the house about 1230 or 1 o'clock in the morning, and proceeded to drive east on highway 24 leaving dover towards the exit to go to concordia. my girlfriend's brother had some god awful rap music playing in the car and i was looking out the window watching for deer. as i am looking out the window he is talking but i'm really not paying attention to what he is saying because i see a bright light about a mile ahead 200 feet off the ground ahead of us.I was able to gauge the distance because i could see beyond the water tower that i was familiar with at an orchard on 24 highway. i could clearly make out the red light was flashing on top of the water tower, and this light appeared to be just off to the side of it and above it. i watched the light for about a minute or two and i asked him if he saw what i saw. i can only describe it as a ball of light that changed colors. as we got closer i noticed that it was not moving it was stationary side by side with the light on top of the water tower. keep in mind this water tower is in the middle of nowhere there are no buildings around for at least 15 to 20 miles besides the barn that was on the opposite side of the road and is about half the height of the water tower. i remember telling him its not moving its not moving, we stop the car to get out and look at it and it started to move. this is the point of the story where my fiance asked me what happened next... and to be honest until she asked me that question i never thought about it, and i do not remember what happened next. my next memory is turning south onto the side road off of 24. and i'm not sure but i believe that it was much later when we arrived at the truck stop around 3 a.M. but it seemed perfectly normal to us at the time and remained that way until the night i was with my fiance 19 years later. as i have thought about it more the last month or so i remember flashes of images but i do not trust the images are accurate because as i said, im not sure what happened.","distance":"101-500

business and vacation and who often visited me. he is an engineer who has worked for the max planck institute and motorola among other places. he has had a very interesting paranormal experience regarding duplicating the experiment of a max planck colleague in which strange voices ended up on recording tape deliberately recored but with the record level off. he did what his colleague did and got the same result. \r\n\r\n(2) and i have seen ufos all my life. i have had what i consider to be a paranormal experience too.    a - at age 15 or so, in winchester, mass., circa 1960-61, i reported a sighting of two silver disks traveling side by side at the height of a b-52 but zipping down the sky extremely fast while simultaneously vibrating in a  minuscule zig-zagway. b-52s in those days crawled down the sky, in comparison. i at that time collected bubble gum \"airplane cards,\" built model planes, had an avid interest in astronomy and ufos and read about all of these. the reporter i wrote to was george fawcett and the newspaper he had a column in was the woburn times in massachusetts. i lived in winchester, the adjacent town. he wrote an article that mentioned me and other peoples in nearby towns. we had all seen the same thing.    b - circa 1964 in cambridge, mas.I saw a blue-green fireball streak rapidly in a straight low in the sky in broad daylight and vanish over the horizon.    c - circa 2006 i had an amazing close encounter with an orange-red-yellow-complected (like the complexion of the sun), pulsatingcircular disk--not an orb--sort of in the shape of a cd suspended in the sky. it was huge and right before me. i was in winchester on a street high above the rest of the town with a view overlooking a valley and walking to my car. while i saw it i \"heard\" (but knew it was in my mind, not via ears) a low pulsating vibration seemingly well under 20 hz and the type you feel, although i did not feel it. no sooner did i see it and simultaneously wonder \"what the hell is that?\" it shot sideways without changing altitude at the kind of  \"warp speed\" depicted in star trek and streaked-vanished behind me the house adjacent the house i was near.      d - as an observer of the skies i have observed round white lights behaving unusually from time to time in various states and countries.    e- i have had a few paranormal or spiritual events, very realistic and personally meaningful, from childhood through young adulthood, and circa age 14 i had some repeat-scenario, scary dreams of squadrons of delta-shaped ufos with round porthole windows and orange light inside flying silently over my family's back yard in the middle of the night as the neighborhood was asleep--long before i ever knew or imagined that there were ufos of this shape. \r\n\r\nall of this background is to show that my friend and i had been predisposed via prior paranormal experiences to being able to discuss them and \"believe\" in them. maybe, by being together, the apparatus for seeing them is enhanced.\r\n\r\nthe \"experience\" in vermont\r\n\r\nmy friend was here in winchester, mass., sometime in the 1990s, let's just say 1992 (which i base on knowing the approximate date of purchase the orange leather jacket i had just bought, which is in our photo on the day of the \"experience.\") and we decided to take a trip to vermont to see the foliage, so it was probably late september. we stopped and got out of the car at one of those 'scenic view' areas. there was a long wooden pier nearby. we walked down it to the end and asked someone there there to take my friend's camera and take our picture with our backs to the lake. and that was it! we did not see any ufos. we were not aware of any ufos. we had not been discussing ufos. my friend concluded his trip and returned to germany.\r\n\r\n\"photographic evidence\"\r\n\r\nmy friend has the film developed from our day in vermont and sent me the photo of us on the wooden pier at the lake. it was nothing special, just a souvenir. a few years later i looked at it again and saw some small, pale-white, well-defined streaks in the cloudless sky and e-mailed my friend and wondered if they could be ufos. they were  definitely 'something' and 'not nothing.' he remarked when he replied that he saw them too in his copy. we didn't give it much more thought.\r\n\r\nthis year i have beeb going through boxes of slides, negatives, and old photos. i cane across the photo of my friend and me and had a brainstorm: scan it at high resolution and then blow it up to see what those two streaks might be. i did. they are both  definitely 'something' and 'not nothing'--on steroids, as the saying goes! one of them has so much detail kt is astounding, and yet while the detail is like nothing i have seen before in a ufo picture--looking physical, concrete and durable, constructed, of different and distinct colors as opposed to colored lights, and all kinds of detail i do not understand, such as a \"shadow\" that is not shadow-like but solid black (but how can there be a shadow mid-air?). it mimics what is above it rather than be a real shadow of it, as i view it.\r\n\r\n\"conclusion?\"\r\n\r\ni certainly don't know other than tell you as best i can about the history of what i discovered and think may be some unique photographic evidence of something or other. as i say, it is surely 'something' and 'not nothing.' both my friend and i see these marks in our photos. \r\n\r\ni am sending this to you today to ask what i should do. i am 68 now and in good health, but if i have a rare and valuable photo that the world ought to have access to, i want to take steps to get it out there as soon as possible. first,i would like to see what you have to say, if you are interested, or who you might recommend to \"curate\" the photo, and of course there are proprietary and legal concerns. some stranger took the photo on bruno's camera and film and i have a copy. it seems that my friend is the proprietor and owns the rights to the photo.\r\n\r\nbut the photo is amazing! i am hoping it is what i hope it is. i have considered it could be some photo-lab anomaly, but based on the complexity of the image i rule that out. a professional analysis is in order.\r\n\r\nplease contact me to discuss the photo. i want someone to come here to see it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":61495,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.5603028,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11172014-0011","longitude":-72.57277149999999,"occurred":715293000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Vermont","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1416283589000,"summary":"I
