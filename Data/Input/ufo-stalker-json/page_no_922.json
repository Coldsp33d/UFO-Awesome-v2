then the one that moved would also do the same with the top largest one. there is always a cloud cover mist after watching them for more than 5 min, covers the 2 on the right both times. no other clouds visible in the sky! the one on left bottom seems to be a look out, or a guard to the others since it doesn't do anything except change shape from sparkly to boomerang shape, red flashes on a constant basis. looking like a shooting star both times in movement is clever, when it comes to a stop it doesn't disappear, it is just as bright. picture the formation as a house connect the dots, one on the base, straight up vertical one at roofline, diagonal to the one at the peek, diagonal back down to one at roofline, straight down to one at base. i can see in distance smaller sparkly formations, but they do disappear. my son witnessed the first sighting with me in oct. i have seen them here in maine growing up. come to think it, they have always been in the same general south west location! i'm glad they are watching, tracking our world chaos. for some reason looking and watching has always brought tears to my eyes, not crying, just watering up of my eyes, no sadness, if i don't wipe them away they stream down my cheeks. i noticed my son wiping his eyes too! i had thought it was just my own reaction but apparently not.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":61444,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.905101056466435,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11162014-0008","longitude":-69.80575069030925,"occurred":1416138600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1416142821000,"summary":"I've seen them before in oct, around 6 am eastern time, always 5. maybe more farther distance.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"04530","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Bath, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:82792"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Santa Rosa","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At appx 10:00pm on nov 15, 2014, i was walking my dog around the block from my residence. i was on franquette st heading south and then turned on to a path that connects me to martha way along the field behind my home, east. i turned onto the path, passed a large redwood tree growing on the front of the property along franquette st. and then a red light or glow in the sky caught my eye and i saw the ufo or craft ascending into the sky from about a 73 degree angle in the ne sky while heading sw towards me. it ascended up over my head and passed into the sw sky. i turned completely around and watched while it ascended into the cloud cover above, until it disappeared. at first it appeared about the size of a penny and just before it disappeared i'd say it was the size of an aspirin. when i first laid eyes on it, i thought it was maybe a child's toy drone or maybe an adults drone(!?) but i've never seen one like this! or some kind of floating lantern or some kind of illuminated, triangular rocket-shaped balloon; but then it rotated a bit and i could see the wings on it. kind of like the wings on a rocket shaped craft; but the body of this thing was more triangular shaped with the wider part of the body almost more rectangular when you can't see the wings. when it rotated i could see the wings coming to a point at the nose and getting wider toward the base or back end. once i realized it was ascending and moving towards me, i realized it was moving rather quickly both up and ne. i estimated i watched it about 7 minutes, maybe 5 at the least till it was out of sight. don't know how to estimate mph for something like this. i still have an old cell phone, so didn't even try to take a picture cause it just wouldn't have turned out anything. darn! gotta get a new phone!! sorry about that. i did think about it at the time and would have if the camera had been any good. i remember looking around hoping to see someone else maybe out walking their dog too! so i could show them and ask what they thought it was. cars were going by on the street, no one seemed to notice. there were no dog walkers. i was literally standing right across from the local high school, where a game had ended about 30 min prior. there were people working out there cleaning up with all the bright lights on. but no one was looking up! everyone else had gone home. i just couldn't believe it. was i the only one to see this??? surely there is someone else out there who saw this thing and maybe even got a picture too!! i hope. because this craft was glowing red, i couldn't help think it was a child's toy. you know, red! red, toy red, festive red, happy red, party red. but red also means other things to other people. warning red, stop red, danger red, toxic red. i wonder what this red meant?? there were no lights on this thing. it just glowed red and i think i could see what looked like seams in the body of it. you know, darker lines where pieces were connected together perhaps. i could not see any windows. there might have been some, i just could not see them from where i was. it was obviously powered by something, but i couldn't hear it making any sound from my vantage point.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":61441,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.450037339353464,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11162014-0006","longitude":-122.67192139461528,"occurred":1416038400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1416139222000,"summary":"Red glowing craft ascended for appx 7 min from ne while heading sw, up through the cloud cover until gone. craft rotated slightly revealing triangular wings protruding from it. 2 maybe 4-don't know for sure.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"95405","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Santa Rosa, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:82793"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Jefferson","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While driving home i saw a bright light hovering on the opposite side of the main road across from\r\nme my subdivision. as i turned into my subdivision i lost sight of it due to my direction of travel. i then saw it again as i made another turn and it appeared to be much closer. when i turned on the street be for my street i could see a very bright light, i would estimate less than 100 feet above ground,in the direction of my house. as i turned on my street, i realized that it was next to my house. i backed into my driveway and was afraid to get out of my car because it was so close. i am not a fearful person but was told terrified by this incident. i started to video but then became afraid to have my phone up in the window to video. i sat my phone in my lap and laid the seat back in my car so that i was laying down i watched the light for over an hour and it would disappear then reappear in the same place. most of the time it was hovering but occasionally made sudden, short but very rapid movements sometimes horizontally and vertically. there was absolutely no noise coming from the object. i was so afraid that i didn't get out of the car until it ascended high enough that i felt comfortable that i could get to my door but i could still see the object. while the object was in close range i was nearly paralyzed with fear, as i have never seen anything like it in my life. i am familiar with all types of aircraft and i do not know of anything that can hover at this altitude and make no noise. i was able to get 13 minutes of video that i was unaware i was taping i have provided this video to the state director of mufon.

facing west when something caught my eye to the south about 100 feet in the air.  \r\nit was before the moon had appeared on the horizon and the sky was very dark, the stars that night were very bright the time was approximately 6:45 pm (i sent my sister a text message about ufo at 6:49 pm). when i looked up to the south i was looking directly at a metal tower of some sort (radio-telephone) with a red light on top. there was some illumination from a billboard in front of tower. i saw a silent shape move very slowly perhaps 25mph (guess) fly over the tower and my head and continue to the north i was only able to see the ufo from roughly 60 yards away to the south and 60 yards away to the north. i could only see a moving blur until the object was directly overhead and the stars in the background were covered up as the shape passed between them and me, it was then i could see the outline of the craft. it appeared to be a diamond shape. if the stars weren't there i would have not been able to see the shape. i would guess its wing span was 25 foot to 50 foot max. i was so excited and in shock it is hard to say for sure on the size. i was very excited and not at all scared like one may think. i was wishing i could have watched it longer. the sighting occurred on hwy 97 in oregon just se of the diamond lake junction turn off. if i was to guess i would say it must have been

turning the corner my friend was looking up to the northeast and i followed his gaze. there were 2 orange/yellow orbs crossing the sky, slowly and without noise. we just looked at each other and continued to watch as the first disappeared and as the second one moved off another came in behind. i then remarked to my friend \"i'm glad you're here this time to see this\" as i jumped up into the truck bed and stood on the rails for a better view. from this higher advantage point i could see 3 orbs, they seemed to be coming out of the nne\r\nbut making a slow arc or turn to the ne-east..Something clicked in my mind and i asked my friend to get his camera..He had never before or since moved so fast and was in the house and back in seconds. he begin taking pictures and a video of the objects as they came into sight while i remained standing on the rails of the truck. i counted 9 orbs, all in a linear formation doing a slow arc appearing out of the nne turning and disappearing in the east. there was no sound heard(very quiet night)and i observed the orbs pulsating in a 1-2-pause-3 sequence...Orange-yellow-white as i studied them intently, i could or so it seemed feel the pulse.\r\nthese objects were moving too slow for an aicraft and the entire incident lasted about 4 minutes.\r\n the reason i was glad my friend was there and why this is the incident i am reporting is that i have had several different encounters over the previous months, this being the first with a witness and actually getting photos and a video. the previous events i have experienced...Were different..Really strange..Hard to explain in words...Hopefully you will inquire so that i could perhaps make more sense of it all. thank you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

noticed something out the window and exclaimed \"oh my god. i think i see a ufo\". i jumped up and ran to the window, and lo and behold, i saw the most unusual extremely bright orange orb traversing the sky in a flight path similar to that of an airplane. it was so unusual that i was unable to gauge its approximate altitude. my guess would be slightly less than that of the typical airplane. to my eye it appeared about the size of a penny, whereas a jet in the sky would appear to be about the size of an ant. unlike an airplane, this orb was one solid luminous entity. it seemed to travel about twice the speed of the average jet in the night sky, maintained a remarkably even flight path, and eerily made no sound whatsoever. i could not make out the description of any type of craft per se, just a glowing orb. by the way, all nearby airports were long closed for the night.\r\n   i'm very familiar with what is known as chinese lanterns which are set up into the sky. these are hot air bags set aflame that rise into the night sky, casting a fireball type image. they tend to rise (due to their heat) and can oftentimes get caught in the wind and move across the sky before eventually burning out. the orb i saw was not the same. it was much larger and brighter and traversed the clear night sky from the horizon in the west to the horizon in the east at a very steady pace. it gave off a tremendous amount of light. it also traveled much slower than a meteor or shooting star and never diminished or increased in speed or luminosity. it was always round like an orb and had the color and brightness of the setting sun over the ocean. the orb itself gave off no surrounding haze or glow and left no trail. \r\n   my wife and i watched in wonderment as this otherworldly night visitor traversed the sky and after about 30 seconds finally disappeared from our sight out into the eastern horizon. we were both immediately quite certain that we had witnessed a space craft that i could only describe as otherworldly. we were very excited but neither of us were scared. in fact, it had an odd calming effect because the object itself seemed so intelligent and sophisticated. i wouldn't hesitate to use the term spiritual.\r\n   our exciting night immediately got a whole lot more interesting when we suddenly noticed an exact similar orb appearing precisely where the first one came from. this second orb was the exact same size and color as the first, and traveled precisely the same flight path. as this second light eventually started disappearing from view, yet another orb came along in the same flight path. we saw three identical orbs over the course of under 5 minutes. i know that it wasn't one orb circling back because i distinctly saw two at the same time. after a 10 minute hiatus, a 4th orb appeared and behaved exactly the same. after that there were no more.\r\n   the experience was so magical that it never occurred to me to leave the window and get a camera. put me down as a first-time ufo believer.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

of scipio utah my friend said \"holy *+=&^- there is a ufo\".  i leaned forward and looked up and there was a round object maybe 100 feet above the road pacing us.  it had orange paneled lights emitting from the bottom it was perfectly round as viewed from underneath it.  \r\n\r\ni had never heard anything negative about ufo's at the time so i immediately hit the breaks and started to pull over (for me it was the most exciting thing that had ever happened).   my friend however was so scared and terrified that i was worried about her health.  i have never in my life witnessed so much fear in a person and so i did not pull over but rather just kept on going.  i did not see it but she said we lost sight of it in some trees near the road.\r\n\r\njust after we lost sight of the ufo i felt a strange and uncomfortable energy enter into the car.  i practice a form of energy healing for a living and so i forcefully surrounded the car in light which made the energy undetectable.  just as i did this my friend said \"*&^* (and then my name).  i thought she could feel the energy from the ufo and also the energy that i used to surround the car but later i found out that she felt neither of these things but was only just commenting on the fact that we had seen a ufo.\r\n\r\nwhen there was time i asked my friend why she was so scared and she told me that she has memory of being abducted when she was a child and that she has had dreams ever since around the subject of having to at some point go back with them and she thought they were there to take her.\r\n\r\nover the next few months (maybe nine) i had some pretty intense encounters with what i believe are attempted abductions.  i would be willing to share these with a researcher.","distance":"101-500

only cloud in the sky where they were all congregating. shortly after several launches, there was a craft that was solid red probably about 20 miles away in the west. the craft was heading east and remained solid red until it was about 50 yards outside of our bedroom window and did a quick directional change and turned solid blue and then immediately solid green. while it was changing colors, it also changed shape. it emitted a very strange buzzing noise and went from a triangular shape to almost a bug like shape and then sped off and turned solid white. the craft was probably a hundred feet long or so. it appeared to be chasing the small red orbs. after this large craft was out of sight, all of the orbs came out of the single cloud and started going every direction. they would randomly change altitude and go from north to south and east to west in the blink of an eye. another large craft was witnessed coming over the hills to the east and it was maybe 500 feet or so off the ground. it was red white and green and it made no sound at all. all of these events were witnessed by myself, my wife, my 22 year old son, and my 14 year old daughter. this event lasted for over 2 hours. the weirdest thing was when one craft looked like it had a force field around it went about a hundred feet over my house again making no noise at all, went out to the middle of our field and then disappeared at the speed of light. this was also witnessed by all of us. every animal was howling and making as much ruckus as possible. once all of the activities stopped in the sky, all animals went silent. this event ended shortly before 2 o'clock in the morning. all of this took place in enumclaw washington on november 13th 2014. we were unable to get video of the craft while it was close to our house because none of our cell phones would work. my daughter was able to get a video at a distance the third time the triangular shaped craft was making the rounds again.","distance":"101-500

at about 10 pm and was startled to see 2 huge, bright orange objects in the sky in front of me, roughly in the sky above the new york city area. because the area is close to newark airport my initial reaction was i thought 2 planes were on fire. then i realized the objects were not moving but rather were hovering next to each other. there was no noise. after about 20 seconds of stunned disbelief, i called my wife out to the deck and she also observed the objects. at this time a plane was crossing directly under the objects en route to landing at newark airport. the objects continued to hover for approximately 30 more seconds as the plane landing at newark passed below and in front of them, all the while glowing a bright orange/red color. the objects then started to get smaller as they appeared to be rising into the sky. within 5-10 seconds, as they got smaller and smaller, they just winked out of sight. the total time of observation was about 1 minute.","distance":"Over One

students of the economic faculty in the time that the event took place.In those moments a huge force blocked my heart and brain, and i was like a statue, in my soul i felt the smell of basil, it was as a clinical death to me, people who were around i just could not see them and i hardly listened to them. than that same force moved me throw the cosmos and there i felt the tremendous force of gravity. i was very cold and  because of the force of the gravity i felt that i could be fractured into pieces. furthermore, i heard a sound of a engine like from an airplane. than that same force brought me inside the ufo.When that same force brought me inside, in that same moment i knew that those are entity’s and a object from another civilization.As i already sad i was witness of the object but inside the ufo, so about the actions that the entity’s did i can assure you that i know the process but because is very complicated i want to speak about this with someone directly from your organization. and if is possible even if needed to do that in the usa. so about the motions and actions of the ufo outside i can not witness because i have seen it inside.In those moments i was very upset and afraid , because i could not describe the appearance and did not know if i would stay alive and will that same force brought me back to earth. and about the actions, i had no power over myself and this same force opened my eyes and showed the actions of the entity’s inside the ufo and for sure it showed me the process of flying with the ufo. this is also important that after so many years occasionally, while watching television it reminds me on the most important action of the process of flying with the ufo. i strongly believe that during me being inside the ufo i was invisible for the entity’s, because one of the entity’s was like three feet’s from me and i thought that it was watching me and like it was smiling to me, it was faintly in his face it had long face and it had long yellow hair, also long beard, unshaved. what wondered me the most was that it moved the eyelids fast and i could not see the color of his eyes. those entity’s are about 110 cm tall, they walk slowly, they have small fingers of their hands and also they have a strong tone of voice. while walking they walk with bent knees.That same force ejected me from the same entry i got inside. the entry was on roof of the ufo.I also want to say that while they are walking\r\nthey snore and also they had very sophisticated equipment. i saw two entity's doing the process of flying with the ufo.They work very precisely\r\nand their process of flying is divided.In addition i have that sketch from\r\nthe inside of the ufo that you can also see, for the colors of some things\r\ni remember, for some i do not, but the system of flying i know it perfectly\r\nand i need people that can test me about this things, because i want to build the ufo with you.Because with these flyings object's usa may become\r\nthe most powerful cosmic power in the world,it would be possible to conquest the planet's far away with crew's, and minimum spent energy.I hope\r\nto hear from you soon and also hope that you understand me because the society where i live does not.\r\nbest regards   \r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or
