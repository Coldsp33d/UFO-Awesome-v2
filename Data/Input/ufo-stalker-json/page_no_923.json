previous observations.\r\n\r\nthe last observation was in fact kind of scary. i saw the flash of light almost directly north (beneath polaris). this time the light was slightly more yellow. for some

noticing the flashes, same as the other flashes. i wasn't looking all over the sky. i was just looking at a particular point in the sky and that's where the flashes occurred. \r\n\r\nthe flashes

1965.\r\nat the time i was eleven years old. i am a retired air force intelligence officer (major), and veteran of the gulf war. \r\n\r\ni was sitting looking out a window when i saw a large bright object descending at a fast rate of speed. it was coming down at a 45% angle at perhaps fifty miles per hour. i thought it was a rocket, because of its shape, a cylinder with rounded ends. i ran and hid behind the couch away from the window. i expected an explosion but heard nothing, so i looked out. i saw the ufo hovering a block down the street over roof tops.\r\n\r\nthe ufo had descended at 22nd street, descending at the intersection of 22nd and mount vernon street, moving north then stopping at 22nd and wallace street. i was viewing the object from my grandmother and grandfather's 3rd floor apartment window at 643 north 22nd street, philadelphia pa on june 25th 1968.\r\nthe ufo followed the outline of all the homes and buildings-opposite my side of the street, including a church. it flew just feet above the roof tops.\r\n\r\nit would pause, descend, and rise, hovering about ten feet above all the roof tops. it was as if it was viewing inside the homes. it moved slowly traveling at walking pace.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was the length of a city bus, with rounded ends, but wider in circumference. it was a large cylinder, it had no markings of any kind, no wings, no visible engines, no windows. the entire surface was made up of a plasma field, like a close up image of the sun. these gases or ions spun and disappeared under the surface, diving and rising like a gas. the brightness was intense. it was composed of several colors, white, yellow and orange. it reminded me of someone mixing giant cans of paint. it was very beautiful but hard on the eyes because of its brilliance. \r\n\r\nat one point i turned around looking behind me into the apartment and noticed the patterns of light also produced shadows on my grandmothers walls. the patterns it produced on the walls were dark with light edges. the patterns matched the moving patterns of the vessel's surface. the only thing i've ever seen similar are close up films of the sun. in addition to the swirling patterns of light i noticed it was layered in a dimple pattern that covered it's entire surface. the dimples appeared to vibrate but stayed in place like those on a basketball while plumes of gas rose and fell like filaments of a magnet. this was truly amazing to see! at times i used my hands to shield my eyes. it was the brightest light i've ever seen and today i'm sixty years old, as of november 2014. i was alone viewing the object. my grandfather was at work and my grandmother went downstairs to another apartment for a short time.\r\n\r\nit approached my location stopping directly in front of me. i did not feel any heat. at this point it was about 80 feet away, close enough to throw a ball to it! i was able to observe this object for perhaps five minutes in total, which seemed then to be a long time. as i said it paused several times over apartments, then would move and stop again several times.\r\n\r\njust before the ufo changed direction (descending, or rising, stopping or starting to move forward) it emitted a loud sound. the sound always preceded its change in movement by about two seconds each time. so i knew when it was going to move again. the sound reminded me of a loud hiss from an old steam train. i'm not saying there was steam just that the sound was similar to that or when a large truck makes releasing air brakes. \r\n\r\nonce the ufo got to the last building at the intersection of 22nd and fairmont streets it angled at 45 degrees, with its front end pointing up, it rose about fifty feet.\r\n i ran to another window on the side facing wallace street, so was able to watch it again. it leveled off, then flew over the walls of the eastern state penitentiary, it picked up speed at about 35 miles per hour flying north. it continued flying north at a level constant speed until i lost view of it. this craft was definitely controlled by an intelligence. \r\n\r\nwhen my grandmother came in i told her what i had witnessed. we were both very religious, she had difficulty believing my story and asked me to swear by placing my hand on the bible, which i did. she was convinced and saddened that she had missed this wonderful sight by just minutes.\r\n\r\nthat evening or perhaps the next night we watched a tv program that highlighted the vessel i had seen and their closer encounter with it. the program was \"the arthur godfrey show\", or one of his \"specials\". arthur godfrey was a respected pilot, and was a colonel in the air force reserve. arthur godfrey and frank munciello another experienced pilot were flying in a small aircraft from new york to washington dc. their flight path took them over or near philadelphia on the same day of my encounter. live on national tv author godfrey described that a brilliantly lit vessel followed and maneuvered around his aircraft. he said it matched his course and speed. he admitted he was scared of the vessel's close maneuvers until it finally veered off. arthur godfrey was a well know tv producer and tv host.  his tv program was viewed by millions of americans. my grandparents and i knew he was describing the same vessel i had seen. an account of arthur godfrey's story can be read on ufodocarchiv.Org.\r\n\r\nlater as an intelligence officer i often gave my squadron current intelligence briefings. i was an intelligence officer of the 732nd military airlift squadron at mcguire air force base in new jersey. i served in this position for approximately ten years, including during the gulf war. during one briefing an aircrew explained to me they encountered a ball lightening encounter, also called saint elmo's fire. a sphere of charged particles entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet. the aircraft was a c-141 starlifter. the sphere about three feet in diameter entered the cockpit then floated inside the aircraft to the cargo bay where it hovered for a time then vanished. they asked of i entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet. the aircraft was a c-141 starlifter. the sphere about three feet in diameter entered the cockpit then floated inside the aircraft to the cargo bay where it hovered for a time then vanished. the entire crew witnesses the sphere and actually enjoyed the event. they asked if i knew of any ufo sightings. i then told them my story. this upset my squadron training officer who verbally reprimanded me, i was ordered to never speak about ufo's again.","distance":"21-100

second floor balcony for a smoke. it faces due south with an excellent view of the sky both south and southeast.  there is a regional airport directly to the southeast about 1 mile away of which i have an excellent view, the north/south runway. so, the moment i walk on to the balcony i look to the sky and see what i first take to be the lights of a plane.  it looks like its banking a turn from east to west turning due south. but, as i began to register everything, it was different from a plane. i'm very familiar with the sights and sounds of planes going about their daily routines, from single engine props doing touch-and-go's to jet charters flying in and out.  i know their sounds and heights and speeds.  this just didn't register as a plane after initial notice.  it was completely silent. it moved faster than a plane landing or taking off. and the lights weren't right, for a plane.  while they were visible,they were almost muted? i might say. visible but not bright like a regular light. color i'd say was...Muted light jade?  it all happened so fast even as i'm trying to note things it's getting more difficult to notice and mentally mark what i'm seeing. like after i was like, \"was it three lights or four? was there one red one? what exact configuration were the lights, triangle, square, cross-like. so...It was going south parallel to the runway path, seemingly about 1000 yards to the west, and too high for touch-and-go's, then somewhere downrange it moved ninety degrees west.  it's path i mean.  at this point it was hard to see, i had to look slightly away from the object to see it more clearly at night. then i lost it.  the reason i'm filing this report is...This isn't the first time i've seen strange things in the night sky overhead going south, silently. it's the third time.  the first two no \"lights\" were visible at all, i wondered those times if i'd seen a solitary bird flying at night, but i saw no flapping.  and i would say in all three incidents, height, direction and mostly speed, all were about the same.  i'm not a \"ufo\" kind of guy. i don't follow \"ufo\" stuff. also, i know what the space station looks like, like a bright star moving like a satellite. this wasn't that either. eventually, rather quickly really, i just lost sight of it...I just couldn't see it anymore. how i felt when i saw it?? i just thought, \"what am i seeing??\" that's about it i guess.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

rather large cigar shaped object with five bright white lights that set horizontally in a row; the lights illuminating the fog above the object. it caught my attention mostly because of the brightness of the lights and it’s size. my initial thought was that it was a plane, but the object did not appear to be moving. it just seemed to hover there, only a few miles away. i watched it for a moment and then grabbed my phone to take a picture. instead of taking a picture i luckily accidentally recorded a short video. i was able to catch it on the video and screenshot an image.

it seemed so close as i could see the object and all the lights clearly. i stood and watched it for about 1 min until it passed over the building i worked in and out of my line of sight.  once it was gone i quickly went into the building and reported the sighting to a coworker. he just laughed at me and said i was having pregnancy induced hallucinations. this was actually the second ufo sighting i witnessed. i realize too much time has passed to investigate, but my thought is that perhaps my story might corroborate another sighting reported at the same time. i no knowledge that mufon even existed until watching a ufo program on t.V.
