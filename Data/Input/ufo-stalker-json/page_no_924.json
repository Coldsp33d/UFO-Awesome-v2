making different shapes, going one direction, then going the opposite direction in a diagonal path. this continued as it got closer and closer. it looked as it was dropping things, picking up things. we watched as beams of lights (red,yellow) came from what would be from the front and backs of the ufo. the main star like light gave the ship a dull outline of the size. when it would reach one point in the sky, it was easily seen that is was turning to make its rounds. soon we would even see it shot rounds of three red orbs onto the ground. and then for a few short seconds, the ufo was visible, clarifying what it was. it had a larger rectangular body. violet in color, with two arms at the front of the ship that had turned, making the entire ship turn with them. we watched for about 5 hours before the ship took off. when it took off into the night sky, you could see a tail of fuel of something it left when it would change course slightly. it looked to have hidden behind a sphere like object, that was only noticed by its light disappearing behind it, right before sunrise. i was in shook, i pinched myself to make sure i was not dreaming and asked my friends more then once if he was seeing all of this. there is much more detail, that is imprinted into my head but would take hours to describe. please if anyone else saw this, report it. anyone in the missouri area. i did leave one thing out, all pictures that where taken where wiped from my sd card right after, and the camera i used was drained of its battery's 3 times trying to capture a picture.. this is what freaked me out

cigarette. i had my whole house lit up inside and had all my sliding doors and windows open. i was casually looking around outside when something caught my eye above the treeline and power lines that run all the way down my neighborhood. when i first witnessed it, it appeared to just be coming out of a gradual and smooth right turn. it seemed to almost hover for a second and continue south when i yelled for my wife to come outside. she ran out in a matter of 5 seconds and i said \"what is that, do you see what i see?\" she looked up and at that time it was straightened out and heading south, appearing to be above the treeline by a couple hundred feet. the object looked like a boomerang or triangle shape and almost faded into the night sky and was lit up by the moon (once it got closer to the moon, we could see it a little clearer). it glided effortlessly with no apparent sound and no lights that we saw. it was a clear night, not a cloud in the sky. it was well lit by the half moon. this object appeared to be gray/black but seemed to change like a mirage and we had to focus to see it until it went too far into the distance we could no longer see it. when i first saw it, i quickly tried to rationalize this to being a large flock of geese or large turkey vulture or some sort of large bird. i even thought it may have been a hang-glider. this all went through my brain within 2 seconds and once i dismissed all of these possibilities is when i yelled for my wife to come out which is when she saw it too. neither of us have any explanation for what we saw in that short 20 seconds or so. we both felt confused, baffled and excited! i have also felt a little bit of anxiety. we tried to contact mufon of florida by email the very next day but have never heard back. almost 2 weeks later and we can't get it out of our minds and keep thinking back on it. we are very curious if there were other sightings in our

small crowd of teenagers and young adults standing in the middle of the street ahead of us.  i had to stop the bike in order to avoid hitting them.  all of them were staring up in the air toward the south of the road above the large parking lot which had once been an old rinks department store and had been turned into a tractor trailer parking lot.\r\n\r\nmy fiancee and i looked up to the left and saw three painfully bright white lights arrange in a triangular formation fairly close together.  as my eyes adjusted i made out the shape of a very large parallogram-shaped object suspended above the parking lot.  the two of us debated what it was for a moment and we both realized the object had no visible means of support and was not making any sound at all.  i could see that the falling snow was leaving an outline of the object below it on the surface of the parking lot.\r\n\r\nat this point my fiance began to get pretty hysterical and demanded that we leave.  but i said that i wanted to get a closer look.  so i parked the bike and walked across the parking lot until i reached a distance of perhaps fifty or sixty feet horizontally away from the object.\r\n\r\nas i got closer i realized that it was not quite as large or as high up as i had initially thought.  there were a few semi tractor trailers parked in the lot and using them as a size reference i would estimate the length of the object to be roughly 120 to 150 feet and it was hovering absolutely motionless about 50 feet off the ground.  it was a dull silvery-grey color overall and was covered in what appeared to be panels or plates some of which protruded perhaps a few feet here and there in geometric shapes, mostly squares and rectangles.  when i walked toward the opposite end of the object i saw five light blue rectangles which covered most of that end.  they appeared to be illuminated from the inside and i saw what appeared to be several fuzzy, indistinct outlines of human or humanoid shaped figures.\r\n\r\nfrom the time i reached perhaps 100 feet or so from the object i felt a very odd sensation which i honestly can only describe as having my sense of the passage of time distorted such that i could not tell if i stood there for five minutes or for an hour.  the sensation grew stronger the closer i got. it was a very unnerving and overwhelming sensation. \r\n\r\nafter some time, i'm not sure how long, i saw an intense blue column of light emitted from the bottom center of the object to the ground.  i think this lasted for a few seconds but am honestly uncertain.  again, there was still no sound at all and i remember being aware of actually hearing snowflakes hitting the ground.\r\n\r\nthe next thing i recall was the object moving vertically and still soundlessly at an extremely high velocity so that it was out of sight almost instantly.\r\n\r\ni then walked back to the motorcycle and my fiancee and noticed that the other people who had been on the street were all gone.  my fiancee was very  angry at me and still hysterical as we finished our motorcycle ride.\r\n\r\nthe two of us were never married and have not seen each other or had any contact since 1986 or so.\r\n\r\ni would just like to follow up by saying that at the time this occurred i was a sergeant in the usafr serving as an aeromedical evacuation tech.  i didn't report anything at the time since i didn't want it to affect my service record.  later i didn't report it because my brother was a usaf cryptographer at the foreign technologies division at wright patterson afb and i did not want to cause him more stress than he already had.  sadly my brother died ten years ago and i finally decided i really should report what we saw.\r\n\r\nadditionally i am a licensed pilot and aircraft builder.  i first soloed in 1979.  i spent most of the last thirty years as a software developer.","distance":"21-100

red and dark blue lights through the holes in my blinds. i immediately dismiss it thinking it was another airplane passing through. but thirty minutes later, its still there. me, being my curious self, turn off my lights and look outside. when i see it, my heart catches in my throat. it was really large i could see it clearly. it was a giant silver dome with flashing pink and site lights underneath and on top where the cockpit should be. but where the lights were underneath thew ship, there were long transculent tentacles that would change color. i observed for a few more minutes and saw it looked like it as pulsating with electricity. waves of pink, blue, green, yellow, and white would ripple throughout the whole body. it would shine and sparkle every time it pulsed with electricity. i stared in awe for what seemed like forever, then realized that it could be an alien ship, and tip toe into my parents room. i show my mother the ufos, she tells me to get down and get off of facebook (i was already posting what i drew because i have a crappy phone camera and couldn't take a photo in the dark.) i'm kinda freaking out with excitement, so i joke about the nazis coming to get us, and she tells me to go back to sleep its not aliens. every time i would bring it up, she would berate me. so i lay down awake in cold sweat, too filled with excitement and adrenaline to sleep. two hours later, they're still there hovering in their jellyfish craft, but this time its glowing a bright blue, then i hear a deafening hum and it disappears. in star wars, when they go into hyperspace, the ship looks like its being stretched out, then they disappear. that's exactly what this ship did, except left a blue streak behind for the briefest of seconds, then dissipated.

Quinta","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"   on 110814 i was vacationing with family (wife and child) in la quinta ca.  after spending the day hours in downtown palm springs we returned to our rental in la quinta ca. we changed and headed for the pool. we rode our bikes from our home to a pool located near the main gate of the community. we swam in the pool and then moved to the hot tub. \r\n   while in the hot tub we relaxed and stargazed, as we often do while we are there. i began looking west towards the santa rosa mountains admiring the numerous stars in the night sky. we talked about how dark it was compared with home in oregon for the time of day, it was around 1815 to 1840 hours. we chatted about how many stars were visible and how pleasant it was out. \r\n   a movement in the sky next to a 2 palm trees which line the interior sw corner of the pool landscaping caught my eye. i thought at first it must be the shadow of a large bird flapping its wings. it took a second for me to realize it was not bird in flight. the object was not just behind the palm tree but in the sky beyond it. it occupied the airspace between my location and the mountain. as it moved across the sky from behind the palm tree i saw it was large. its size made it difficult to judge its actual dimensions (i would guess as large as a commercial airliner) or its altitude in the sky. frankly, its appearance confused me so could only base my observations by comparing it to the mountain and palm trees. from my vantage point it was as large as the top of the palm tree fronds (not its actual size but the object was in the distance and still looked about the size palm tree top) this palm tree is about 40 feet tall and the object was about the same size in the sky. its altitude seemed to be no more than the height of the mountain that runs adjacent to the community on the far west side.\r\n   when i first noticed the object it seemed blurry. it moved into a clearing passed the palm trees at an angle just in front of me. there were no obstructions between myself and the object. it was literally right in front of me. the night sky was my backdrop as it moved across the sky. it was a large equilateral triangle. its height was far less in comparison to its length of its sides. the outside of it was darker than the night sky but it blended into the sky above it. the object itself was black and seemed shiny when it was at its most focused point (meaning the shape was blurry and then came into focus). i could make out the outer edges of the triangle and also the whole body as it blocked the stars in the sky it passed in front of. i could not make out any surface details.\r\n   each corner of the triangle housed a round light. the lights were not small beacon lights but quite large. the round lights were not extremely bright and seemed a muted yellow even dim. the lights did not pulsate or flash like airplane beacons either.  it also appeared clearer to me the more directly in front of me it was. it continued across the sky until it was ne of me. it passed behind more palm trees at which point i lost it in the sky and could no longer locate it. the object made no noise and seemed completely silent.\r\n   the aircraft moved from the sw towards the ne across the sky. it moved slowly but never stopped, slower than a c130 at an airshow slow. the entire aircraft slowly rotated on its axis. i believe it rotated counter clockwise. it did not change direction or altitude. its movement across the sky seemed effortless. it seemed to float in the air like a raft would float on the water but light like cottonwood seed fuzz. a smooth movement like a ball bearing rolling across a glass top table. its movement was very different than any plane, helicopter or balloon i have ever seen. smooth, slow, light and effortless.\r\n   during the time i was watching the object i attempted to point it out to my wife and young son. neither were able to see it and they told me i was quite excited while pointing toward it and not making much sense to them. i described to them what i saw a large triangle with three round lights in the corners slowly rotating as it moved across the sky. \r\n   important things about this siting. this was a calm night with little to no breeze. this particular community proximity to mountain makes flying a plane, helicopter too dangerous/not possible especially at night without lights. the community has only ground lighting. the community is far away from city lights. the community is flanked by the santa rosa mountains to the west blocking all light pollution from the west. the community is also far away from urban areas and is quite quiet, especially in the evenings. the object was much lower than any plane i have witnessed above the property. most planes i have seen are flying at cruising altitudes far above the mountains. the helicopters i have seen are military and also fly well above the mountains. i believe we had a full moon on the 8th but the moon starts low at the horizon line until it moves upwards into the sky later in the evening. \r\n\r\n  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

up at the stars. the night in question was clear with lots of stars visible. i noticed the slight drone of aircraft engines and watched two airplanes approach each other from opposite directions. their path was above the treetops in the distance, and it appeared that they crossed paths, although i know there was distance between them. as i recall, their flight paths were fairly level at that particular time and place.\r\n\r\nwhile i was watching the planes, i noticed what i thought was a particularly bright star well above the path of the airplanes. as the planes moved out of sight, i suddenly saw the bright light make a slow, steady descent in a completely straight line. it stopped just beneath the distant tree line, but i could see the light hover (very still) between the branches. i then watched the light ascend in a perfectly straight line and hover at about the same height as when i first saw it. the light descended a second time exactly the same as the first time, hovered, and then rose again in a straight line. this time, it seemed to hover just a little higher in the sky. \r\n\r\nwhen it descended the third time, it descended in a zigzag manner with a very slight trail of light following the zigzag motion. it hovered just below the treeline before i lost sight of it. \r\n\r\nthe entire event happened over the course of about six or seven minutes. i had looked at the clock on my way out and the time was 9:01. it was a couple of minutes before i noticed the light. when i came in, the time was 9:11.  i had called my husband and he came out and saw it just before it reached the treeline level on its third descent.  \r\n\r\ni was amazed and perplexed by the sighting. i had clearly heard the distant sound of the two planes that seemed to be moving in a flight line only slightly closer to me than the light. while i heard the planes, there was no sound at all from the light. i have been an outdoor camper since childhood, and i've never seen a light, a helicopter, or plane move in such a fashion. i also worked for years just outside rickenbacker air base and live very close to port columbus, so i am accustomed to seeing planes and helicopters. i have never seen anything in the sky that maneuvered like what i saw that night.
