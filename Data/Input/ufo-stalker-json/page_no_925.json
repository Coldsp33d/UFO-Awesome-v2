observing planes stars moon, clear sky + no clouds + a few days after full moon. perfect night to see the sky + beyond. i'm disabled, getting around + sleeping are a problem some days so in nice weather i sit outside with + without different binoculars. i have some back round in the aircraft repair industry + am still interested + also love looking at the stars + moon. my son is an aircraft tech at jfk airport + everything that flies military + civilian are discussed regularly. i'm no stranger to different crafts + shapes that are seen above us. as i observed the moon with just my eyes i noticed a star \"blinked\" east of the moon, i checked afterwards + the star if i held a ruler at the end of my arm from the star to the moon was about 1.5 inches, i'll look up star charts to try to identify it later tonight. then looking closer i saw a triangle shape pass between myself + the moon in an wsw direction. from my perspective it was covered 1/4-1/3 of the moon. if i had to guess it was more than 20,000 ft in altitude, i'm sure someone can do the math to approximate the size. it took about 2 seconds to cross + go out of sight. about 10 seconds later it blocked out a star again using the ruler at the end of my arm about 3.5-4 inches to the wsw. the triangle did follow a straight line path. i will try to identify this star also. i tried to look for a few minutes longer but did not observe any other stars \"blinking\" or movements. i checked charts to see if the iss or any other satellites were in the area + found none. at the same time there were 2 other planes in sight, one heading south about 30-40 degrees to the west of my position + i wondered if it would interfere with the triangle but i observed the plane until it passed the horizon to my sw. another aircraft was to my ne but it was quite a distance from what i observed. i'm sure of what i observed + was not drugged or drunk as i am on a rigid medicine schedule + self medicating may kill me. i believe in ufo's and saw some in oct 2010 but didn't report them as many people did here in nyc there was numerous sightings over a period of days. i've also read many ufo reports so i've entered as much information as i can. thanks for your time, i hope this helps.","distance":"Over One

carried away, and a strong power of star beings observing me from my window. i first recall my first encounter when i was 4 years old when i lived next door to a farm ranch in salem oregon. i awoke to the power of something that came to me in my sleep, but i could not recall what it was that scares me,but the presence of it is was still very thick in the house. i went out of my room to escape to my mothers room, and my intentions were to scream \"mom\" come help me, but as my lips barely got the first 2 letters of \"mom out, my body and thoughts and my whole existence was paralyzed in motion. from that time my mother noticed a small hole in each of my ears, but she discontinued them as my dad had them. i had ear aches that year so bad i had to be hospitalized. as the years went by my mother would move from place to place, and find that when she would throw a diaper on me the diaper would disappear, and all my bedding was thrown around the room.\r\n\r\n we lived still in salem oregon across the street from the main post office, and that is where memory of encounter 2 happened. i awoke from something awful, and it was about 4:15 and my step dad was gone for work, i awoke to my mom screaming, all the curtains shut, and the television was screaming loud fuzz, all at the same time. i looked in my moms room from a distance to catch glimpse of an object hovering above her, which in turn found out to be the clock in her room.\r\n\r\n when i was living on court st. in salem oregon, i seen a 3 ring red or-bed ufo hovering over the house when i for some reason wanted to go outside and take a look. these were my mork and mindy days. through out the years i still want to awake from the stuff that's happening to me while i am paralyzed in my sleep. all my nose doctors say they have never seen a hole in the left side of my nose that big before. i told my doctor my brain was hurting me, so they gave an mri to find the foreign object that's in the left side of my brain, and he said the only way to remove it is brain surgery.I have a hole underneath my tear duct that is 2 inches deep, same with the small holes in both ears, and i have to pencil sized holes under my tongue, that go very very deep.\r\n\r\n my first time i seen an et was when i was 19 years old. the event of the appearance came from seeing the star playing peekaboo in and out of a tree right outside, looking out the house windows, from within side the house. my friends mother saw it and seen that it pace back and forth from this tree outside, so she and i went on a ufo hunt in her truck, this ufo turned bright red right before our very eyes and very slowly moved over the hill. very pridefully moved as if its not scared. that following night i was in a trance in my sleep again and decided in my sleep, 'i am going to over power this, i am going to force my eyes to open and open my eyes went, to see i was out of my bed and in the living room on my back and on the ground. i caught the eyes of this moon colored creature hovering above me, as i began to gaze in its eyes it floated out the sliding glass doors from the room. i have much more encounters, but will try to keep this shorter.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

able then to see 3 lights-1 was white, 1 was green, 1 was orange-ish...And to my utter amazement i could literally see the triangle that connected the 3 lights! the traingle was like all grey, metal, chrome, lead colored- darker and more dull in places and shinier more reflective in others- it hovered over the interstate! made absolutely no noise! i seen it right out my front windshield! because i was druving about 55/60mph i went under it and lost sight-so i yelled to my husband to look up and out his passenger window-and asked what it that?!?!? he said slowly, ummmm, i don't know what it is, but it's not anything he'd ever seen, he said it was a triangle too-connected by the 3 lights at each point-not a helicopter, not a plane, not a kite, it was huge and very low-it looked higher when i first observed it but when it went over us-it was like directly above us-maybe a football field up in distance-because we were traveling i had to turn onto 280 and we lost sight if it! the feeling was surreal, as though it was a dream because who sees a ufo at 6:45pm in toledo? well the answer is us! it was a ufo! a triangle ufo, metal, with lights and no noise...I'm still in awe of what i seen that night...We had camera phones, but i couldn't grab mine driving and my husbands phone battery was almost dead-wouldn't take a pic-i ish i could've, i doubt i'll ever see that again!! when i tell
