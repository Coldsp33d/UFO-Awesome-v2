i saw is back, go out on the deck!!!\" \r\n\r\n - (she saw the same thing about two years ago while we were hanging out at the creek that runs through our yard, apparently she saw it to the south and much lower in the sky and says it was humming,  i did not see or hear it that time but i had been drinking, and all i remember was her saying \"what the f..K, run!\"  we ran to/in the house and i asked her what the h..L was wrong? she said \"i just saw a craft\" she described it to me, and i remember getting an intense feeling of terror, like i was frozen and in slow motion at the same time, sort of like sleep paralysis.  i remember sitting on the floor of the kitchen for an hour, afraid to look up because we have skylights.  i’m assuming i was that terrified because i had been drinking and just sprinted up two acres of yard, because this sort of thing isn't something that would normally cause me to freak like that, i have always believed that were not the only intelligent beings in the universe, but until tonight have never seen a ufo.. other than pictures on google.\r\n\r\nanyway, so, she runs in screaming about how this ufo is back, i follow her onto the deck and she is pointing at the sky, i looked up and saw these three stationary orbs in a huge triangle formation (or possibly one big triangle with lights on its tips?) and i immediately started asking myself questions.. are they planes? no, there not moving and not blinking and we live under a flight path near a major airport, so i know what normal commercial jets do and look like,  were also near a military base (where my  roommate works).  is it military? no, they do their stuff to the north, these lights were not in a place they would have been doing anything, especially at 11:30pm on saturday.  where my roommate and i having simultaneous strokes? i doubt it.  is there a gas leak in the house causing hallucinations?  no, its a brand new house with \"everything\" detectors in every room.   is it flares?  no, i looked through binoculars and they were not flickering, not slowly falling, the formation they were in never changed shape.. they were a solid light reddish yellow, almost gold but not as vibrant if that makes sense?  i took my phone out of my pocket, took about ten pictures and a short video, and then just watched them/it for about 5-8 minutes,  i lined them up in my eyesight with the corner of my house to judge weather or not they where moving,  and honestly believe they were not moving. after 5-8 minutes they just went away in an instant, like just gone, no flash, no burn out or anything i just blinked and they were gone!  i have no idea how long they/it was there before i saw it, my roommate told me about it as soon as she saw it, but how long it was there before either of us saw it.. i do not know.     this all happened at around 11:30pm. 11/8/2014\r\n\r\nof the three \"orbs\"  only two showed up in any of the pictures or video, i have no idea why, the third orb (location shown on one of the pics) was the same size and color as the others but was a bit less bright, i believe the clouds where moving in front of this one?  i could see it perfectly in person.  i  took the pics and video with a galaxy s5 smartphone, so there not exactly professional quality. in the video the orbs appear to flicker.. in person they did not, i think this was just me being shaky while recording and possibly clouds.   also, i don’t remember hearing any humming in person but the video seems to have a very low hum to the audio.. my phone has never had that in videos before and i don’t live near anything that would make that sound, like factories or highways or anything.\r\n\r\ni feel like this is waaaay to long and not well written,  that is probably true, since it is now almost 7am.  this is my first ufo sighting and report, and is the last thing i expected to be doing at 7am, so, sorry for that.   i just figured maybe this information could be helpful or interesting in some way.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":61283,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.3295359,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11092014-0008","longitude":-76.51524429999999,"occurred":1415518320000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1415547009000,"summary":"3

eastern standard time on the morning of october 27th 2014. i was just about to head home when i looked up and through the trees and noticed that an orange object the size of a star, in the south southeast part of the sky underneath orion's constellation, (to the left of the star sirius near the constellation of canis minor, more specifically in the location of the star procyon).  seeing the object move out of my vision made me a just where i was standing so that the object was above the treeline and not true the tree line from where i only spotted it. i stood in the street with my dog looking south southeast and watched the star like object, which i thought was a star because of its altitude brightness and color.I soon realized that this object was moving, in different shapes & random patterns near & around its original position in the sky.  i thought that i was hallucinating or simply swing and that the star or object wasn't really moving. so i sat down and stared at the object and over the course of about 20 minutes i watched the object move in s like patterns going in small movements then large movements making stops on a dime and changing direction randomly. i even tried to capture the object through my phone's camera and video camera and was unable to focus in on the object enough to satisfy myself. i didn't want to move from where i originally had spotted it because i was distraught with the fact that this is really happening and no one will believe me because i have no proof to show that it really happen. eventually, they paperboy drove into the neighborhood where i was walking my dog, i flag him down and described to him and point out the star or object in the sky which i had seen. he and i stared at the object for approximately 5 minutes and he is well saw exactly the same movements that i was witnessing. \r\nultimately, i had to return to my house with my dog at about 3:45 a.M.  i immediately grabbed my digital camera with a telephoto lens and tried to take snapshots of the object but i became very frustrated with not being able to zoom in on the object to my satisfaction. i even tried using my mother's digital camera and my father's tablet to try and take video or photos of the object which was still moving and/or replicating its random patterns in the sky. eventually, i became so frustrated with not being able to harness any evidence to prove or back up what i had seen, that i simply said the hell with it went back inside my house and told my parents what i had seen laid in bed try to get some sleep but i was just too worked up to catch any sleep at all. since the sighting i have seen similar objects in the south south eastern part of the sky but in different spots than the original object sighted, moving in random patterns. i have tried to find out whether or not what i'm witnessing is a common occurrence by researching my sighting on the internet with other people's similar sightings. fortunately i have found some peoples stories to be similar to mine but those stories that i have found similar have all taken place in years past. for some reason i am still seeing the original object in the sky moving and dancing around. if someone could explain or perhaps provide a better video camera with telephoto lens, perhaps my sighting can be proven or explained by a professional.","distance":"Over 1

for it to disappear, but we were too cold to remain outside for longer. it made us anxious to see what we believed to be a ufo. we were hoping it would dart off, but it continued to hover, just farther away.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

usual things like a flock of birds would and they seemed to be hovering around the same spot and moved very gracefully. i noticed when the sun hit one that it shined silver and had what looked like darker sides. they stayed in the same area at first point west in a v formation then would turned to point south and as they turned in the sky one would what looked like glide up to the front from one of the sides of the formation. they did not turn like planes. they did not fly like birds. my son stay fixed on the objects and i bent my head and sneezed when i looked back up they were gone disappeared. i asked my son where they went he said mom they just disappeared. i noticed what looked like kind of static on a television or the little white lights tracing across your eyes when you sneeze hard or cough hard in the sky when i was looking for them. i thought it was because i sneezed so i turned to look at the sky behind me to see if i still saw the static like stuff and i did not, however when i turned back to where the objects were i saw it in the sky again there and so did my son. i can't explain it and i'm not a believer in ufos but this was by far the strangest thing i have

traffic from mccarren airport. i looked east to the sky and observed a bright glowing sphere. it moved slowly in a zig zag pattern and then stopped. it then changed course for a short distance and stopped again for a second or two. i then observed it continue on in a straight pattern heading west until it stopped for another second or two and then began to just move slowly straight up into the sky. i then lost track of it but i did manage to get several photos of it before it disappeared. \r\n\r\ni just looked west and it stood out in the sky cause it was glowing like a star, very brightly. i could tell it wasn't a regular aircraft since i see those all the time and this did not have anything in the way of shapes of a conventional aircraft. it's flight patters was a bit unusual so that also told me it was not commercial aircraft.\r\n\r\ni was in shock seeing this mainly because it's during the day in a clear blue sky. it just slowly went straight up into the sky. that's when i lost sight of it. from the distance it was from me i am saying it had to be huge.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

u.S. eastern time zone. i was walking out to my 2006nissan altima at my house on glen road, raymond, maine as i was grabbing work cloths to wash from my car  i noticed a moving light in the sky. at first it was hard to see and then turned off all outside lights off. it was a cloudy night out and the cloud coverage was low. i noticed a half dozen or more fuzzy oval bluish greenish transparent lights moving in a pattern formation in the clouds. they would move very fast some would spin like a ferris wheel and then they would stop suddenly and then change there pattern. the continue for and 1 hour and a half doing 3 or 4 pattern formations. around 21:00 hours or 9:00pm i called 911 dispatch and i was the fourth person to call in reportong the lights. they had cumberland county deputies searching the raymond cape area looking to see where they were coming from. they told me then and again when i followed up the next day that no ground lights caused these lights to appear. at 22:00 hours the lights disappeared just when the clouds started to clear up.I have talked to several neighbors that lived off the cape road in raymond thatnsawmthe lights. i have callex the news three times and they told me they would follow back up with me amd they havent. the cumberland counth sheriffs will only say that they werent ground lights and thats it. i tried calling the maine air national guard in south portland and they wont comment. one more thing while the lights where in the sky i did here a small propellor airplane flying in the clouds heading towards the lights. i couldnt see the plane i could only here it. it flew straight threw and continued on. i know 7 witnesses, but there are more. i tried to fil  the lights but they were to faint to pick up i doo have a 4 second video, but it did make my phone act up and it did the same to two other people that i talked to that witnessed it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was visiting with a friend at my house. we went out to the back yard for a smoke wnd were talking when i noticed a orange light in the sky moving from the eastern sky to the western sky. the light was much brighter than that of a plane and the distance & height seemed to suggest it was moving at a great speed. there were no flashing airplane lights or sound. as we live near a small airport i could tell this wasn't a helicopter or plane. i thought maybe it was a chinese lantern as the light appeared to be fire like & maybe the height was lower than i had thought. the speed of which it traveled convinced me it wasn't. it then took a hard left (south) in the sky and disappeared after a minute. \r\nwe remarked how strange it was and continued our previous conversation. i looked again to the area where it first appeared and a second one was coming. this one appeared almost to be coming right at us. it was even fast than the first and took a slight different flight path. when it too took a hard left and at the point where the light faded i noticed a pyramid shaped group of duller, smaller, white lights travel into it's path and eventually disappear as well.\r\nwe again remarked at how strange this all was when a 3rd fireball started to appear from the same eastern point in the sky and make it's travel path similar to the first. i grabbed my cell phone and began filming. when i was done filming my friend noticed a 5th object above us traveling west or north west. it was a duller, faster light that again disappeared into the horizon.\r\nthe night was clear, cold & there was a very large moon out casting a large halo in the night sky. \r\nthe events took place within 15 minutes from first sighting to last sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

the living room.  she decided to go into garage for a cigarette.  the garage door is usually left open till about 9pm or so when we are home unless the weather is bad or its too cold.  we have a table and chairs set up in there so throughout the evening we make occasional trips to the garage for a smoke or a coffee.  our home is in a subdivision about mid block so we have neighbors surrounding us.  the garage faces north.  my wife went into the garage sat down and once noticed unusual lights in the sky.  she got up walked out into the driveway and observed the lights for several seconds.  she then opened the door to the house and popped her head in and called out me to come quickly outside and have a look.  i would say the entire time she went into the garage until she called for me was no longer than 30 seconds.  \r\n\r\nthe lights were so out of the ordinary that i immediately noticed them.  i observed them for about 15 seconds and then ran inside and got my iphone and ran back out to take video.  at night, our garage is dimly lit.  i use a strand of multicolor christmas lights wrapped around the top of my workbench for illumination.  i keep the overhead garage light off.  being in the garage at night on a regular basis, you get familiar with all the usual lights in the sky.  observing the different types of aircraft in flight are a common occurence. in fact, in the video, you can see a plane moving behind them.  i have never seen anything like them before and they just seemed odd and out of place.  i did not have an idea what the objects were when i first saw them.  i remember asking myself what are they?  then i started mentally going down a checklist as to what they could be.  they were not planes, searchlights, fireworks, fireballs, blimps, or meteors.  i could think of nothing they could have been.  \r\n\r\nthe objects were cylindrical in shape.  this sounds funny but they resembled and moved somewhat like the slinky toy.  they did not seem to be rigid objects.  they were glowing bright and gold in color.  the movement reminded like an eel swimming under water and at the same time, like a leaf, slowly floating down from a tree.  i remember my wife saying that it looked like they had a tail or that it was leaving behind a trail.  the feeling i had after the event was bewilderment.  i just wanted to know what it was we just witnessed.  as you can see from the video, the objects just seemed to fade out.  i stayed in garage for about another hour or so after they faded out but saw nothing out of the ordinary again.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
