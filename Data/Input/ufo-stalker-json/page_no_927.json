(from our nearest cross street of vanowen). within 5 minutes i was on reseda blvd. and when i approached victory blvd., i could see the light off in the distance (about a mile south of me) near the 101 freeway. the light was maybe about 15 degrees above the horizon at that point. it appeared to hover left and right from about 50 feet to the east of reseda blvd. to about the centerline of the street. it would climb and descend randomly and was changing colors every few seconds. as i waited at the bus lane intersection red light by oxnard/reseda, the object seemed to dip lower on its descents than before, to the point where it disappeared from view before reappearing as it ascended again. it would consistently do this on the east side of its loops. it was difficult to tell if it was dipping behind the freeway or some trees to the north of the freeway. at this point, at its apex the object would ascend to maybe 30 degrees above the horizon from my position. given the distance from victory to oxnard and the relative change in the objects position in the sky, i'm sure there is a way to calculate its actual altitude. as i approached hatteras, the object disappeared for the last time and i went ahead past the freeway to see if i could reacquire sight of it, but couldn't find it again. i drove around for maybe another 10 minutes or so around the neighborhood and no trace of it.\r\n\r\ni returned home and my wife and i decided to head back down to the area we had last seen it to see if we could find it again. at this point, maybe an hour had passed since my initial call with her when she had spotted the object. it was basically our first chance to discuss what she had seen and she said it had gotten low enough for her to see it was a huge disc, but too thin for anyone to be onboard. we decided to drive south on reseda to go up the hill south of ventura blvd for a better vantage point. seeing nothing but the normal flight traffic to burbank and van nuys, we headed back down. as we approached ventura blvd heading north on reseda, we saw a massive object with a persistent green light at the center and alternating red lights about 40 feet to either side, which seemed like it was from a plane. this was unusual and caught our attention for three reasons. first, it was extremely low. it approached us from the north straight ahead and banked east over the 101 freeway. we turned east on ventura blvd to follow a parallel path as it wasn't traveling very fast. however, it did occasionally pass behind the buildings along ventura, indicating a very low altitude. secondly, it was silent. i didn't hear any jet or prop noise even though it couldn't have been more than 1500 feet away. we lost it near white oak as it seemed to pick up speed and disappear to the east. the third strange thing about this craft was the color and pattern of its lights. if it were a regular airplane, which we see all the time due to our proximity to burbank and van nuys airports, they should have had a more rapid blink to them. instead, the alternating red lights were on for about a second before switching off. also, a plane at that altitude would be in the process of landing, but no landing lights were on.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

bloomington so i decided to run to cvs real quick. cvs is about a mile or so away from my house and closes at 10pm. i left around 9:50pm, heading east. on my way back home, west, a little more than halfway back, i noticed a bright gold/copper/orange light that was stationary. it was about the level of the tree tops nearby. there were almost no stars present in the sky tonight so i kept my eye on the light. at first site of the light i immediately thought it was a ufo, as i always do. usually i am debunked shortly after a sighting but things were surprisingly different this time. i continued driving towards the light & it disappeared from my view behind the trees for a moment. once i passed these trees, where houses begin along the road, i could see the light again. being closer now, i could see there was more than just one light. at this point i grabbed my phone and called my best friend. i pulled my car into a driveway, now facing north. it was the 3rd or 4th driveway past the trees, about 7 or 8 houses before reaching mine. all of the lights were stationary and were not blinking. there were 4 of them in a diamond formation and were literally almost directly over my car. i couldn't stop staring. i could kind of see a diamond shaped outline and then i noticed another set of 4 lights, in the exact same formation exhibiting the same effects, about 50 feet to the left of the craft above me. these two objects seemed to me, to be way too close to each other to be airplanes or helicopters. i was freaking out to my friend on the phone. i kept telling him i wanted to get out of the car and that i should hangup and take a picture. after getting off the phone i, instead, got scared and didn't feel like i should stay that close any longer. i put my car in reverse and sped down the street, to my house. i ran inside to get my dad. i thought he would want to see what i had just witnessed. we got in the car and i tried to show him but the objects had vanished. we drove around the area for about 10 minutes but only saw a helicopter to the south, moving west. we knew it was a helicopter because of the blue, red, & orange lights and because they were blinking. my dad proceeded to tell me that we don't live in the right area to have ufo sightings, but i have also had two extremely vivid abduction dreams within the past 7 years. this was the most real thing i have experienced. i wish i had known about this site earlier so i could more accurately report these dreams/possible abductions i have experienced. if there are other ufo cases that have occurred in my area i would really like to be informed about them. thank you. i hope this story helps.

as well as numerous other people around here - have been seeing some weird lights in the sky.  \r\n\r\nabout 2 weeks ago, we were on our deck (which faces west) about 7:30 pm and something bright and flashing caught our eye.  we looked through binoculars and whatever it was, it was flashing red-yellow-blue.  we walked up on our hill, and it was moving back and forth - we used a house on another hill to gauge the location.  we tried using the telescope, but no luck.  we were puzzled - and got cold, so we went back in the house.    \r\n\r\na few nights later, we were on our front porch (faces east) about 7:30 -

(that pizza shop has been there for quite some time, yet we have never seen this before.  not to mention that they do not have a \"bat signal\" light on top of their roof - they only have lights around their windows.)  others said that it was a satellite.  (we star gaze sometimes and have seen satellites.  satellites move.  fast.  this did not.)  my cousin said that it could be a star.  (i wouldn't think a star would be in the west, and then just a week later, be at the front of our house at around the same time in the evening!)  i just don't know!  my husband drug our son's telescope down, and he had a heck of a time getting it locked on to the light.  when he finally did, he said that the lights seemed to be in an octagon-ish shape, flashing around the outside.  (i tried to look, but clumsy me bumped the legs and i didn't get to see it.)    \r\n\r\nthat night, when we were going to bed, we noticed the same bright flashing light out of our bathroom window, so we went back outside.  this video that i attached was taken at about 12:30 at night.  there is a house across the road from us, and directly above the house were 3 lights in a vertical line.  there were two of these flashing things on either side of that line.  (i wasn't able to capture both of them in the same frame.)  we were very puzzled about there being two of them!  but once again, we got cold and went back in the house.  \r\n\r\nbut regardless, whatever it is, it's out there again tonight.

avid watcher and know difference between normal and not. this was a life changing experience. i have seen countless craft in past including a near abduction by a triangular craft with a friend in woods when younger. this was like a scene from pearl harbor. i first saw 3 craft appear from over edge of building. i originally had thought it was iss or css. i thought it was weird that they were following each other. i even joked to myself that the chinese were chasing us for secrets. but then i saw the fourth come over the building roof. i was speechless. i didnt notice the other two at first. i was so caught up in the 4 lights. then.................I saw the first wave come over the roof line. i was so scared, i was almost frozen. i only put an estimate of 50 craft in my report, but it may have been 100. there was so many. they were spread over about and covered 40% of the entire horizon. that is when i noticed the other 2 leading craft. they went directly overhead and made a slight change in path to northeast. these 6 craft were leading the pact which were clearly following. the front 6 were about 2 to maybe 3 times as big as the others. normally i see the smaller ones, but they are doing figure 8's and such, these were flying straight, but slightly moving back and forth as if fluid in motion. i would guess they were very high in sky. i cant give good estimate, but i think maybe atleast 30,000 feet. they seemed higher than a jet plane. but i cant be sure. i try to estimate size by using the iss which i see regularly and would say they were like 2/3 size. i was sitting in my car when i saw the first 3 craft. then when i saw the fourth i got out. and i said [item moved/cms/nd] i got out and was walking around in parking lot yelling  [item moved/cms/nd] . there was 2 co workers inside i wanted to run and get, but i was so scared to lose sight of them. i was already late to return but watched then for a few more minutes. the whole event was about 6 minutes.Then i had to go back to work. when i went in the door, they were still going over but they had thinned out. i wouldn't even make report but this was huge and a major event. i have seen a few

the interstate entrance ramp, i noticed a bright object in the sky that seemed to be flying over the interstate. my first thought was of course this was a plane. from a distance it seemed to have a few different colored lights, but it was just unusually bright. i tried to keep my sight on the object as i drove, but as i got closer, the weirder it looked. it no longer looked as if it had multi-colored lights, all i seen was this bright white light. the object also seemed to be only hovering over the highway now and appeared to be changing shapes while it was somehow rotating. at one point it actually looked worm-like. i was struggling to figure out what i was seeing. the scariest part was i think this was somewhat close to the ground, but that also meant the craft itself couldn't have been too big. i estimate it to be the size of a car maybe, i'm not sure. i just know it wasn't as high as a plane would be and this looked nothing at all like one anyways. it felt as if my heart just stopped as i was trying to figure out what this was, to make sense of it before i couldn't see it anymore. now appeared to be triangular or prism shaped, which seemed strange from what i seen earlier. just as i spoke to myself,\"what the hell is that?\", the craft appeared to abruptly turn around. at this point i can definitely see a clear, bright white triangular shape as it starting slowly flying in the opposite direction. it was such a bright white, all over as if it were glowing. there were no blinking lights i should have stopped my car, even on the interstate, but i didn't want to be that close to it honestly. it was right after that it just wasn't in view anymore, it was now behind me as i was driving. i just wish i had a picture or a video. there were other people that were out on the interstate and in the city that had to have seen this as well. i kept checking to see if anyone had filed a report with someone, even with the media. i can't find one, so i'm gonna submit one in hopes of reaching out to someone else that might have seen this or can explain what it was. i'd like to know, i would feel better if there could be some rational explanation.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

summer, all i remember was that it was warm out. i looked out the window of the car and noticed a large bright orb over a field on our way to the store. it looked like a large star, but it couldn't have been, because it was the early evening. it was too large to be a star. i watched it as we drove past, and can recall it wasn't moving. just staying in one spot with no signs of movement. i thought it was really strange when i saw it, because if it was a plane, or even an asteroid, it'd be moving at least a little bit, right? it didn't move at all while i was watching. it was over a year ago, so i don't remember everything, including the exact date and time, although it must have been around 7 pm since my family has dinner at 6 pm, and we went after dinner. i believe it was still there when we were going home less than an hour later, but didn't really catch my attention the second time. still in the same spot.
