barking their warning bark. woke up my son to go check out with me why they were being on alert. when we stepped out of our home one dogs was barking and the other was whimpering. we went around to the back of our home to check looked around with flashlights for some time found nothing ,  the flashlights were really not needed because the moon was shining brightly. when we turned around to check the front yard we realized that  something human like was watching us beside a large cedar tree in my front yard it appeared to blend in with the surrondings some how, the dogs saw it at the same time, he and i did , he is 18 yrs old . we took off after it , when the being moved it disturbed nesting birds in the tree. my son went left and \r\ni went right after circumventing the tree all we found was disturbed grass and impression in it. we stood there dumbfounded for a few minutes trying to figure out what we had just saw. then we went towards the house , to go in . when we did our dogs took off running into back potato field. also i need to add that several dogs in our community were howling as well!!!!! \r\n \r\nnovember 6th 2014 . . as of today we are still having electrical

the border of auburn hills, mi and rochester, mi.\r\nthe group met at the organizers house in auburn hills.\r\nwhen we were heading out to the cars to make half mile journey to our selected field, we noticed the skies were perfectly clear. an excellent night to be star gazing.\r\nit was fairly bright as the moon was overhead and about 70% full.\r\nwe drove to the site, which was only a 1/2 mile or so away.\r\nwe again looked skyward and this time commented on 3 chemtrails being visible.\r\nwe grabbed our chairs and walked a couple hundred feet to the middle of the field and set up our chairs and blankets. that process couldn't have taken more than 15 minutes.\r\nas soon as we were situated, we again looked up, but now there were 15 chemtrails blanketing the sky. the entire sky was nearly completely obscured.\r\ni brought along night vision recording equipment just for the occasion, so i began recording and continued recording most of the time we were out there.\r\nsomewhere about 30 minutes in to the session i saw a triangle craft appear from the north on a southerly trajectory. it was emitting light from each of its 3 corners (as you'll see in the attached video \"auburn hills\"). its altitude seemed to be at least several thousand feet. i called out that i saw an inbound triangle and the guy next to me tried frantically to see what i was talking about. he didn't have any light enhancing devices and never ended up seeing the craft.\r\nwe remained in the field until about 9:15pm when we were collectively too cold to remain much longer. there were no more incidents that were noticed during that time.\r\nthe next day (monday, 11/3/2014) i went through the recordings to show the craft to the others who didn't see it.\r\nthe following day (tuesday, 11/4/2014) i was considering making a story on the chemtrails, so i started looking for a good representative sections to pull from the recordings.\r\ni hadn't reviewed more than 5 minutes of video when i saw what looked like a huge craft moving behind the clouds. i then created a program to step through the frames one at a time so i could see what was going on. it ended up being that what looked like a huge stealth craft was instead 2 more fast moving lights. they came in on parallel trajectories from the top of the video and split off towards the center (as you should be able to see in the attached video \"hidden ufos\"). since i didn't notice the crafts during recording, i panned away earlier than i would have liked had i known they were there. if you step through the frames, you can see the lower craft initiating a hard bank to its left when i'm starting to turn away.\r\n\r\ni returned home at exactly 10:00pm. upon arrival i noticed the skies were perfectly clear, not a single cloud or chemtrail overhead at all. i looked back in the direction of the field we were at and noticed a thick cloud (chemtrail) layer starting around the pontiac area.\r\n\r\nif these had been caused from passenger jet exhaust, the trails would extend across the entire sky. but these were all contained in a tight group blanketing the auburn hills and rochester areas, and likely extended beyond the range i personally witnessed.\r\n\r\ni know it's up to you, the investigator to put the pieces together and nobody is supposed to draw any conclusions, but...\r\ni've spent time on many nights looking at the stars looking for non-ordinary phenomenon. it is a rare occasion to actually see anything at all. when there are 3 craft in two separate encounters within 30 minutes of each other is beyond coincidence. now considering the clouds that were specifically created (being chemtrails) and only over a relatively localized area, and there was a flurry of advanced technology overhead, it is undeniable that the chemtrails were anything but specifically placed there to shield us from seeing what was going on overhead.\r\n\r\ntaking that one step further, what exactly are they filling the atmosphere with (that we all end up having to breath) to support these false cloud banks???\r\n\r\n(here comes the only speculation...)\r\nsince these didn't exhibit out of this world maneuvering capabilities, i am hesitant to say they were of alien manufacture. their speed and triangle shape indicates advanced technology which are within reach of our black projects, so all of this seems likely to be a military coverup of alien technology.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

 when i don't know either.  had another incident where there was a deep deep hum over or around the house,  (this happend before i had my triangle sightig) eventually my tv shut off and my bulldog which was laying at the bottom of my bed  she jumped off bed timidly and when i got up to turn a light on i was in the dark,  i ran into to her standing where i laying facing the back wall,  same wall couple years later that the lights would beam ito room.  she was scared.  then i heard a sound like someone hit the wall behind where the tv is.  no idea what all the other personal experiences boil down too, but i do know what i saw . something else came up when my oldest son came home literally right  after me and my younges son returned home from sighting,  i told my youngest don't tell anyone,  lets not get ridiculed,  but my oldest came in and was excited cause he said he just some kind out of this world fast light shooting in the sky , so my son and i told him what we had just saw ourselves   not sure if its the same object.  had i not seen what i saw,  i would have thought he just saw a shooting star. but since we had just saw what we saw,  i can't be sure what my oldest saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":61220,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.105017,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11062014-0006","longitude":-81.792132,"occurred":1297395000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1415288268000,"summary":"Black perfect triangle three white lights and one red light in middle beaming down ,  i was driving home with my son  just after dark   he saw it too.  he was bothered more emotionally than i    i was thrilled to see it,  he wasn't. it scared him.","tags":["triangle","lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1364,"locationName":"Middleburg, Florida","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:86187"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Hamilton Township","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Plane was a little loud and at a medium distance from me. close enough for me the see two small 'wings' at the nose area and close enough to distinguish what was apparently twin jet engines.  perhaps nothing unusual, but it was not something i recall having seen in the past.

proceeding north. it was a bright sunny day with only a few cumulus clouds in the sky. abruptly to the northwest at about 35-degrees off the horizon, a moving object about the size of a beebee at arms length caught my eye. it was mostly whitish with a silvery center that seemed to glow. i presumed it was an aircraft that was reflecting the bright sunlight that was behind me. however, the object never changed shape in appearance as it traveled north-to-northeast in level flight with no contrail. the object continued to appear round and whitish in color with a highly reflective center that seemed silvery. i stood still to watch it for about 2-minutes until it disappeared behind a tree line. at all times it flew above the few clouds that were in the sky and there were no other aircraft in my view. air temperature at ground level was in the 50s at that time of day and winds were under 10 mph out of the northeast that morning. i'd estimate that the object's distance from me would be over a mile since it was further away than the nearest clouds which were about a half-mile from me to the northwest. what struck me as odd or unusual about the object was that it never changed it's apparent round shape or coloring. over the next few days i made a point of observing aircraft in the sky and it was apparent to me that they significantly change their apparent shape and the amount of light they reflect when they are at altitude and flying in bright sunlight.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was 11 - 12 at night. my cousin and i were parked by the van cortlandt park woods in front of his house on a dead end street when i noticed a light source coming from deep inside the woods. i took a few steps towards the gate that separated us from the woods and our parking spot. my first thought was that of an image of the eiffel tower (red exterior lights on the pointy top hovering over an orange beam.) we walk these woods all the time and we can tell you that there has never been light illuminating from inside. when you walk inside the woods, its steep downhill, but what we saw was directly at eye level, so we could only assume it was treetop. the orange beam seemed to give off an energy that would not allow my cousin and i to look away. it demanded our attention as it was the most beautiful light show we've ever seen. we were speechless. at that moment my cousin started walking closer to the gate. the closer he got to the gate and stepped on the leaves, lights changed from blue to orange to finally red. at that point we were already leaning on the gate to get a closer look. the harder we looked and tried to focus on the object the more it appeared to move closer. it moved to a point where we can see a red glare giving off from the exterior red light. the exterior red light paused from there on after. we stood there in awe. the lights had a different affect on me than they did my cousin. whatever it was, it was trying to alter what i was seeing. it was throwing different images at me and i felt like a negative energy was telling me to go away. then suddenly out of nowhere we heard a humming sound coming from that direction. we knew without a doubt it came from what we were looking at. nothing else was around and it was one of the quietest nights we've ever had near these woods. what we saw next could only be described as an indent coming from the middle of the beam. it was absorbing something slowly. we couldn't believe what we were looking at. it was like something out of the comic books. and as cliche as that sounds, bear with us, because things start to get even weirder. we start hearing footsteps running. it was approximately 15 to 20 feet away from us and gaining. we were scared to death at this point. it felt like spirits were telling us to go away. as it started to get closer it ran through our peripheral. what we saw can only be described as it appearing to be human wearing a cloaking device. their might have been more than one as the footsteps could be heard moving from the left and from the right of us. we felt them telling us to go away. its hard to explain but the shock of it all flustered our feelings and made us feel like we were invading. at this point we moved closer to our parked car which was not far from the gate. as soon as that happened something ran inside the neighbors' backyard finding an entrance through the woods. the minute the gate closed behind whatever it was, the neighbor's backyard light and inside car lights flickered on for just a second. we heard the neighbors' back door open very quietly gentle and footsteps in the house like sharp tip toeing for maybe about 10 steps as it was all done in one quick motion as if what ever it was was powered by energy and that's what flickered all the lights. it was amazing!!! like a surge of energy from a higher being triggering everything electrical around it. as if it was in the power lines! we freaked out! it left the house promptly after the footsteps and closed the door behind it again very gently and closed the gate heading back towards the woods. my cousin ran to wake up my other friend who lived in the same house as him. we needed another eye witness to make sure what we were seeing wasn't at all in our heads. we failed to bring him due to his heavy sleeping, and work in the morning status. my cousin finally came back with the bad news and by that time the footsteps were far but could be heard from a distance. my cousin climbed on the rail to lean on the gate to once again get a closer look at the object, two large stomps approached him very aggressively but yet subtly shaking the gate. he quickly jumped off in fear. we just sat there in disbelief! we couldn't believe that something like this was happening to us. we felt alone in this world even though something out of this world was just a few yards away. if you already don't believe us than you'll believe us even less when we tell you someone star like came out of this craft and started walking around. its physical form was that of a man but glowing like the sun. no eyes or mouth could be seen but he was just like a bright star! the beam widened up and then it slimmed down again. like as if it sucked him up. that was the last we saw of whatever that was. i had to pick up my mother from work soon so i had to leave, regrettably. my cousin went to sleep and neither one of us saw the craft fly off. we only we wish would've recorded whatever we saw but it was too dark for my iphone to capture anything inside these woods. we're trusting our eyes, mind and body that what we saw that night of november 3, 2014 was not a hoax but a real event that changed the view of the world for my cousin and i. \r\n\r\n\r\nthank

hear a low rumbling noise that began to slowly get louder. at first being near baton rouge with our chemical plants, i thought the noise was the plant kicking up their flame stacks to burn more chemicals. sometimes at night they do this and you can hear it for about 30 minutes to an hour. i walked out to get a better idea of which direction it was coming from and immediately noticed a group of flashing lights in the sky. i knew this couldn't be airplanes flashing in the distance because of first off the lights were in a triangle shape and they were all the same distance from me. also the lights were flashing in sequential order from left to right in perfect timing. i watched as the sound got louder and then noticed they were all moving together towards northwest from original location i spotted it in. the lights lead me to believe instead of 5 different objects, this was one very large object. as large as maybe half of my town of zachary louisiana. roughly 4 miles across. as it moved away i ran and woke my mother to have a second witness. my mom does not believe in ufos and she was also convinced it was one large triangle. as it got further away the rumbling stopped and also the front light became solid and stayed on until no lights were visible. i would love to know if anything was reported on radar being i live near baton rouge airport. this also means i am used to flashing lights from planes and also study passing satellites and orbiting rocket bodies using a sky monitoring app for satellites in the sky. lots of cloud cover tonight but clouds were very high. i did not see any single planes tonight though. these were the only lights. i always see strange objects because i watch the skys. i have seen more than one anomalies in the same direction from my front yard. but this was the first ever hearing anything and first triangle craft or at least formation.","distance":"Over One

get my mail. when i started to walk back to my apartment, i felt an urge to look up in the sky. i did so, and immediately noticed a small white orb moving slowly high in the sky from east to west. it appeared to be going in a straight line. it made no noise and there was no smoke. it was a partly cloudy day, and i stared at the object as it moved closer toward the blazing sun light. one thing that is interesting about this sight, is that i was in a location where a neighbor once told me that he has seen flying rods at night. my reaction to this site was incredible. i immediately started doing research on flying orbs. something within myself tells me that this object was not man-made. it's almost as if a consciousness beckoned me to look up at the right time. i was so changed by this experience, that i have decided to purchase a good video camera.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1
