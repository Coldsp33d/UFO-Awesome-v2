approximately 7:22-7:26 pm est. it began while the witness was standing in the back yard photographing astronomical objects. thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain ufos, because when it happened the witness was photographing venus, mars, saturn, and the moon and the witness labeled them on some of the photographs. the witness is an amateur astronomer, has worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, the witness had two cameras with me. the cameras were an iphone 6s and a hidef camcorder that also records sound. the witness has made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. everything the witness saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.\r\nit started when the witness was looking southwest at venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. they flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. there were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. the object’s lights didn’t blink or change in intensity or brightness. the movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. from this first second of the sighting, the witness was mystified.\r\nthey approached venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, the witness thought they had to be connected. the witness watched for what would happen when they would pass venus. they were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. when they went by venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full moon's apparent diameter above venus and the lower one about the same distance below venus–the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with venus in the middle. they moved so synchronously that the witness expected them to be connected. although the witness couldn’t see any connection, the witness thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.\r\nbut when they passed by venus, the witness saw no dimming, so the witness didn't know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn’t show up much when they flew past venus). they didn’t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. they looked nothing like chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.\r\nthey flew in a controlled fashion–they stayed in a vertical position. the witness didn’t know how they flew–and didn’t hear engine noises but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. the witness was amazed because they looked like something that couldn’t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, the witness thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. the witness don’t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.\r\nthe witness had been taking photos of the planets with the iphone in hand when the witness saw them. but the witness was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that the witness didn’t do anything except stand there frozen. when the brain finally re-activated, the witness realized the witness needed to take photos so the witness took pictures–snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 est each 5 seconds after the previous one. this was after the red objects had already passed. the witness think the witness didn’t see anything when the witness took these photos. \r\nthen the witness noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. this display took up a large area of the sky–maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. it spread from the tree to the southeast to west of venus, which was to the west. \r\nbecause the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, the witness ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion.  it took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. it was mounted on a tripod. by the time, the witness had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so the witness couldn’t see them. the witness thought the tail end of the objects was still there. the witness pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. when the witness had seen them by eye they appeared to flash, move around–sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. all this was soundless. there seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. these were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. the witness took a 26-second video (although that doesn’t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).\r\nthe size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. a low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at john glenn columbus international airport–about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the moon or smaller. the size of the moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. it shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. the car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. if the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.\r\nthere was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. this is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around.  the neighbors are the relatives and the witness knew what they are doing. the witness is very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.\r\nthese objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. the sighting was nothing like viewing a drone–the witness has a drone, flies it, photographs with it, and repairs it, so the witness is familiar with drones. the objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). what the witness saw were bodies against the sky. it was nothing like fireworks. the witness has recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. this was nothing like chinese lanterns–several chinese lanterns have landed in the field the witness filmed in and has them. they weren’t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don’t light up at night. the witness saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. the witness read that all aircraft built after march 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. there was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft–just white flashes at random all over the sky. in addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object’s blinking. \r\nthe white flashing objects were nothing like stars. when one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. but they do not completely disappear and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. the stars and planets have stable locations. thus, the phenomenon wasn’t photographs of stars or twinkling. both cameras can photograph stars at night. also the witness had seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. the witness has also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out–the witness may even have one that the witness collected here years ago. these last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.\r\nthe camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when the witness rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.\r\nthe witness wasn’t sure about the colors–whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. the objects blinked in random patterns–nothing like an airplane. \r\nthe objects the witness watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, the witness had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. in the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what the witness captured of these were flashes. occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.\r\nafter the witness recorded the views, the iphone and camcorder were taken into the house and the witness e-mailed the camera photos to the computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. the witness still has the original e-mails and camcorder tape. there was a game going on at the school several miles to the west and so the witness contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. the answer was no, and the witness didn’t think so to begin with but checked anyway.  later the witness called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. they said no, and suggested calling the bigelow organization that collects ufo information. they returned the call several days later, but the witness didn’t get back to them. the witness immediately on november 4 posted the video both on youtube and facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but the witness didn’t find out anything. the original november 4 youtube videos and other posts are still on.\r\nthe witness also checked the weather which said: “wind    \r\nwind speed     4 mph (north)              \r\nmax wind speed         14 mph           \r\nmax gust speed 17 mph           \r\nvisibility       8 miles and from the north at 7: 51”\r\nthe wind was blowing from north to south. the objects traveled from west to east. if the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power. \r\nbecause this was the backyard, the witness has taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. for example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don’t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. these other videos don’t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.\r\nimmediately after the witness made the photography, the witness wondered if  anything had been photographed, because this was difficult photography. it was dark, which made it difficult to use the iphone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. but when the witness uploaded everything to the computer, the witness was amazed that everything had worked–the cameras had come on instantly and in focus. \r\nthe witness had taken three photos by iphone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. these three turned out well and although the witness thought the witness had photographed nothing because the witness did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and the witness didn’t see anything when t the photographs were taken, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera. \r\nthe videotape also turned out much better than the witness expected. the witness might have seen a few flashes when the witness made the video, but the actual video showed much more. when the witness clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. the witness had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashes.\r\n\r\nwhen the witness uploaded the three photographs into the computer, the witness noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. they were generally to the east of venus. although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).\r\nin order to check whether the spots were in the same place, the witness made computer transparencies and overlaid them. this showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.\r\nin order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, the witness looked at the photos that were taken right before the witness saw the two red objects. there were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. thus, the spots didn’t appear to be part of the natural background. they also wouldn’t be some form of camera artifact.\r\nwith this camera, the witness can easily photograph such objects as mars and saturn and has even photographed dimmer objects such as neptune and asteroids, so the witness was familiar with the camera’s performance. the stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. the witness saw no airplanes at the time the witness took the photographs and the witness would have noticed them because the witness was looking at venus. moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and the witness would definitely have noticed. the only things the witness had seen near venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before the witness took the photographs. also, the witness doubt if the camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. the objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as mars. the trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. in addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don’t more around.\r\nalthough the only objects the witness saw were the two red ones, it appeared that the witness had photographed several other things. because the witness had seen the red objects by eye, the witness thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. the witness think they weren’t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots the witness photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.\r\nthus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after the witness saw the two red ones. the witness didn’t see these when the witness took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.\r\nthese spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as mars had photographed. the witness thought if birds had photographed they would have appeared dark. thus, the witness thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.\r\nthe witness quit photographing with the iphone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and the witness ran to the video camera. this also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects the witness had seen before this were the two red ones. also, all the witness saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; the witness assumed the flashes were from objects that weren’t visible in the dark. thus, perhaps the spots the witness saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed venus.\r\nthis photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but the witness may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.\r\nperhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that ufos will suddenly blink out or disappear.\r\n\r\nthe witness was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. the witness was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.\r\nthe video definitely showed some of the object’s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. it also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer ones \r\nthe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. these were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have been other colors that just didn’t photograph). these objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. the first two red objects that the witness had seen with by eye shone a very bright red–sort of a blood red color. two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. however, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing. \r\nthe white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (the photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. the neighbors were relatives and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).\r\nthe witness had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. although the witness didn’t see this with by eye when the witness took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while–the video captured them three times. the witness don’t know if these red objects were the same ones the witness saw with by eye at the beginning when they passed venus. there were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and the witness don’t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. the witness had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in the original observation by eyesight but don’t know if these were what the witness was seeing in the video. sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. the witness don’t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. the witness had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).\r\nthe video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. the witness don’t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two the witness saw with by eye (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed venus). these were not vertical as the ones the witness saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. these two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. the two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. if these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.\r\nthe witness saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.\r\nat other times, the witness would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. the witness couldn’t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. sometimes the witness would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. the witness also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. there seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. the witness don’t know if there were other colors. \r\nthe red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. in airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. the first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. and the time between views was less for the last one also. the distance between the red objects varied. thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft. \r\nother oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. their blinking pattern wasn’t regular. also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. they might have been traveling upward after they had passed at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. if aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. these appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn’t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. and if these were the lighting on a craft, the witness should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. but the witness didn’t see them again–they slowed only three times. \r\nin comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did. \r\nthese were nothing like strobe lights. although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. there was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. in comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. these white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. their strobbing wasn’t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.\r\nthere were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. the witness didn’t remember from seeing them with by eye if there were other colors. in general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly. \r\nno object’s flashes were recorded in exactly the same place, so the witness photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. \r\nthere was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. in several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. the planets never appeared as double. some of the object’s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. sometimes ufos are reported as merging or coming apart. these double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.\r\nthere were several indications that these objects had some form of power. one reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. the ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. also, they glowed and this glowing would take power. in addition, they were able to blink off and on. blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. the ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects. \r\n\r\nduring the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. the first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. venus and the moon are a distance apart. venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn’t really move). a number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.\r\nbecause this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. for example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. a close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the moon. the display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the moon.\r\nthese object’s flashes could also be compared to the general background. the witness took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. the background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. the objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches. \r\nbecause the background isn’t white, the witness thought most of the white flashes are from objects. unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. the red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. however, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. an instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. at 00.08  – - 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. but as they continued, they became less well defined. at 00:10 – -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. on their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. then they disappeared and didn’t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. perhaps they had sped off. \r\nthe white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. they often would appear for only one click. because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn’t be seen. \r\nthe bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. however, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. if these objects were some kind of camera artifacts, the objects would be visible on both sides. (when the witness had first seen the display it was to the west of venus and heading east and then the flashing objects covered a wide area of the sky but they were drifting to the east and by the time the witness had the camcorder on, the witness was just photographing the tail end of the group. when the witness took the video, the witness thought it might be too late to get anything, but the witness did photograph some of it.) thus, because the flashing was mainly on the left side of the video, the right side might be used as a sort of control for how the normal sky would appear. the witness has many videos that could be compared to this one and used as controls.\r\nthe video began with a wide-angle exposure. a white light appeared at 00:00 – -00.25. it was below the moon and to the left of venus. because the camcorder was recording at the wide angle setting and shows both the moon, venus, and silhouettes of the trees, it demonstrations that even at this stage (as the group of objects flew east) that objects could appear far enough west to show that the display took up a considerable angular distance. \r\ntwo (or maybe 3) white objects appeared at 00:02 – -00:23, then more flashes appeared. increased activity begins at about 00:07. one of several double appearing white blinks occurred at 00:08 – -00:17, another was at  (00:08 – -00.07), and another at  00:015– -00:10. these may be two white lights that are near each other when they flashed.  one white object flashed twice in about the same location (00:16 – -00.09 and 6 clicks later also at  00:16 – -00.09).  at 00:11 – -00.14 four fairly dim white objects flashed; two of these were quite close together. \r\nat 00:13 – -00.12, a white object appears in a wide view above a tree silhouette, and 3 clicks later another white object appears to its right and some distance away compared to the tree silhouette. nothing was visible during further clicks. one trailing, dim white object appeared to show on the right side as late as 00:19 – -00.06.\r\nthe first two red objects appeared at 00:07 – -00.18, they then continue to appear together through 8 clicks until the furthest left one blinked out at  (still at 00:07 – -00.18), then another one appeared below the former position of the left one (still at 00:07 – -00.18). after that two red objects appeared together again at (00:07 – -00.17), and then after another click a third red object appeared ((00:07 – -00.17). the two red objects appeared together again at 00.09 – -00.16. sometimes a red object would appear by itself such as at 00:09 – - 00.16. at 00:08 – -00.17 two red objects that have stayed together are visible, in one click the one on the left becomes fainter and sort of appears as if it is moving down, in the next click a red object appears under the right red object that is still on, as if the left object moved to the right and under the right object which stayed lit. because several red objects sometimes came on together, possibly they were lights on a larger craft. sometimes they would form a triangle.\r\nboth white and red objects sometimes appeared to have trails, for example white one at 00:03 – -00.22. \r\nthese red objects were sharp, but others sometimes appeared that were less sharp and the witness didn’t know if these were just photographic artifacts, or objects with dimmer lights, or red objects in motion. some of the white flashes were much clearer and more distinct than others. when the witness am recording stars or airplanes with this camera after dark, the witness see no flashing objects like this, so they weren’t camera artifacts. the main time there are camera artifacts on this camera’s videos is when the battery is low. these artifacts are normally rectangular-shaped and sometimes they contain colors or designs. they aren’t flashing objects like these. \r\nthe witness posted this video on youtube on that day and has posted more several more times. because one could see a lot less on youtube than on the hidef video, the witness just posted several slowed down, enhancements of the video to show what some of the blinking objects looked like and a general view. the witness also tried adding a hidef video, but the youtube ones didn’t have enough pixels to show much and the witness received no comments. \r\nthe witness thought the iphone was pointing in the general area of the southwest when the witness took the photos and the photos were in full high definition. \r\nthe camcorder was mounted on a tripod and pointing south. it was a sony hdr-hc5 hdv 1080 4mp minidv hi with 10x optical zoom and digital zoom. the recording was made in 1080p full high-definition video on dv cassette tape. the camera has night vision, but the witness had it set for day vision, so the witness could see the color of the planets. the video was transferred to an imac computer using imovie. the video is large, 425 mb, and the witness did not know how to send it. the youtube video upload shows much less than the actual video. \r\nthe witness has the original photographs that were sent from the iphone tothe computer and the tracking information. the witness thinks the gps had been turned off. \r\nthe photo’s exif data existed. this worked and the witness was able to extract the digital information from the photographs, as shown below:\r\nthe witness used the internet program “camerasummary.Coms” to extract the exif information. the photographs that had originally mailed to the computer provided a complete exif. \r\nthis worked and i was able to extract the digital information from the photographs, as shown below:\r\ni used the internet program https://camerasummary.Coms to extract the exif information and that for the first iphone

objects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sighting, november 4, 2016, took place at approximately 7:22-7:26 pm est. it began while the witness was standing in the back yard photographing astronomical objects. thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain ufos, because when it happened the witness was photographing venus, mars, saturn, and the moon and the witness labeled them on some of the photographs. the witness is an amateur astronomer, has worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, the witness had two cameras with me. the cameras were an iphone 6s and a hidef camcorder that also records sound. the witness has made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. everything the witness saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.\r\nit started when the witness was looking southwest at venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. they flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. there were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. the object’s lights didn’t blink or change in intensity or brightness. the movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. from this first second of the sighting, the witness was mystified.\r\nthey approached venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, the witness thought they had to be connected. the witness watched for what would happen when they would pass venus. they were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. when they went by venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full moon's apparent diameter above venus and the lower one about the same distance below venus–the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with venus in the middle. they moved so synchronously that the witness expected them to be connected. although the witness couldn’t see any connection, the witness thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.\r\nbut when they passed by venus, the witness saw no dimming, so the witness didn't know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn’t show up much when they flew past venus). they didn’t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. they looked nothing like chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.\r\nthey flew in a controlled fashion–they stayed in a vertical position. the witness didn’t know how they flew–and didn’t hear engine noises but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. the witness was amazed because they looked like something that couldn’t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, the witness thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. the witness don’t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.\r\nthe witness had been taking photos of the planets with the iphone in hand when the witness saw them. but the witness was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that the witness didn’t do anything except stand there frozen. when the brain finally re-activated, the witness realized the witness needed to take photos so the witness took pictures–snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 est each 5 seconds after the previous one. this was after the red objects had already passed. the witness think the witness didn’t see anything when the witness took these photos. \r\nthen the witness noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. this display took up a large area of the sky–maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. it spread from the tree to the southeast to west of venus, which was to the west. \r\nbecause the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, the witness ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion.  it took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. it was mounted on a tripod. by the time, the witness had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so the witness couldn’t see them. the witness thought the tail end of the objects was still there. the witness pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. when the witness had seen them by eye they appeared to flash, move around–sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. all this was soundless. there seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. these were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. the witness took a 26-second video (although that doesn’t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).\r\nthe size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. a low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at john glenn columbus international airport–about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the moon or smaller. the size of the moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. it shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. the car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. if the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.\r\nthere was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. this is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around.  the neighbors are the relatives and the witness knew what they are doing. the witness is very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.\r\nthese objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. the sighting was nothing like viewing a drone–the witness has a drone, flies it, photographs with it, and repairs it, so the witness is familiar with drones. the objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). what the witness saw were bodies against the sky. it was nothing like fireworks. the witness has recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. this was nothing like chinese lanterns–several chinese lanterns have landed in the field the witness filmed in and has them. they weren’t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don’t light up at night. the witness saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. the witness read that all aircraft built after march 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. there was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft–just white flashes at random all over the sky. in addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object’s blinking. \r\nthe white flashing objects were nothing like stars. when one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. but they do not completely disappear and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. the stars and planets have stable locations. thus, the phenomenon wasn’t photographs of stars or twinkling. both cameras can photograph stars at night. also the witness had seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. the witness has also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out–the witness may even have one that the witness collected here years ago. these last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.\r\nthe camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when the witness rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.\r\nthe witness wasn’t sure about the colors–whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. the objects blinked in random patterns–nothing like an airplane. \r\nthe objects the witness watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, the witness had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. in the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what the witness captured of these were flashes. occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.\r\nafter the witness recorded the views, the iphone and camcorder were taken into the house and the witness e-mailed the camera photos to the computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. the witness still has the original e-mails and camcorder tape. there was a game going on at the school several miles to the west and so the witness contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. the answer was no, and the witness didn’t think so to begin with but checked anyway.  later the witness called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. they said no, and suggested calling the bigelow organization that collects ufo information. they returned the call several days later, but the witness didn’t get back to them. the witness immediately on november 4 posted the video both on youtube and facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but the witness didn’t find out anything. the original november 4 youtube videos and other posts are still on.\r\nthe witness also checked the weather which said: “wind    \r\nwind speed     4 mph (north)              \r\nmax wind speed         14 mph           \r\nmax gust speed 17 mph           \r\nvisibility       8 miles and from the north at 7: 51”\r\nthe wind was blowing from north to south. the objects traveled from west to east. if the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power. \r\nbecause this was the backyard, the witness has taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. for example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don’t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. these other videos don’t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.\r\nimmediately after the witness made the photography, the witness wondered if  anything had been photographed, because this was difficult photography. it was dark, which made it difficult to use the iphone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. but when the witness uploaded everything to the computer, the witness was amazed that everything had worked–the cameras had come on instantly and in focus. \r\nthe witness had taken three photos by iphone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. these three turned out well and although the witness thought the witness had photographed nothing because the witness did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and the witness didn’t see anything when t the photographs were taken, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera. \r\nthe videotape also turned out much better than the witness expected. the witness might have seen a few flashes when the witness made the video, but the actual video showed much more. when the witness clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. the witness had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashes.\r\n\r\nwhen the witness uploaded the three photographs into the computer, the witness noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. they were generally to the east of venus. although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).\r\nin order to check whether the spots were in the same place, the witness made computer transparencies and overlaid them. this showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.\r\nin order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, the witness looked at the photos that were taken right before the witness saw the two red objects. there were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. thus, the spots didn’t appear to be part of the natural background. they also wouldn’t be some form of camera artifact.\r\nwith this camera, the witness can easily photograph such objects as mars and saturn and has even photographed dimmer objects such as neptune and asteroids, so the witness was familiar with the camera’s performance. the stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. the witness saw no airplanes at the time the witness took the photographs and the witness would have noticed them because the witness was looking at venus. moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and the witness would definitely have noticed. the only things the witness had seen near venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before the witness took the photographs. also, the witness doubt if the camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. the objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as mars. the trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. in addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don’t more around.\r\nalthough the only objects the witness saw were the two red ones, it appeared that the witness had photographed several other things. because the witness had seen the red objects by eye, the witness thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. the witness think they weren’t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots the witness photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.\r\nthus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after the witness saw the two red ones. the witness didn’t see these when the witness took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.\r\nthese spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as mars had photographed. the witness thought if birds had photographed they would have appeared dark. thus, the witness thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.\r\nthe witness quit photographing with the iphone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and the witness ran to the video camera. this also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects the witness had seen before this were the two red ones. also, all the witness saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; the witness assumed the flashes were from objects that weren’t visible in the dark. thus, perhaps the spots the witness saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed venus.\r\nthis photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but the witness may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.\r\nperhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that ufos will suddenly blink out or disappear.\r\n\r\nthe witness was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. the witness was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.\r\nthe video definitely showed some of the object’s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. it also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer ones \r\nthe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. these were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have been other colors that just didn’t photograph). these objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. the first two red objects that the witness had seen with by eye shone a very bright red–sort of a blood red color. two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. however, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing. \r\nthe white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (the photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. the neighbors were relatives and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).\r\nthe witness had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. although the witness didn’t see this with by eye when the witness took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while–the video captured them three times. the witness don’t know if these red objects were the same ones the witness saw with by eye at the beginning when they passed venus. there were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and the witness don’t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. the witness had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in the original observation by eyesight but don’t know if these were what the witness was seeing in the video. sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. the witness don’t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. the witness had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).\r\nthe video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. the witness don’t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two the witness saw with by eye (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed venus). these were not vertical as the ones the witness saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. these two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. the two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. if these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.\r\nthe witness saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.\r\nat other times, the witness would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. the witness couldn’t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. sometimes the witness would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. the witness also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. there seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. the witness don’t know if there were other colors. \r\nthe red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. in airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. the first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. and the time between views was less for the last one also. the distance between the red objects varied. thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft. \r\nother oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. their blinking pattern wasn’t regular. also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. they might have been traveling upward after they had passed at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. if aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. these appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn’t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. and if these were the lighting on a craft, the witness should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. but the witness didn’t see them again–they slowed only three times. \r\nin comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did. \r\nthese were nothing like strobe lights. although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. there was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. in comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. these white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. their strobbing wasn’t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.\r\nthere were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. the witness didn’t remember from seeing them with by eye if there were other colors. in general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly. \r\nno object’s flashes were recorded in exactly the same place, so the witness photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. \r\nthere was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. in several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. the planets never appeared as double. some of the object’s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. sometimes ufos are reported as merging or coming apart. these double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.\r\nthere were several indications that these objects had some form of power. one reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. the ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. also, they glowed and this glowing would take power. in addition, they were able to blink off and on. blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. the ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects. \r\n\r\nduring the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. the first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. venus and the moon are a distance apart. venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn’t really move). a number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.\r\nbecause this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. for example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. a close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the moon. the display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the moon.\r\nthese object’s flashes could also be compared to the general background. the witness took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. the background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. the objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches. \r\nbecause the background isn’t white, the witness thought most of the white flashes are from objects. unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. the red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. however, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. an instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. at 00.08  – - 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. but as they continued, they became less well defined. at 00:10 – -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. on their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. then they disappeared and didn’t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. perhaps they had sped off. \r\nthe white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. they often would appear for only one click. because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn’t be seen. \r\nthe bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. however, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. if these objects were some

approximately 7:22-7:26 pm est. it began while the witness was standing in the back yard photographing astronomical objects. thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain ufos, because when it happened the witness was photographing venus, mars, saturn, and the moon and the witness labeled them on some of the photographs. the witness is an amateur astronomer, has worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, the witness had two cameras with me. the cameras were an iphone 6s and a hidef camcorder that also records sound. the witness has made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. everything the witness saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.\r\nit started when the witness was looking southwest at venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. they flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. there were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. the object’s lights didn’t blink or change in intensity or brightness. the movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. from this first second of the sighting, the witness was mystified.\r\nthey approached venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, the witness thought they had to be connected. the witness watched for what would happen when they would pass venus. they were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. when they went by venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full moon's apparent diameter above venus and the lower one about the same distance below venus–the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with venus in the middle. they moved so synchronously that the witness expected them to be connected. although the witness couldn’t see any connection, the witness thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.\r\nbut when they passed by venus, the witness saw no dimming, so the witness didn't know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn’t show up much when they flew past venus). they didn’t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. they looked nothing like chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.\r\nthey flew in a controlled fashion–they stayed in a vertical position. the witness didn’t know how they flew–and didn’t hear engine noises but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. the witness was amazed because they looked like something that couldn’t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, the witness thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. the witness don’t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.\r\nthe witness had been taking photos of the planets with the iphone in hand when the witness saw them. but the witness was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that the witness didn’t do anything except stand there frozen. when the brain finally re-activated, the witness realized the witness needed to take photos so the witness took pictures–snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 est each 5 seconds after the previous one. this was after the red objects had already passed. the witness think the witness didn’t see anything when the witness took these photos. \r\nthen the witness noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. this display took up a large area of the sky–maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. it spread from the tree to the southeast to west of venus, which was to the west. \r\nbecause the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, the witness ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion.  it took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. it was mounted on a tripod. by the time, the witness had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so the witness couldn’t see them. the witness thought the tail end of the objects was still there. the witness pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. when the witness had seen them by eye they appeared to flash, move around–sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. all this was soundless. there seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. these were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. the witness took a 26-second video (although that doesn’t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).\r\nthe size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. a low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at john glenn columbus international airport–about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the moon or smaller. the size of the moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. it shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. the car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. if the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.\r\nthere was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. this is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around.  the neighbors are the relatives and the witness knew what they are doing. the witness is very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.\r\nthese objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. the sighting was nothing like viewing a drone–the witness has a drone, flies it, photographs with it, and repairs it, so the witness is familiar with drones. the objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). what the witness saw were bodies against the sky. it was nothing like fireworks. the witness has recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. this was nothing like chinese lanterns–several chinese lanterns have landed in the field the witness filmed in and has them. they weren’t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don’t light up at night. the witness saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. the witness read that all aircraft built after march 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. there was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft–just white flashes at random all over the sky. in addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object’s blinking. \r\nthe white flashing objects were nothing like stars. when one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. but they do not completely disappear and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. the stars and planets have stable locations. thus, the phenomenon wasn’t photographs of stars or twinkling. both cameras can photograph stars at night. also the witness had seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. the witness has also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out–the witness may even have one that the witness collected here years ago. these last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.\r\nthe camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when the witness rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.\r\nthe witness wasn’t sure about the colors–whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. the objects blinked in random patterns–nothing like an airplane. \r\nthe objects the witness watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, the witness had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. in the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what the witness captured of these were flashes. occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.\r\nafter the witness recorded the views, the iphone and camcorder were taken into the house and the witness e-mailed the camera photos to the computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. the witness still has the original e-mails and camcorder tape. there was a game going on at the school several miles to the west and so the witness contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. the answer was no, and the witness didn’t think so to begin with but checked anyway.  later the witness called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. they said no, and suggested calling the bigelow organization that collects ufo information. they returned the call several days later, but the witness didn’t get back to them. the witness immediately on november 4 posted the video both on youtube and facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but the witness didn’t find out anything. the original november 4 youtube videos and other posts are still on.\r\nthe witness also checked the weather which said: “wind    \r\nwind speed     4 mph (north)              \r\nmax wind speed         14 mph           \r\nmax gust speed 17 mph           \r\nvisibility       8 miles and from the north at 7: 51”\r\nthe wind was blowing from north to south. the objects traveled from west to east. if the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power. \r\nbecause this was the backyard, the witness has taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. for example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don’t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. these other videos don’t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.\r\nimmediately after the witness made the photography, the witness wondered if  anything had been photographed, because this was difficult photography. it was dark, which made it difficult to use the iphone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. but when the witness uploaded everything to the computer, the witness was amazed that everything had worked–the cameras had come on instantly and in focus. \r\nthe witness had taken three photos by iphone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. these three turned out well and although the witness thought the witness had photographed nothing because the witness did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and the witness didn’t see anything when t the photographs were taken, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera. \r\nthe videotape also turned out much better than the witness expected. the witness might have seen a few flashes when the witness made the video, but the actual video showed much more. when the witness clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. the witness had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashes.\r\n\r\nwhen the witness uploaded the three photographs into the computer, the witness noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. they were generally to the east of venus. although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).\r\nin order to check whether the spots were in the same place, the witness made computer transparencies and overlaid them. this showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.\r\nin order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, the witness looked at the photos that were taken right before the witness saw the two red objects. there were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. thus, the spots didn’t appear to be part of the natural background. they also wouldn’t be some form of camera artifact.\r\nwith this camera, the witness can easily photograph such objects as mars and saturn and has even photographed dimmer objects such as neptune and asteroids, so the witness was familiar with the camera’s performance. the stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. the witness saw no airplanes at the time the witness took the photographs and the witness would have noticed them because the witness was looking at venus. moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and the witness would definitely have noticed. the only things the witness had seen near venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before the witness took the photographs. also, the witness doubt if the camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. the objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as mars. the trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. in addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don’t more around.\r\nalthough the only objects the witness saw were the two red ones, it appeared that the witness had photographed several other things. because the witness had seen the red objects by eye, the witness thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. the witness think they weren’t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots the witness photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.\r\nthus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after the witness saw the two red ones. the witness didn’t see these when the witness took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.\r\nthese spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as mars had photographed. the witness thought if birds had photographed they would have appeared dark. thus, the witness thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.\r\nthe witness quit photographing with the iphone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and the witness ran to the video camera. this also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects the witness had seen before this were the two red ones. also, all the witness saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; the witness assumed the flashes were from objects that weren’t visible in the dark. thus, perhaps the spots the witness saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed venus.\r\nthis photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but the witness may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.\r\nperhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that ufos will suddenly blink out or disappear.\r\n\r\nthe witness was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. the witness was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.\r\nthe video definitely showed some of the object’s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. it also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer ones \r\nthe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. these were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have been other colors that just didn’t photograph). these objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. the first two red objects that the witness had seen with by eye shone a very bright red–sort of a blood red color. two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. however, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing. \r\nthe white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (the photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. the neighbors were relatives and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).\r\nthe witness had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. although the witness didn’t see this with by eye when the witness took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while–the video captured them three times. the witness don’t know if these red objects were the same ones the witness saw with by eye at the beginning when they passed venus. there were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and the witness don’t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. the witness had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in the original observation by eyesight but don’t know if these were what the witness was seeing in the video. sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. the witness don’t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. the witness had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).\r\nthe video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. the witness don’t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two the witness saw with by eye (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed venus). these were not vertical as the ones the witness saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. these two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. the two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. if these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.\r\nthe witness saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.\r\nat other times, the witness would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. the witness couldn’t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. sometimes the witness would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. the witness also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. there seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. the witness don’t know if there were other colors. \r\nthe red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. in airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. the first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. and the time between views was less for the last one also. the distance between the red objects varied. thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft. \r\nother oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. their blinking pattern wasn’t regular. also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. they might have been traveling upward after they had passed at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. if aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. these appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn’t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. and if these were the lighting on a craft, the witness should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. but the witness didn’t see them again–they slowed only three times. \r\nin comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did. \r\nthese were nothing like strobe lights. although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. there was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. in comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. these white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. their strobbing wasn’t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.\r\nthere were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. the witness didn’t remember from seeing them with by eye if there were other colors. in general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly. \r\nno object’s flashes were recorded in exactly the same place, so the witness photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. \r\nthere was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. in several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. the planets never appeared as double. some of the object’s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. sometimes ufos are reported as merging or coming apart. these double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.\r\nthere were several indications that these objects had some form of power. one reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. the ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. also, they glowed and this glowing would take power. in addition, they were able to blink off and on. blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. the ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects. \r\n\r\nduring the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. the first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. venus and the moon are a distance apart. venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn’t really move). a number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.\r\nbecause this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. for example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. a close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the moon. the display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the moon.\r\nthese object’s flashes could also be compared to the general background. the witness took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. the background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. the objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches. \r\nbecause the background isn’t white, the witness thought most of the white flashes are from objects. unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. the red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. however, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. an instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. at 00.08  – - 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. but as they continued, they became less well defined. at 00:10 – -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. on their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. then they disappeared and didn’t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. perhaps they had sped off. \r\nthe white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. they often would appear for only one click. because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn’t be seen. \r\nthe bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. however, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. if these objects were some kind of camera artifacts, the objects would be visible on both sides. (when the witness had first seen the display it was to the west of venus and heading east and then the flashing objects covered a wide area of the sky but they were drifting to the east and by the time the witness had the camcorder on, the witness was just photographing the tail end of the group. when the witness took the video, the witness thought it might be too late to get anything, but the witness did photograph some of it.) thus, because the flashing was mainly on the left side of the video, the right side might be used as a sort of control for how the normal sky would appear. the witness has many videos that could be compared to this one and used as controls.\r\nthe video began with a wide-angle exposure. a white light appeared at 00:00 – -00.25. it was below the moon and to the left of venus. because the camcorder was recording at the wide angle setting and shows both the moon, venus, and silhouettes of the trees, it demonstrations that even at this stage (as the group of objects flew east) that objects could appear far enough west to show that the display took up a considerable angular distance. \r\ntwo (or maybe 3) white objects appeared at 00:02 – -00:23, then more flashes appeared. increased activity begins at about 00:07. one of several double appearing white blinks occurred at 00:08 – -00:17, another was at  (00:08 – -00.07), and another at  00:015– -00:10. these may be two white lights that are near each other when they flashed.  one white object flashed twice in about the same location (00:16 – -00.09 and 6 clicks later also at  00:16 – -00.09).  at 00:11 – -00.14 four fairly dim white objects flashed; two of these were quite close together. \r\nat 00:13 – -00.12, a white object appears in a wide view above a tree silhouette, and 3 clicks later another white object appears to its right and some distance away compared to the tree silhouette. nothing was visible during further clicks. one trailing, dim white object appeared to show on the right side as late as 00:19 – -00.06.\r\nthe first two red objects appeared at 00:07 – -00.18, they then continue to appear together through 8 clicks until the furthest left one blinked out at  (still at 00:07 – -00.18), then another one appeared below the former position of the left one (still at 00:07 – -00.18). after that two red objects appeared together again at (00:07 – -00.17), and then after another click a third red object appeared ((00:07 – -00.17). the two red objects appeared together again at 00.09 – -00.16. sometimes a red object would appear by itself such as at 00:09 – - 00.16. at 00:08 – -00.17 two red objects that have stayed together are visible, in one click the one on the left becomes fainter and sort of appears as if it is moving down, in the next click a red object appears under the right red object that is still on, as if the left object moved to the right and under the right object which stayed lit. because several red objects sometimes came on together, possibly they were lights on a larger craft. sometimes they would form a triangle.\r\nboth white and red objects sometimes appeared to have trails, for example white one at 00:03 – -00.22. \r\nthese red objects were sharp, but others sometimes appeared that were less sharp and the witness didn’t know if these were just photographic artifacts, or objects with dimmer lights, or red objects in motion. some of the white flashes were much clearer and more distinct than others. when the witness am recording stars or airplanes with this camera after dark, the witness see no flashing objects like this, so they weren’t camera artifacts. the main time there are camera artifacts on this camera’s videos is when the battery is low. these artifacts are normally rectangular-shaped and sometimes they contain colors or designs. they aren’t flashing objects like these. \r\nthe witness posted this video on youtube on that day and has posted more several more times. because one could see a lot less on youtube than on the hidef video, the witness just posted several slowed down, enhancements of the video to show what some of the blinking objects looked like and a general view. the witness also tried adding a hidef video, but the youtube ones didn’t have enough pixels to show much and the witness received no comments. \r\nthe witness thought the iphone was pointing in the general area of the southwest when the witness took the photos and the photos were in full high definition. \r\nthe camcorder was mounted on a tripod and pointing south. it was a sony hdr-hc5 hdv 1080 4mp minidv hi with 10x optical zoom and digital zoom. the recording was made in 1080p full high-definition video on dv cassette tape. the camera has night vision, but the witness had it set for day vision, so the witness could see the color of the planets. the video was transferred to an imac computer using imovie. the video is large, 425 mb, and the witness did not know how to send it. the youtube video upload shows much less than the actual video. \r\nthe witness has the original photographs that were sent from the iphone tothe computer and the tracking information. the witness thinks the gps had been turned off. \r\nthe photo’s exif data existed. this worked and the witness was able to extract the digital information from the photographs, as shown below:\r\nthe witness used the internet program “camerasummary.Coms” to extract the exif information. the photographs that had originally mailed to the computer provided a complete exif. \r\nthis worked and i was able to extract the digital information from the photographs, as shown below:\r\ni used the internet program https://camerasummary.Coms to extract the exif information and that for the first iphone

the video, a photo of objects by iphone, and a photo of the planets taken immediately before the sighting\r\n\r\n\r\n/// ///\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbright red and white flying, flashing objects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sighting, november 4, 2016, took place at approximately 7:22-7:26 pm est. it began while the witness was standing in the back yard photographing astronomical objects. thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain ufos, because when it happened the witness was photographing venus, mars, saturn, and the moon and the witness labeled them on some of the photographs. the witness is an amateur astronomer, has worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, the witness had two cameras with me. the cameras were an iphone 6s and a hidef camcorder that also records sound. the witness has made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. everything the witness saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.\r\nit started when the witness was looking southwest at venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. they flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. there were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. the object’s lights didn’t blink or change in intensity or brightness. the movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. from this first second of the sighting, the witness was mystified.\r\nthey approached venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, the witness thought they had to be connected. the witness watched for what would happen when they would pass venus. they were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. when they went by venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full moon's apparent diameter above venus and the lower one about the same distance below venus–the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with venus in the middle. they moved so synchronously that the witness expected them to be connected. although the witness couldn’t see any connection, the witness thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.\r\nbut when they passed by venus, the witness saw no dimming, so the witness didn't know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn’t show up much when they flew past venus). they didn’t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. they looked nothing like chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.\r\nthey flew in a controlled fashion–they stayed in a vertical position. the witness didn’t know how they flew–and didn’t hear engine noises but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. the witness was amazed because they looked like something that couldn’t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, the witness thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. the witness don’t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.\r\nthe witness had been taking photos of the planets with the iphone in hand when the witness saw them. but the witness was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that the witness didn’t do anything except stand there frozen. when the brain finally re-activated, the witness realized the witness needed to take photos so the witness took pictures–snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 est each 5 seconds after the previous one. this was after the red objects had already passed. the witness think the witness didn’t see anything when the witness took these photos. \r\nthen the witness noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. this display took up a large area of the sky–maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. it spread from the tree to the southeast to west of venus, which was to the west. \r\nbecause the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, the witness ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion.  it took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. it was mounted on a tripod. by the time, the witness had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so the witness couldn’t see them. the witness thought the tail end of the objects was still there. the witness pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. when the witness had seen them by eye they appeared to flash, move around–sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. all this was soundless. there seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. these were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. the witness took a 26-second video (although that doesn’t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).\r\nthe size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. a low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at john glenn columbus international airport–about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the moon or smaller. the size of the moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. it shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. the car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. if the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.\r\nthere was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. this is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around.  the neighbors are the relatives and the witness knew what they are doing. the witness is very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.\r\nthese objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. the sighting was nothing like viewing a drone–the witness has a drone, flies it, photographs with it, and repairs it, so the witness is familiar with drones. the objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). what the witness saw were bodies against the sky. it was nothing like fireworks. the witness has recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. this was nothing like chinese lanterns–several chinese lanterns have landed in the field the witness filmed in and has them. they weren’t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don’t light up at night. the witness saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. the witness read that all aircraft built after march 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. there was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft–just white flashes at random all over the sky. in addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object’s blinking. \r\nthe white flashing objects were nothing like stars. when one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. but they do not completely disappear and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. the stars and planets have stable locations. thus, the phenomenon wasn’t photographs of stars or twinkling. both cameras can photograph stars at night. also the witness had seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. the witness has also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out–the witness may even have one that the witness collected here years ago. these last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.\r\nthe camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when the witness rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.\r\nthe witness wasn’t sure about the colors–whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. the objects blinked in random patterns–nothing like an airplane. \r\nthe objects the witness watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, the witness had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. in the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what the witness captured of these were flashes. occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.\r\nafter the witness recorded the views, the iphone and camcorder were taken into the house and the witness e-mailed the camera photos to the computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. the witness still has the original e-mails and camcorder tape. there was a game going on at the school several miles to the west and so the witness contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. the answer was no, and the witness didn’t think so to begin with but checked anyway.  later the witness called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. they said no, and suggested calling the bigelow organization that collects ufo information. they returned the call several days later, but the witness didn’t get back to them. the witness immediately on november 4 posted the video both on youtube and facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but the witness didn’t find out anything. the original november 4 youtube videos and other posts are still on.\r\nthe witness also checked the weather which said: “wind    \r\nwind speed     4 mph (north)              \r\nmax wind speed         14 mph           \r\nmax gust speed 17 mph           \r\nvisibility       8 miles and from the north at 7: 51”\r\nthe wind was blowing from north to south. the objects traveled from west to east. if the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power. \r\nbecause this was the backyard, the witness has taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. for example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don’t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. these other videos don’t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.\r\nimmediately after the witness made the photography, the witness wondered if  anything had been photographed, because this was difficult photography. it was dark, which made it difficult to use the iphone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. but when the witness uploaded everything to the computer, the witness was amazed that everything had worked–the cameras had come on instantly and in focus. \r\nthe witness had taken three photos by iphone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. these three turned out well and although the witness thought the witness had photographed nothing because the witness did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and the witness didn’t see anything when t the photographs were taken, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera. \r\nthe videotape also turned out much better than the witness expected. the witness might have seen a few flashes when the witness made the video, but the actual video showed much more. when the witness clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. the witness had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashes.\r\n\r\nwhen the witness uploaded the three photographs into the computer, the witness noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. they were generally to the east of venus. although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).\r\nin order to check whether the spots were in the same place, the witness made computer transparencies and overlaid them. this showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.\r\nin order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, the witness looked at the photos that were taken right before the witness saw the two red objects. there were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. thus, the spots didn’t appear to be part of the natural background. they also wouldn’t be some form of camera artifact.\r\nwith this camera, the witness can easily photograph such objects as mars and saturn and has even photographed dimmer objects such as neptune and asteroids, so the witness was familiar with the camera’s performance. the stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. the witness saw no airplanes at the time the witness took the photographs and the witness would have noticed them because the witness was looking at venus. moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and the witness would definitely have noticed. the only things the witness had seen near venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before the witness took the photographs. also, the witness doubt if the camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. the objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as mars. the trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. in addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don’t more around.\r\nalthough the only objects the witness saw were the two red ones, it appeared that the witness had photographed several other things. because the witness had seen the red objects by eye, the witness thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. the witness think they weren’t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots the witness photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.\r\nthus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after the witness saw the two red ones. the witness didn’t see these when the witness took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.\r\nthese spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as mars had photographed. the witness thought if birds had photographed they would have appeared dark. thus, the witness thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.\r\nthe witness quit photographing with the iphone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and the witness ran to the video camera. this also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects the witness had seen before this were the two red ones. also, all the witness saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; the witness assumed the flashes were from objects that weren’t visible in the dark. thus, perhaps the spots the witness saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed venus.\r\nthis photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but the witness may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.\r\nperhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that ufos will suddenly blink out or disappear.\r\n\r\nthe witness was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. the witness was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.\r\nthe video definitely showed some of the object’s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. it also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer ones \r\nthe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. these were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have been other colors that just didn’t photograph). these objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. the first two red objects that the witness had seen with by eye shone a very bright red–sort of a blood red color. two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. however, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing. \r\nthe white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (the photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. the neighbors were relatives and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).\r\nthe witness had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. although the witness didn’t see this with by eye when the witness took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while–the video captured them three times. the witness don’t know if these red objects were the same ones the witness saw with by eye at the beginning when they passed venus. there were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and the witness don’t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. the witness had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in the original observation by eyesight but don’t know if these were what the witness was seeing in the video. sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. the witness don’t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. the witness had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).\r\nthe video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. the witness don’t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two the witness saw with by eye (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed venus). these were not vertical as the ones the witness saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. these two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. the two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. if these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.\r\nthe witness saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.\r\nat other times, the witness would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. the witness couldn’t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. sometimes the witness would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. the witness also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. there seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. the witness don’t know if there were other colors. \r\nthe red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. in airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. the first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. and the time between views was less for the last one also. the distance between the red objects varied. thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft. \r\nother oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. their blinking pattern wasn’t regular. also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. they might have been traveling upward after they had passed at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. if aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. these appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn’t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. and if these were the lighting on a craft, the witness should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. but the witness didn’t see them again–they slowed only three times. \r\nin comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did. \r\nthese were nothing like strobe lights. although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. there was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. in comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. these white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. their strobbing wasn’t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.\r\nthere were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. the witness didn’t remember from seeing them with by eye if there were other colors. in general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly. \r\nno object’s flashes were recorded in exactly the same place, so the witness photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. \r\nthere was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. in several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. the planets never appeared as double. some of the object’s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. sometimes ufos are reported as merging or coming apart. these double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.\r\nthere were several indications that these objects had some form of power. one reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. the ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. also, they glowed and this glowing would take power. in addition, they were able to blink off and on. blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. the ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects. \r\n\r\nduring the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. the first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. venus and the moon are a distance apart. venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn’t really move). a number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.\r\nbecause this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. for example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. a close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the moon. the display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the moon.\r\nthese object’s flashes could also be compared to the general background. the witness took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. the background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. the objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches. \r\nbecause the background isn’t white, the witness thought most of the white flashes are from objects. unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. the red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. however, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. an instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. at 00.08  – - 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. but as they continued, they became less well defined. at 00:10 – -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. on their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. then they disappeared and didn’t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. perhaps they had sped off. \r\nthe white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. they often would appear for only one click. because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn’t be seen. \r\nthe bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. however, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. if these objects were some

it and notice the contrail is not fading out and it looks more like a rocket flame. i thought it was being lit by the sun but as the sun cleared the horizon the light from the object did not change. call it a flaming arrowhead with a rounded point. now i'm thinking something's not right so i grab my 90mm telescope. object is pretty far off in the distance and i looked for something to be at the tip of the flame but there's nothing there. i'm also getting some distortion from the warming air.I. decide its not a rocket flame while outline is vague it really isn't changing shape and while it's moving in a straight line its dog tracking a little and one edge is slightly longer than the other. its centerline was not quite in line with its direction. also it never really went over the horizon it just kept going straight like when i've watched the iss fly by. i never had any unusual feelings or saw any strange phenomenon. one thing though there are several flight paths for aircraft around my house but during this event there was not a single aircraft anywhere in the sky. none.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  i have now turned 65. this event happened, when i was around ten years old.  i just read your latest sighting reports. they mentioned, lights in a triangle pattern. this is similar to what i saw eventally, after the hover just above me. so i have decided to tell this event after all these years.   it happened a few miles ouside of angola indiana, in 1962. my father was a college proffesser, one day a former airo student of his came flying over our house out in the country, in a huge goodyear blimp. he threw out a long rope to me out in the back yard. i caught it , he opened the big side window shut off the blimp engines, and yelled is your dad there? yes i said ill get him. dad came out, the pilot yelled i will land, and you and your son hop in.  dad said can you fly over to the local airport , we will meet you there? yes said the pilot. so soon i was flying in the good year blimp with dad, and his former college student. the reason i tell you this , is the spacecraft came in a few days later and hovered less than 100 feet above me exactly where the goodyear blimp hovered a few days before throwing me the rope. it was 9 to 10 pm one night ,i was out in that back yard, with my friend from school, he was also 10 years old. i had my unitron telescope set up out in the yard looking at the stars . i herd a low base barely audible hum come and go coming from the ne, just above tree line above the huge maple trees , that i routinely climbed. i could barely make out an completely unlit up aircraft moving in my direction from 700 to 800 feet out.At less than ten miles per hour. now here is where i made the biggest mistake of my life. i was a young kid, and i had recently read an article in a magizine in town about a guy who described being ubducted, and they stuck a huge hypodermic needle up his noze to take a brain sample. they showed an artist rendition of this . being just a kid this scarred me , and i hated doctors and needles! so very quickly i ran into the house to mom and dads bedroom. they were a sleep. i grabbed my dads world war 2 45 auto pistal. from the chest next to there bed. i stuck it down my front trousers, somewhat out of site. i ran back outside , and here she came! she eased down just above me around 60 to 80 feet over my head. she stoped completely. no lights , no noise. i think they would have greeted me who knows? but i fear they saw the gun in my pants!  that blew the whole deal! the aircraft slowly began to move away in a flat direction out over the valley. after it got out about 200 to 300 feet away, she lit up what i belive where here engines. in the belly of the aircraft , sitting in a perfect triangle pattern from each other , were three deep cylinders going up into the base of the aircraft. they had not been visible before until they lit up with a mild blue green glowing light. now i had some light so i could now take a close look up inside those possible engines, with my unitron telescope, i selected, a 50 0r 60 power lens , off the roller of lenses on the scope since she was still so close. very interestingly, the light inside the cylinders,or maybe engines, was rotating in a right hand direction around the inside surface of the walls of each of the three cylinders! next thing happened i thought she was going to crash! she began to tilt to the right, then come back up level then tilt to the left. it was like she was trying to get just the right angle as i began to gather she wasn't crashing, she was getting set up to go! she nozed up to about 50 or 60 degrees. the lights got a little brighter in her belly, next she lit out climbing fast! i increased the magnification to 200 power, then 400, then finally using the barlow lens in my unitron refractor scope i was at 600 power as i recall. \"then she disaperred out amunst the stars. she looked like only another star, then gone. me this little kid was totally enlitened. and also very unhapy with myself for grabbing the gun. because it likely caused me to miss the chance of a lifetime. i may have had the chance to explore the universe with them. i have never seen them again threw out my 65 years of life. a few minutes later my dad came running out , and said give the gun , what are you doing? i pointed to the sky, and told him what had just happened. he said you are just seeing things . don't tell anyone what you just told me! or they will think you may be sick and crazy, and send you away. so all my life till now this has been, locked inside me. i just learned about mufon . so i have decided to tell you people what happened. i am glad to here that other people have recently seen what may be related the the same triangle lit aircraft, or should i say spacecraft. i am in hopes that they are back here. and maybe they have the power to stop the human race from distroying this planet. they must think we are a ship of fools! if they gave me another chance i would quickly climb on board with them in a heartbeat!","distance":"21-100

distance, through some trees, and i thought at first that it was a cell tower but then i remembered that there is no cell tower or any other sort of lighted tower there.  the trees were obstructing my view so i waited to pull over until i had driven out where there was no obstruction to my view and i pulled over onto the side of the road.  (it only took approx 15-30 secs to get out of the treed area and to the clear view and parked)  i got out of my car to observe them.  the lights were quite a distance from me, probably at least a mile out but less that 1.5 miles i think.  they were at the sky line and i noted that it was interesting that they seemed to be doing a sort of design in the sky.  i saw one star like white lite fly straight up and then suddenly stop and then two other star like lights, slightly smaller than the first flew down at angles to the central one so that they formed a triad and then another light came straight down to form an elongated diamond.  then one by one they blinked out.  the big one in the top center was the last to blink out.  it stayed there blinking and then slowly faded it's light out.  there was something else the bigger light did that was strange but i can't remember where it fit in this sort of dance they did.  it was blinking and then suddenly got brighter and from it's left side, it seemed to fling out these sparks of colored light in an arch that dissipated quickly.  the colors were blue, red, green.  it almost looked like what you would expect from a fire work but there was no sound and it was more controlled.  thank you for this opportunity to tell my observation.  i first told it to nuforc.Org and someone called back and left a message that it was probably soldiers from the base practicing jumps.  it did happen near the base but if those were soldiers practicing parachuting.....They have got some pretty wild moves and are able to control their flight

dusk. i was outside placing christmas lights on a small tree in the yard and just happened to look up in a ne direction, as i was standing there looking at the tree i was decorating.  noticed several small white objects, probably 6 to 10 of them, seeming to just float around up in the sky.  estimate them to be over 200+ feet up. thought at first someone must have released some helium balloons or something.  watched for a minute or two and saw that they moved a little in a northern direction all in a scattered pattern, which is why i first thought they might have been helium balloons moving with the upper winds.  then observed them form a circular position, stay in that spot for a few seconds and move a little to the south.  then they seemed to scatter a little and just disappeared either due to the distance and moving upward.  kept looking for them and about 15 seconds later, they reappeared again in a semi-scatter position, some still in a circular pattern, with a few moving away from the circle to the south. looked like orbs or small circular objects. went to get my wife, step daughter and two of my granddaughters to take a look at these things.  my wife came out onto the porch and when she came over to where i was observing them, we could no longer find them in the sky. from the time i spotted them until i could not see them anymore was about 10 minutes.  they could have already been there longer before i noticed them, who knows.\r\n\r\nanyway, never have seen any ufo's or orbs in my life, but thought this was really strange.  i don't think upper winds

light hovering across the street from our home--i would 100 to 150 feet away.  we both initially thought it was a helicopter with a search lights.  these lights were white and were arranged in a single row of three.  they were so bright that you could only look at them directly for a very short period of time.  also, because the lights were so bright you could not see the object that was emitting the light.  we initially stopped our car on the road in front of our home and watched the lights from inside the car for about 5 minutes.  after the lights went out i quickly pulled the car into our driveway at which time we both got out of the car.  i then looked in the direction which we see the lights and i then spotted a 30-40 foot black triangle--all sides were the same size.  the triangle had 5 pinkish/orange lights (close to the color of a sodium vapor street light) on each side of the mid-section of the craft.  the craft started to move very, very slowly towards us like it detected our presence.  as the craft got closer, i ran to the side of the road, and it was at this time directly the other side of the road.  the craft was only a two lane road without shoulders away and it was just about the telephone poles.  it was so close i could have thrown a stone at it and hit it.  while it was directly across from me i could see the top and bottom of the craft was flat/non-reflective black in color and i didn't see any seams or joint.  the mid-section was a flat/non-reflective; dark grey color and the pinkish/orange lights were being emitted from hemispherical globes maybe 3 or 4 foot in diameter. the mid-section also had narrow, vertical ridges which were cylindrical in shape and were as tall as the mid-section, which i would estimate to be about 8-10 feet in height. the lights were steady and didn't blink or change intensity.  the craft continued to move slowly following the edge of the road.  i walked with the craft following it from the other side of the road until i reach the edge of our property.  the craft continued to move down the road until it took a right turn, which the craft did not bank or change speed.  i saw the craft go on the far side of my neighbor’s house and head out over a field that is behind my house.  i stood on a little berm a watched the craft make its way out over the field-the speed or its altitude never changed.  after it made its way out over the field, when it was approximate 200-250 feet away, it just blinked out.  it didn't zoom away at a high rate of speed, it just simply disappeared.  i was dumbfounded by this and stood there in total disbelief for another 10 minutes or so.  the craft never reappeared, it was gone.  i never felt scared at any point, i felt totally calm the entire time.  i had the awareness to check my watch from the very beginning of the sighting and the event lasted roughly 15 minutes and there was no missing time involved.  this event occurred on april 20, 1995 between approximately 1:15 - 1:30 am.  the craft emitted no sounds, no smells, and no heat.  i didn't see anything that looked like a convention aircraft engine.  the craft's motion was very slow and fluid, no wobbling or jerkiness.  even though the sighting occurred 22 years ago, until this very day i cannot get that event out of my mind.  whenever i get idle time during the day or night i automatically start thinking about it.  i often times have dreams involving ufo sightings, which seem extremely realistic. i have had other strange events happen to me after that sighting which i'd rather not discuss at this time. in closing, there is no doubt in my mind what i saw that night.  this craft was literally only a few feet in front of me; it wasn't a mere light in the sky.  i'm not claiming it was from an alien world, but if our military has this kind of technology and if it is that big of a secret, why would they being flying an ultra-top secret craft like that directly across the street from my house, which makes no sense.

unusually back and forth the going straight before changing direction. i  then started looking around the sky directly above head and noticed 20-25 of the objects. i can see orion's belt and so i decided to use it as a point of reference, those stars remained stationary. it also appears that there are brighter ones accompanied by a smaller dimmer one each moving in tandem getting closer to each other then moving apart and then doing it again. some of the larger,brighter singular ones appear to be pulsating and moving in a very tight figure 8 formation. for lack of a better explanation i came to the conclusion that this was some type of \"invasion\" where these objects were taking up positions in the sky, the whole sky. the light pollution in my neighborhood is prolific but my wife was able to capture some cell phone video of the brighter singular objects and what was not visible until we reviewed that footage that all around the object at varying distances  were\r\nmillisecond small flashes of white and red light intermittent and random.\r\n   i do not know what they are, if they were not doing the strange things i have mentioned i would assume they were stars but this most certainly has me puzzled.  my  wife also called the local news station wsfa and they said that they would have their meteorologist go outside and take a look but she hung up the phone and had the feeling they thought she was crazy and or drunk. it is now 11:30 pm and as i head to bed i can still observe most if not all of the objects. i look forward to the morning to see if it was just me or if any other similar reports were submitted since i am sure they could be seen over the entire se us.","distance":"Over One

\r\n\r\ni frequent the restroom many times each night because of a medical problem that causes me to be a very light sleeper.\r\n\r\ni live with my two disabled parents and since noises easily wake and disturb them i have become very adapt to visiting the restroom in the middle of the night while being as very quiet as possible.\r\n\r\nthe restroom is located down a thirty foot hallway and the hallway goes straight from my bedroom door directly to the restroom door.\r\n\r\non one side of the hallway there are two other bedrooms and on the other side of the hallway is the living room and the kitchen.\r\n\r\nthe living room has a doorway accessing the kitchen as well as a doorway accessing the hallway right outside my bedroom door.\r\n\r\nall the lights in the house were turned off except for a small night light in the kitchen which remains on all night for our cat to eat with.\r\n\r\ni did not notice anything different when i was walking to the restroom except one thing.\r\n\r\ni thought i had felt a slight electrical type charge in the atmosphere that made the house feel a little different, it did not feel like our house usually feels.\r\n\r\ni was in the restroom for maybe three or four minutes before i was ready to go back to my bedroom.\r\n\r\ni turned off the restroom light and as i was getting ready to turn the door knob to exit the restroom when i heard sounds that i misidentified.\r\n\r\nat first i thought i was hearing my cat's claws clicking on the kitchen floor as he was walking across it, which is a usual sound in the middle of the night because he eats his meals every night between 3 a.M. and 5 a.M.\r\n\r\ni quietly turned the door knob and exited the restroom.\r\n\r\ni was then standing in the hallway closing the restroom door behind me very quietly like i always do.\r\n\r\nthe sound i misidentified seemed to be getting closer but i didn't think anything about it.\r\n\r\ni took one step forward toward my bedroom and i looked to my right.\r\n\r\ni thought i was going to be looking at my cat in the kitchen.\r\n\r\ni saw an alien about six feet away turning to look at me from the kitchen.\r\n\r\ni froze in mid stride and i looked at it for about five seconds while it was staring back at me.\r\n\r\nit was a short grey alien between three and four feet tall with a large head that had big black slanted eyes, no ears, a stubby nose and a small mouth.\r\n\r\nit's arms were long in proportion to its body.\r\n\r\nit was being back lit by the night light and appeared to be a off white grayish color\r\n\r\nwhile i was looking at the alien it began making soft clicking noises with its small mouth.\r\n\r\ni was standing there trying to figure out what to do.\r\n\r\ni began feeling more electricity in the air and i was trying to figure out if what i was looking at was real.\r\n\r\na feeling of ease came over me and inside my head i heard a voice say to me that there was 'no danger, this might not be real'.\r\n\r\nbeing confused and scared i wanted to believe the voice in my head because i wanted to get away.\r\n\r\ni raised my right hand to see what would happen and the alien raised its right hand back at me.\r\n\r\ni started walking down the hallway toward my bed room and i couldn't stop thinking about going back to sleep.\r\n\r\ni got halfway down the hallway to my bed room door and i remember thinking 'what if there's more than one of those in the house'.\r\n\r\ni stopped in front of my bed room door so i could open it.\r\n\r\nas i was reaching out to grab the knob on the door i looked into the living room.\r\n\r\nabout four feet away from me, standing in the doorway to the kitchen, was a tall alien that was facing towards me and was looking directly at me.\r\n\r\nit was basically like the short grey alien except it's torso was much longer making it about six to six and a half feet tall.\r\n\r\ni heard a calm and soft voice in my head saying, 'its ok just go back to sleep now'.\r\n\r\ni raised my right hand and moved it like i was waving.\r\n\r\nthe alien raised it's right hand and waved back just like the short alien had done.\r\n\r\nby this time i was feeling a strong buzzing sensation all over my body.\r\n\r\ni remember hearing some more soft clicking sounds coming from the tall alien.\r\n\r\ni was overcome with an impulse i couldn't resist that made me reach out and open my bed room door.\r\n\r\ni walked into my bed room and closed the door behind me.\r\n\r\ni got into bed and fell asleep as though nothing had ever happened.","distance":"20 Feet or

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\r\n\r\nbright red and white flying, flashing objects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sighting, november 4, 2016, took place at approximately 7:22-7:26 pm est. it began while the witness was standing in the back yard photographing astronomical objects. thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain ufos, because when it happened the witness was photographing venus, mars, saturn, and the moon and the witness labeled them on some of the photographs. the witness is an amateur astronomer, has worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, the witness had two cameras with me. the cameras were an iphone 6s and a hidef camcorder that also records sound. the witness has made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. everything the witness saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.\r\nit started when the witness was looking southwest at venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. they flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. there were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. the object’s lights didn’t blink or change in intensity or brightness. the movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. from this first second of the sighting, the witness was mystified.\r\nthey approached venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, the witness thought they had to be connected. the witness watched for what would happen when they would pass venus. they were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. when they went by venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full moon's apparent diameter above venus and the lower one about the same distance below venus–the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with venus in the middle. they moved so synchronously that the witness expected them to be connected. although the witness couldn’t see any connection, the witness thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.\r\nbut when they passed by venus, the witness saw no dimming, so the witness didn't know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn’t show up much when they flew past venus). they didn’t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. they looked nothing like chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.\r\nthey flew in a controlled fashion–they stayed in a vertical position. the witness didn’t know how they flew–and didn’t hear engine noises but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. the witness was amazed because they looked like something that couldn’t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, the witness thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. the witness don’t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.\r\nthe witness had been taking photos of the planets with the iphone in hand when the witness saw them. but the witness was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that the witness didn’t do anything except stand there frozen. when the brain finally re-activated, the witness realized the witness needed to take photos so the witness took pictures–snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 est each 5 seconds after the previous one. this was after the red objects had already passed. the witness think the witness didn’t see anything when the witness took these photos. \r\nthen the witness noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. this display took up a large area of the sky–maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. it spread from the tree to the southeast to west of venus, which was to the west. \r\nbecause the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, the witness ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion.  it took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. it was mounted on a tripod. by the time, the witness had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so the witness couldn’t see them. the witness thought the tail end of the objects was still there. the witness pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. when the witness had seen them by eye they appeared to flash, move around–sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. all this was soundless. there seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. these were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. the witness took a 26-second video (although that doesn’t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).\r\nthe size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. a low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at john glenn columbus international airport–about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the moon or smaller. the size of the moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. it shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. the car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. if the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.\r\nthere was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. this is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around.  the neighbors are the relatives and the witness knew what they are doing. the witness is very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.\r\nthese objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. the sighting was nothing like viewing a drone–the witness has a drone, flies it, photographs with it, and repairs it, so the witness is familiar with drones. the objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). what the witness saw were bodies against the sky. it was nothing like fireworks. the witness has recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. this was nothing like chinese lanterns–several chinese lanterns have landed in the field the witness filmed in and has them. they weren’t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don’t light up at night. the witness saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. the witness read that all aircraft built after march 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. there was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft–just white flashes at random all over the sky. in addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object’s blinking. \r\nthe white flashing objects were nothing like stars. when one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. but they do not completely disappear and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. the stars and planets have stable locations. thus, the phenomenon wasn’t photographs of stars or twinkling. both cameras can photograph stars at night. also the witness had seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. the witness has also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out–the witness may even have one that the witness collected here years ago. these last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.\r\nthe camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when the witness rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.\r\nthe witness wasn’t sure about the colors–whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. the objects blinked in random patterns–nothing like an airplane. \r\nthe objects the witness watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, the witness had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. in the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what the witness captured of these were flashes. occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.\r\nafter the witness recorded the views, the iphone and camcorder were taken into the house and the witness e-mailed the camera photos to the computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. the witness still has the original e-mails and camcorder tape. there was a game going on at the school several miles to the west and so the witness contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. the answer was no, and the witness didn’t think so to begin with but checked anyway.  later the witness called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. they said no, and suggested calling the bigelow organization that collects ufo information. they returned the call several days later, but the witness didn’t get back to them. the witness immediately on november 4 posted the video both on youtube and facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but the witness didn’t find out anything. the original november 4 youtube videos and other posts are still on.\r\nthe witness also checked the weather which said: “wind    \r\nwind speed     4 mph (north)              \r\nmax wind speed         14 mph           \r\nmax gust speed 17 mph           \r\nvisibility       8 miles and from the north at 7: 51”\r\nthe wind was blowing from north to south. the objects traveled from west to east. if the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power. \r\nbecause this was the backyard, the witness has taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. for example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don’t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. these other videos don’t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.\r\nimmediately after the witness made the photography, the witness wondered if  anything had been photographed, because this was difficult photography. it was dark, which made it difficult to use the iphone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. but when the witness uploaded everything to the computer, the witness was amazed that everything had worked–the cameras had come on instantly and in focus. \r\nthe witness had taken three photos by iphone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. these three turned out well and although the witness thought the witness had photographed nothing because the witness did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and the witness didn’t see anything when t the photographs were taken, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera. \r\nthe videotape also turned out much better than the witness expected. the witness might have seen a few flashes when the witness made the video, but the actual video showed much more. when the witness clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. the witness had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashes.\r\n\r\nwhen the witness uploaded the three photographs into the computer, the witness noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. they were generally to the east of venus. although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).\r\nin order to check whether the spots were in the same place, the witness made computer transparencies and overlaid them. this showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.\r\nin order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, the witness looked at the photos that were taken right before the witness saw the two red objects. there were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. thus, the spots didn’t appear to be part of the natural background. they also wouldn’t be some form of camera artifact.\r\nwith this camera, the witness can easily photograph such objects as mars and saturn and has even photographed dimmer objects such as neptune and asteroids, so the witness was familiar with the camera’s performance. the stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. the witness saw no airplanes at the time the witness took the photographs and the witness would have noticed them because the witness was looking at venus. moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and the witness would definitely have noticed. the only things the witness had seen near venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before the witness took the photographs. also, the witness doubt if the camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. the objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as mars. the trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. in addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don’t more around.\r\nalthough the only objects the witness saw were the two red ones, it appeared that the witness had photographed several other things. because the witness had seen the red objects by eye, the witness thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. the witness think they weren’t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots the witness photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.\r\nthus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after the witness saw the two red ones. the witness didn’t see these when the witness took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.\r\nthese spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as mars had photographed. the witness thought if birds had photographed they would have appeared dark. thus, the witness thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.\r\nthe witness quit photographing with the iphone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and the witness ran to the video camera. this also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects the witness had seen before this were the two red ones. also, all the witness saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; the witness assumed the flashes were from objects that weren’t visible in the dark. thus, perhaps the spots the witness saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed venus.\r\nthis photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but the witness may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.\r\nperhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that ufos will suddenly blink out or disappear.\r\n\r\nthe witness was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. the witness was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.\r\nthe video definitely showed some of the object’s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. it also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer ones \r\nthe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. these were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have been other colors that just didn’t photograph). these objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. the first two red objects that the witness had seen with by eye shone a very bright red–sort of a blood red color. two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. however, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing. \r\nthe white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (the photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. the neighbors were relatives and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).\r\nthe witness had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. although the witness didn’t see this with by eye when the witness took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while–the video captured them three times. the witness don’t know if these red objects were the same ones the witness saw with by eye at the beginning when they passed venus. there were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and the witness don’t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. the witness had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in the original observation by eyesight but don’t know if these were what the witness was seeing in the video. sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. the witness don’t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. the witness had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).\r\nthe video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. the witness don’t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two the witness saw with by eye (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed venus). these were not vertical as the ones the witness saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. these two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. the two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. if these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.\r\nthe witness saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.\r\nat other times, the witness would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. the witness couldn’t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. sometimes the witness would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. the witness also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. there seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. the witness don’t know if there were other colors. \r\nthe red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. in airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. the first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. and the time between views was less for the last one also. the distance between the red objects varied. thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft. \r\nother oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. their blinking pattern wasn’t regular. also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. they might have been traveling upward after they had passed at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. if aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. these appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn’t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. and if these were the lighting on a craft, the witness should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. but the witness didn’t see them again–they slowed only three times. \r\nin comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did. \r\nthese were nothing like strobe lights. although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. there was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. in comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. these white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. their strobbing wasn’t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.\r\nthere were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. the witness didn’t remember from seeing them with by eye if there were other colors. in general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly. \r\nno object’s flashes were recorded in exactly the same place, so the witness photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. \r\nthere was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. in several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. the planets never appeared as double. some of the object’s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. sometimes ufos are reported as merging or coming apart. these double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.\r\nthere were several indications that these objects had some form of power. one reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. the ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. also, they glowed and this glowing would take power. in addition, they were able to blink off and on. blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. the ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects. \r\n\r\nduring the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. the first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. venus and the moon are a distance apart. venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn’t really move). a number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.\r\nbecause this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. for example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. a close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the moon. the display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the moon.\r\nthese object’s flashes could also be compared to the general background. the witness took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. the background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. the objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches. \r\nbecause the background isn’t white, the witness thought most of the white flashes are from objects. unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. the red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. however, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. an instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. at 00.08  – - 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. but as they continued, they became less well defined. at 00:10 – -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. on their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. then they disappeared and didn’t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. perhaps they had sped off. \r\nthe white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. they often would appear for only one click. because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn’t be seen. \r\nthe bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. however, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. if these objects were some kind of camera artifacts, the objects would be visible on both sides. (when the witness had first seen the display it was to the west of venus and heading east and then the flashing objects covered a wide area of the sky but they were drifting to the east and by the time the witness had the camcorder on, the witness was just photographing the tail end of the group. when the witness took the video, the witness thought it might be too late to get anything, but the witness did photograph some of it.) thus, because the flashing was mainly on the left side of the video, the right side might be used as a sort of control for how the normal sky would appear. the witness has many videos that could be compared to this one and used as controls.\r\nthe video began with a wide-angle exposure. a white light appeared at 00:00 – -00.25. it was below the moon and to the left of venus. because the camcorder was recording at the wide angle setting and shows both the moon, venus, and silhouettes of the trees, it demonstrations that even at this stage (as the group of objects flew east) that objects could appear far enough west to show that the display took up a considerable angular distance. \r\ntwo (or maybe 3) white objects appeared at 00:02 – -00:23, then more flashes appeared. increased activity begins at about 00:07. one of several double appearing white blinks occurred at 00:08 – -00:17, another was at  (00:08 – -00.07), and another at  00:015– -00:10. these may be two white lights that are near each other when they flashed.  one white object flashed twice in about the same location (00:16 – -00.09 and 6 clicks later also at  00:16 – -00.09).  at 00:11 – -00.14 four fairly dim white objects flashed; two of these were quite close together. \r\nat 00:13 – -00.12, a white object appears in a wide view above a tree silhouette, and 3 clicks later another white object appears to its right and some distance away compared to the tree silhouette. nothing was visible during further clicks. one trailing, dim white object appeared to show on the right side as late as 00:19 – -00.06.\r\nthe first two red objects appeared at 00:07 – -00.18, they then continue to appear together through 8 clicks until the furthest left one blinked out at  (still at 00:07 – -00.18), then another one appeared below the former position of the left one (still at 00:07 – -00.18). after that two red objects appeared together again at (00:07 – -00.17), and then after another click a third red object appeared ((00:07 – -00.17). the two red objects appeared together again at 00.09 – -00.16. sometimes a red object would appear by itself such as at 00:09 – - 00.16. at 00:08 – -00.17 two red objects that have stayed together are visible, in one click the one on the left becomes fainter and sort of appears as if it is moving down, in the next click a red object appears under the right red object that is still on, as if the left object moved to the right and under the right object which stayed lit. because several red objects sometimes came on together, possibly they were lights on a larger craft. sometimes they would form a triangle.\r\nboth white and red objects sometimes appeared to have trails, for example white one at 00:03 – -00.22. \r\nthese red objects were sharp, but others sometimes appeared that were less sharp and the witness didn’t know if these were just photographic artifacts, or objects with dimmer lights, or red objects in motion. some of the white flashes were much clearer and more distinct than others. when the witness am recording stars or airplanes with this camera after dark, the witness see no flashing objects like this, so they weren’t camera artifacts. the main time there are camera artifacts on this camera’s videos is when the battery is low. these artifacts are normally rectangular-shaped and sometimes they contain colors or designs. they aren’t flashing objects like these. \r\nthe witness posted this video on youtube on that day and has posted more several more times. because one could see a lot less on youtube than on the hidef video, the witness just posted several slowed down, enhancements of the video to show what some of the blinking objects looked like and a general view. the witness also tried adding a hidef video, but the youtube ones didn’t have enough pixels to show much and the witness received no comments. \r\nthe witness thought the iphone was pointing in the general area of the southwest when the witness took the photos and the photos were in full high definition. \r\nthe camcorder was mounted on a tripod and pointing south. it was a sony hdr-hc5 hdv 1080 4mp minidv hi with 10x optical zoom and digital zoom. the recording was made in 1080p full high-definition video on dv cassette tape. the camera has night vision, but the witness had it set for day vision, so the witness could see the color of the planets. the video was transferred to an imac computer using imovie. the video is large, 425 mb, and the witness did not know how to send it. the youtube video upload shows much less than the actual video. \r\nthe witness has the original photographs that were sent from the iphone tothe computer and the tracking information. the witness thinks the gps had been turned off. \r\nthe photo’s exif data existed. this worked and the witness was able to extract the digital information from the photographs, as shown below:\r\nthe witness used the internet program “camerasummary.Coms” to extract the exif information. the photographs that had originally mailed to the computer provided a complete exif. \r\nhave several videos on youtube. the first one below shows the general sighting.\r\nthe second one below shows a hidef upload, but it does not show nearly as much as the original video which is 1080p full hd
