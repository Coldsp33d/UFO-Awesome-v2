pittsburgh west of the allegheny county airport (located in west mifflin). my wife, walking the dog in our yard, noticed a string of uniformly spaced red lights at altitude (as one would expect a life flight helicopter to be) spanning at least 40 angular degrees. she called me to the yard, and i also observed them. i observed (at times using binoculars) that they appeared to be rising, in a spaced fashion, one after another, from a single point in the southeast and heading to the southwest. we estimated they were rising in the vicinity of the airport. one plane observed was perceived by us to be lingering in the area, but the plane, a commercial airliner or cargo plane, subsequently flew over our house, so the perception of lingering must have been due to a great initial distance and we observed it flying into the area. towards the end of the event, we perceived helicopters to be flying in the area of the airport near the point we witnessed the lights ascending. the lights were red, similar to radio tower lighting. the light to the southwest most point merely extinguished, and being distracted, but not seeing the others, they too apparently went out. my initial assessment is that they were some man made thing, such as \"sky lanterns\" lifted by balloon or the heat rising from a candle, but problems exist with this theory. 1. they were launched near the county airport, which i would suppose to be forbidden for a legal launch, as interference to or confusion of air traffic may ensue. 2. to suppose that they were equipped with electrical power for lighting or being equipped with a candle should have provided the most recently launched light with the ability to travel from the southeast launch point to the southwest extinguish point before itself extinguishing, this clearly did not happen. i returned to the house and alternately listened to a scanning radio for the police frequencies in my area of pittsburgh and to aircraft frequencies collectively. nothing was heard to indicate that any others had called to report this incident, nor were pilots, in their very brief communications, mentioning it. i subsequently noted an establishment across the street from the county airport as having a grand opening sign, but i'm not sure how old the sign is. i drove past the county airport travelling to work, on following days, but did not notice anything to account for the lights. we perused the media for a hint of a man made cause, but found none. we found this reporting page as a result.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

in the sky at a 45 degree angle from myself. the light at further examination was the shape of a slit and it was followed by two more lights on either side of the first light and to the rear. the position of the lights formed a triangle. once the object sailed directly over my head, i was able to confirm the shape of the object against the backdrop of the stars. it was a triangle just as described by many. it made no noise and just moved smoothly in one direction. nothing else was trailing it or around it. i am convinced that i was able to spot this object only because of the lunar

(i still am.)  my opinion was and still is that i was looking at an inter-gallactic craft.  after the event was over the captain turned to me and said:  \"did you see anything?\"  to which i responded:  \"no.\"  no report was ever filed and this is the first time i have ever written about it.  the captain continued to be friends until his death and neither of us ever spoke of the event again.  as a side note it was a cold winter night with snow on the ground.  i am very acquainted with the effects of temperature inversions and other \"tricks\" which can be played on the eyes.  this was none of them.  i am a retired airline captain and have over 29,000 of flying time.  i have never seen anything of this nature before of since the above event.  this event changed my life forever and has haunted me from that time to this.  thank you for the opportunity to get this off my chest.

 how could either of us not have seen that?  if it had been a blimp or helicopter, or even a small plane that close to us, we would have heard something.  there was no noise other than regular traffic.\r\ni have looked at these photographs five times today.  fascinated.  trying to figure out what that thing is and why we didn't see it when we were looking directly at its path.  thought of a lot of possibilities, but it doesn't seem to fit any category.  admittedly, i know very little about aircraft types, other than passenger planes, the stealth bomber and the flying wing, but it doesn't look like any plane i've seen, partly due to the unusual formation at the back, looking like a black triangle. doesn't seem to be a bird. not something on the windshield because it has moved behind a tree in the second photo.  i even looked up the schedule for the goodyear blimp, on the slim possibility that it might be that (although i have seen the blimp in person and it's noisy!).  blimp was in california this week anyway.  also, the object appears to be a dull gray color, no evidence of the blue and yellow on the blimp.\r\ni would be very interested to learn what others might think this is.  i'm not saying it's otherworldly, but it sure doesn't fit any parameters *i* know.\r\nthe images are numbered 1427 and 1429. image1428 is exactly the same as 1427 because i held my finger on the button too long. sadly, not realizing that i was taking a photo of something very interesting, after photo 1429, i moved on to taking photos of trees not obscured by wires.\r\nafter i file this report, i am going to go back and look at the photos yet again.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":61135,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.3800562,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11012014-0020","longitude":-76.7286565,"occurred":1414541040000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1414901480000,"summary":"Photos taken of fall trees, late afternoon. object not seen until photo was looked at days later.","tags":["photo"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/61135_submitter_file1__IMG1427.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/61135_submitter_file2__IMG1429.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"21208","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4,"locationName":"Pikesville, Maryland","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:86710"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Cozumel","country":"Mexico","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on vacation with my brother and my husband ,on board of the carnival ecstasy cruise ship top deck enjoying the evening in cozumel mexico. we traveled from south florida, u.S.A. and arrived in cozumel, mexico on october 30th, 2014. we enjoyed the small island beach's and mayan homes during the day (little population and close to no electricity ,,,very limited on the island) we came back on board the ship that evening around 9:00 p.M. after our day excursions, and relaxed on top deck by about 11:00p.M. (top deck is also the only place allowed on the ship for my brother(and all 100 plus other people to smoke cigarettes on the ship.Anyways,100+ people on top deck noticed something in the sky. at first i thought it was just a airplane from a far but as it got closer and closer then above the cruise ship it was apparent that it was in fact not at all an airplane. a lot of people went in side because they were scared, but i was such in awe and i couldn't believe what i was seeing that i didn't even think to move or go inside. most of the people were in shock like myself. it was a bright red sphere that glowed and moved very very very slow across the sky as it went up and down in elevation. it flew went right over the ship as if it was examining the ship. for those who do not know cozumel mexico doesn't have much light because the small islands population/very very poor locals(no power). anyways with that being said the cruise ship was the only bright light that the eyes could see & for that matter this aircraft was very curious. after about ten minutes of about now 60 people starring from the top deck ,it finally cruised along into the sky until it instantly disappeared. it was the talk of the cruise there after for the remaining of the cruise. my brother took multiple photos, but the crazy part is the aircraft can not be seen in any of the photos from his camera phone. i know for fact he took them with the aircraft above us. everyone's photo's had everything in the picture but the spacecraft.I am now a firm believer in u.F.O's . i was never before until october 30th, 2014. after much research today now that i'm back home( nov.1,2014.) i believe it was the same spacecraft that was seen in india on october 21, 2014.\r\nsomething is out there. it's studying earth and everything on it indeed.  \r\nthanks for reading my encounter description i feel a little less crazy now, i know what i and the whole crew on the top of the cruise ship deck saw & that was a u.F.O for certain.
