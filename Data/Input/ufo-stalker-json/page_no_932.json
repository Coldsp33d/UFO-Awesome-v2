train traveling by rail leaving osaka, japan.\r\n\r\n2)my wife was looking out of the window and noticed a white yellowish object just hovering in the same spot just above the clouds. it didn't move, looked like it was in the exact same spot.She told me to look and we both stared at it for about 10-15 minutes. \r\n\r\n3)when we first saw it we though maybe a plane (or another type of  aircraft ex.Helicopter), or a comet, or maybe a weather balloon. but it didn't move at all, was just hovering in the same spot just above the clouds.Sometimes the clouds would cover it up but than when the clouds separated a little we would see it again.\r\n4)it looked like a oval shaped, maybe a little closer to circular shaped object. just hovering in the sky. it was just hanging there within the clouds. couldn't of been a star, clearly looks like an object and it was still daylight. \r\n\r\n5)when we first saw it we were like, what is that, than we were trying to figure out all the things it could be and ruled everything out b/c this didnt move at all, just stayed in one place, any other airborne object would do some sort of movement. than we starting to realize what if this is some kind of ufo or classified govt plane no one has seen yet. b/c nothing other than these 2 things could just hang right there with no movement.Plus it looked really big, it must have been a few miles away from us and the size looked significant even from where we were seated.\r\n  \r\n6) we had a real good view of the object, seated right next to the window. we watched it for about 10-15 minutes hovering and every now and than disappearing into the clouds. it would re-appear and disappear. this went on for about 10-15 minutes and finally we lost sight of it in a large cloud that enveloped the object. we still looked on after to see if we could see it, but the cloud didnt move and that area of the sky was totally covered. after about 5 minutes we stopped looking for it as the train starting turning a little bit away from where we were looking. \r\n\r\ni circled it in on of the photos,and in the other photo u can see it hovering in between the power lines in the foreground in the middle of the picture towards the top.","distance":"Over One

were just talking about various things when i noticed a bright light that flashed off and on and each time it reappeared it was further along the shore across the lake. it started under the bridge that led from mercer island to bellevue washington. it went along the bellevue shore line. i said what is that, as the light started coming toward us at a south west angle. he noticed and said i guess a boat. but the light seemed very bright but continued to blink off and on, and as it got closer my boyfriend seemed to go into a trance. i stood up when it was about fifteen or twenty feet from the shore. it was the brightest light i had ever seen but it was under the surface of the water. the light did not refract as would be normal. it remained a circle of bright light. it blinked off and then on one more time very near the shore. i pulled my boyfriend and yelled at him to run. he finally seemed to come out of the trance and we ran as fast as we could. we ran about twenty yards away and turned. the bright orb was sitting on the towel we had left behind.  it was just a bit bigger then the towel about three and one half feet in diameter. we ran all the way to my parents home and told my mother what had happened. oddly enough rather soon after the incident we seemed to have forgotten it entirely. i had an accident about eighteen years ago and the memory came back. i contacted my then ex-husband and asked him if he remembered. he did but was taken aback because he had also forgotten until i asked about it. after i asked he said it was strange that we seemed to forget. we had both been very afraid at the time. i had felt that if we had not run, we would have just not been there. not dead, just not been there anymore. it was as if we were targeted.

watching videos online, and noticed what i thought may have been a bug fly across the screen, although had it been, it would not have been as quick!!Then i thought it had to be a bird or a plane, but it could not be either, as this was almost a light speed even in slow motion. \r\ni have seen plenty of videos. and no bug, plane or otherwise have ever looked quite like this to me.\r\nthis was of a completely different nature, and obviously controlled by some type of intelligence.\r\nnow i have been into the ufo phenomenon for a number of years now, but the day i was watching this i was on no ufo kick or anything of the sort, actually i had other things going on.\r\nbut once i had seen this and realized what i had found knew that it was big, very big!!! \r\nnow i am no video editor or anything of the nature, but i was able to use my movie maker to slow it to .125x speed. the actual speed of video is 1x.\r\nby slowing the video and even pausing at the right moments, i could clearly see that something was actually there. \r\ni have to say this has got to be the best video that i have ever seen and am proud to say i discovered it, as i have believed for a number of years now and those around me thought i was a nut. but the proof is in the pudding.\r\nthis cannot be refuted nor can it be disputed, as there is also sound as this object flies by at supersonic speeds. in the black and white at the end of the video you can see in very good detail the shape and that it has portals or windows, as well as you can see a plume of vapor of some type being emitted from the object in question.\r\nnow i downloaded a software that i have been trying to learn to use and was even able to produce a much slower speed, but was not able to figure out how to do so.\r\nalthough at that slower speed (which object is still fast), you can plainly see it change direction just @ or around the telephone poles.\r\nwhen it came in to view it was at top right corner and exited the screen at an even keel just above the building.\r\ni would like to get this in infared video to see if it emits heat and if so where if not the whole thing. i would also like to see as if it is metallic (chromium) with editing software but do not know how.\r\ni have watched this over and over and am in utter amazement and shock as to what i have found.\r\nthere are rare opportunities like this in a lifetime and i believe this is one of them and this was mine. \r\nit was the needle in the haystack for me, i just wish that needle would have been the megabucks, but am still happy about this as well.\r\nif anyone would like to know more on this i do have the video.","distance":"101-500 Feet, N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

pee break for my two dogs. i always stargaze while waiting for the dogs to finish.  i noticed a very dim orange-ish light in the northern sky out of the corner of my eye.  had i not been already staring up i would never have noticed it. i suppose my brain registered it as a distant plane or something.  it took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust to what i was seeing:  a pitch black (darker than the night sky) isosceles triangle-shaped ship travelling north-to-south right above me.  it doesn't feel like \"flying\" is the right word, it felt more like it was \"gliding\", and i think i say that just because there was zero sound coming from the object, it felt so unnatural and illogical not to be hearing an engine.  were it going slower i might say it was a hang-glider the way it just floated through the air, but the speed of the object was too excessive for that, too fast even for an aeroplane.  it's flight was fast, smooth and constant.  the lights were so very dim that they were difficult to make out unless you were staring straight at it..... the ship's lights wouldn't catch your eye otherwise.  i believe there were 4 lights on each of  the two equal sides of the triangle, though there may have been 5 or 6, i didn't have much time to process those details. \r\ngauging the ship's size is difficult b/c i have no idea how high up it was.  it was certainly large.... maybe over 100 metres... maybe much much larger.\r\nthe ship passed silently above, passing nearly straight over me, roughly north-to-south.  i first locked in to the ship when it was nearly straight above, and had maybe 8 seconds to view it until it passed out of sight in the distance.  \r\nobviously i felt shock for the first  few seconds, and as i processed what i'd just witnessed, i ran inside to tell my wife what i saw.  i should add that i was not under the influence of alcohol or any narcotics, nor was i recently asleep or feeling drowsy.  \r\nit's hard to say how high up the ship was.... based on it's size, speed, and how clear the ship's body was to me, it was in the hundreds of feet high, but that's pure speculation.  the sky was relatively clear so i had no cloud cover to use as a gauge...","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

could see it quite clearly as the street lighting has been upgraded to led lighting. it was raining that night for the first time in a month.As my dog and i got nearer to it i noticed it huddled against the garden wall on the pavement, it looked just like a black ball of around 6 inches in diameter, my  curiosity was aroused as its shape didn't look like a cat, as we got closer about 20 feet or so away from it i thought it will now run and hide under a nearby car which was parked nearby but it stayed where it was, until i got whithin 12 feet or so, at this point it started to roll towards us it then shot up in the air and became about 1 inch in diameter by about 3 feet in length it seemed to hang in the air and then started to spin at enormous speed and then dived down into the pavement and was gone. i was stunned and looked for a hole in the tarmac where it had disappeared but there was no hole there.Whilst it was spinning in front of me i saw coloured rings down its length which gave me the impression of lights on its underside.My dog made no attempt to attack this entity and seemed really quiet afterwards.I conclude that what i had seen was the alien equivalent of our mars rover but much more sophisticated. this sighting has been haunting me ever since invading my thoughts as i sleep.There is a good chance of fracking in this area soon so something my happen

29th 2014 when i heard low flying aircraft and strange humming and buzzing electro magnetic sounds. the lights in my bedroom kept dimming and getting bright. i look out the rear bedroom window toward the south east and south west and observed a strange low flying craft flashing red and white lights and performing strange maneuvers stopping and hovering, circling the area and returning on similar paths. other craft kept appearing out of mid air, no cloud cover, perfect visibility, no sound. the craft would glow bright white and red and seemed to interact with each other. when 2 craft would get close to each other they would slow down, get very bright glowing intense red and white and move around each other in very strange ways. the lights would get intensely bright while moving and hovering then dim out and vanish. after about and hour or more of watching what seemed like a display or show, 2 very high flying aircraft at very high speed passed over head toward the north and one toward the east and seemed to be spraying some type of chemtrail. after 15 minutes i could literally smell a fowl pungent odor and some type of mist was present very briefly. i remember feeling intense heat and then very cold almost mist like but no clouds at all in the sky. perfectly clear night, the sky seemed to get brighter as this continued on for another hour or more. strange sounds like electric humming would start at a low frequency and then speed up as these craft would seem to appear out of the south west marin mountains, hovering and moving irratically then take a straight line path toward the east. this was the most profound ufo experience in my life and im really trying to process what happened last night. 2 of the craft that appeared earlier in the night seemed to sync up in relation to one another but many miles apart and hover continuously the entire time with 3 white orbs in a vertical formation in between the 2 that were synced up? they almost look like stars but would glow intensely bright white and red. i did notice about 3-4 streaks of light, almost like shooting stars that appeared to come off the craft or from the area in the sky they were hovering. like they warped out at high velocity leaving a streak of light. things finally calmed down and they stopped buzzing about around 12:30. i couldn't bring myself in from the window, i was completely amazed and drawn to what i feel was a display or show by these crafts saying look, we are here, look what we can do. it was amazing. finally i did manage to go lay down and try to sleep but very difficult

many colors. after staring at it for about a minute, it quickly jerked to the right then was still again. i grabbed some binoculars but couldn't quite make out a shape, it seemed far away, perhaps closer to the dc area.  i saw a thin white line shoot out from it once.  then noticed very small and faint white lights floating and moving around it. i don't know if those were possibly planes or helicopters from that area observing it or if they were connected.  there were about 20 shooting stars that fell in all directions very close to the main \"star\". the main object would it back and forth, shoot straight up, float downward, and be completely still in between. when it was still, it didn't twinkle as much and would very easily be viewed as a star.  i tried taking pictures and video but my camera doesn't capture any lights at all in the sky. it got brighter when it moved. . i watched it for about 4 hrs as it got smaller as if it was going further away until i lost it among the stars.  3 nights later, i see the same thing only there are 3 large twinkling, \"stars\" with the same movement behavior. they are spread far apart like part of a constellation.  no visible fainter ones that moved this time.  all are still located in the southeastern skies. i'm very curious as to what these are & where exactly they are flying above.
