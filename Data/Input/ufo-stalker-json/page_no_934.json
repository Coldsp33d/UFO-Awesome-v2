across the street.  for some unknown reason i just happened to look up as a long white cylinder object was moving side ways across the sky from north to south.  at first it looked like a cloud or chem-trail because it was white like it was picking up the city lights on the bottom like a cloud would, but it was moving way too fast and maintained its shape the entire time.  there was no noise, vapor trail or anything.\r\n\r\nno more than thirty seconds after i happened to look up again and saw a triangle shaped object, white in front, like there previous object, but angled like a triangle. the middle section was pitch black, because it blocked out the stars as it moved.  it was moving the exact same speed, had no lights, or tangible features like windows, and was absolutely dead silent as well.\r\n\r\na commercial air line came in several moments later as i live in the flight path of the local airport.  these objects were at the same level as a plane coming in for a landing, but they were obviously not planes.  they moved way faster and like i said had no visible lights and made no sound.\r\n\r\nmy reaction to the objects were like, \"whoa ... that's weird.\"  ive been seeing weird lights in the sky here recently that don't blink, they just move steady across the sky, but these had absolutely no lights and could have moved over easily without me evening knowing had i not looked up.\r\n\r\ni have always been fascinated with this subject and have seen lights before, but this was way different.  when you see a light, that's generally all you see, but these had shape and appeared solid.\r\n\r\nseveral weeks before this i also witnessed what looked like a long chem-trail moving sideways across the sky.  i only realized it was moving because when i first saw it it was on one side of the moon and then a few minutes later it was on the other side and i watched it from there.  i realize it could have been high winds moving it, but at no point did it change shape or

around 9:00pm, i had my girlfriend and her two children.  the boy 4 years old and the girl 9 years old.  i was heading to get some wine from the liquor store for christmas dinner a few days away.  we all saw the object.\r\n\r\nwhen pulling into the parking lot of goody goody liquor, in colleyville, i noticed an object to the north.  at this point the object was so close it seemed to be about 200 feet directly above my truck.  before going into the liquor store, we all got out of the truck and stared at this object for about 20 minutes.  it was moving very slowly to the northwest and seemed to be dripping what l can only describe as molten metal or plasma.  it traveled on a slow pace and in one direction for about 5 minutes until our eyes adjusted to the night.  there was very little light pollution in this area, at this time.  once our eyes adjusted we could see multiple objects, similar in shape and activity, in the distance (to the north).  i'd have to estimate that there was at least 6 -10 similar objects.  when focusing the camera on the initial sighting, the one shown in the video, the other objects eventually disappeared. (we didn't see them anymore, but we did not see them actually leave)  \r\n\r\nthe kids were frightened and the 9 year old said that she was scared.  i had to lie to her and tell her that it was probably santa claus, and that there was nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\ncontinuing from about 10 minutes into the sighting, after the other objects vanished, we watched it move more into the distance, still making the same abrupt turns, going about the same speed, never stopping to hover, and still dripping the \"metal\".  the store was going to close soon, so i went in quickly, made my purchase, and basically ran back out to the truck where the other 3 witnesses still stood, staring at the object.  this is roughly about 20 minutes into the sighting.\r\n\r\nafter about 20 minutes, we noticed a new ball of light directly above the truck, making erratic movements and not dripping the metal as much (if at all).  it seemed roughly  200 feet above the truck.  this was the most disturbing of the sightings (not caught on film).  it was closer, more detailed, and more strange than the other sightings.  it was making movements that are obviously not of any conventional craft i'm aware of.  large, spherical shaped and emitting it's own light. it traveled slowly to the northwest, and this went on for about 10 minutes.  until, finally, my girlfriend made it known that we needed to get the kids out of there, and that it was late and they were getting freaked out.  we left, as the \"craft\" was still in plain sight.  (a huge regret of mine)  we never checked back with the initial sighting...\r\n\r\nvideo:  you'll see in these 2 clips, the same \"craft\".  this will be the first sighting.  this video was taken roughly 3-5 minutes within first noticing the object.  (video 1 = 29 secs, video 2 = 10 secs) keep in mind...The abrupt motion in the first video is me, and not the object.  i was trying to film the other objects...You can clearly make a second object out in the first video at the bottom of the screen, about midway into the video.\r\n\r\ni would really like to know if there are any similar sightings of this type, or sightings in the same area.  if there are any questions, i'd be happy to answer them by phone or email.  \r\n\r\n[name removed/cms/dr]","distance":"501 Feet - 1

out for one last smoke for the night before heading to bed.  we smoke every night around 10pm and 1:00 and are aware of all the flight paths and emergency flight vehicles that pass through on a regular basis over our home.  i was the first to notice the ufo.  i must have watched it for about two minutes or so when i realized that it was not a satellite because of the speed it was going.  i pointed it out to my friend and he started to pay attention to it as well.  it was going twice as fast as the airplanes that come through to seattle/tacoma international airport but still looked like a 'star' as we called it.  it was much brighter than all the rest and very perfectly circular.  it seemed to radiate or glow and got softer on the edges.  i do struggle some with eyesight at night, so i was asking him if he was seeing exactly what i was seeing and he confirmed.  we watched it go straight, but very fast from the nw to n.  it slowed down some in speed and went behind the only cloud out that night.  it then zipped out quickly so we could see it, then immediately went back to hiding in the cloud.  it went back and forth in a matter of what seemed liked seconds to us.  it did this one more time.  we saw it race out of the cloud hiding and go back and forth 4 times.  at this point, i began to shake a little from excitement.  we did try to video with our phone, but we could not get it in the view of our phones which do need to be upgraded.  (razor slim andriod).  it then proceeded to slowly come out of the cloud hiding and move very slow, like a satellite at this point.  however we knew it was not a satellite at this point.  shortly after it came out of the cloud hiding, we saw a normal plane pass by which was probably the one red eye flight we see each night that passes by.  the plane was down lower than the ufo at this point.  the ufo had moved up even higher and now had stopped near what was a star.  it stayed stationary for about 20 minutes.  we continued to stare.  we stared so much that i stopped staring at it and we joked that 'they' needed to do their paperwork before returning home, and then suddenly it started to move again and headed east.  it was moving fast again, like it did in the very beginning.  it headed east as if it was headed to cross the snoqualmie mountain pass region.  we watched it until we couldn't see it anymore and it disappeared.  i was already a believer, but this was my first ufo sighting ever.  this also made a firm believe out of my best friend who did not believe before.
