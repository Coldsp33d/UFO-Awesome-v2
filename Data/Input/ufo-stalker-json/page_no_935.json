[goosebumps]\r\n\r\ni'm always taking pictures of the sunsets or sunrises.  ive got some other pictures that have questionable orbs or lights in them: but i always dismissed it.  now i'll pay more attention; and i'll be looking at pictures of the past.\r\n\r\ni will add, i went to a conference in june {discussing ufo's and more}.  while there i met a man that claims to have been abducted, and claims to have an implant.{i believe him} he lives in another state, but we have stayed in contact with each other.  well, sort of.  after a few emails and phone conversations, it's like he fell off the planet.  then oct 17, i get an email from him apologizing for not staying in touch.  {he had a horrific few months}.  he was concerned that the \"beings\" would try to come after me. then i emailed him back, several times before that mon 20th {when i saw this boomerang}.  this was his work email so he didn't even read them until after the fact.\r\n \r\nsee, he accepted jesus christ the weekend of the conference. he told me and my friend about his abduction at 13: his x-ray of a broken foot and the implant.  he is now in his 60's.  he has only told a select few about his 'situation'.  \r\nthese 'beings' came back for him, trying to convince him that \"no amount of praying would do any good\".  since he is new to christ, he believed them. they are liars from the pit of hell.  persons that are being tormented by these beings can find hope in jesus,  they [the beings] fear him [jesus].\r\n\r\nso, it might be like my friend said, they want to come after me.  they might give me the creeps but, i've got a more powerful weapon.  jesus!","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

trying to avoid something and thought that was weird and then i noticed what it was trying to avoid. a low flying large v shaped craft flying from the south west to the north east with 3 bright and large lights on the under side of the craft the one light at the front of the v was a little smaller than the other 2 and i would say they were placed about the mid point rather than at the back of craft at the points. it never deviated from its path going along at a fairly good clip from the time that i saw it break cover from the building that was blocking it from my view till i lost it was about 40 sec. no more than a min. i live down town just on the east side of the high rise building so i get a fairly good view on clear nights being able to make out orion, mars, and a few other

a glass to pour a soda for my wife. i looked up and out of the kitchen window that is directly behind the sink. i often do this to watch the commercial flights come in while i am doing dishes. as i looked up i first noticed a plane with its typical flashing lights pass by on the usual eastward flight path, coming in for a landing at the ft. lauderdale intl airport. i have seen this many, many times before. then just as the plane went out of sight behind the trees, a light blinked on in the west and caught my eye. i watched it flash 3-4 more times, with about a one second interval, give or take few tenths, although it was definitely the same interval between each blink/flash. it was almost like a light on a plane or helicopter being controlled digitally. i even thought at first that it was a plane on the westward approach, which is further out in the distance than the eastward approach, but the light appeared to be in the middle somewhere, where no planes should be. it also seemed too high in elevation to be a helicopter. i watched that same point in the sky for at least 30 more seconds after the last blink before taking my eyes away. it never reappeared there or anywhere in sight. i immediately checked my phone and noted the time to be 9:41 eastern standard time. i then ran out to the back patio without even pouring the drink, to tell my wife what i had just witnessed. i know it's not much. i have no photo evidence or other witnesses to back me up, but i am sure of what i saw. thank you for everything do. i hope to hear back.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

driveway, a huge and very bright red ball in the sky caught my eye.  it went off as soon as i saw it, then reappeared and stayed lit and motionless for about 5 secs before \"turning off.\"  a few seconds after that there were two white blinking lights in tandem to each other heading from east to west.  there were some cloudiness tonight and the two lights seemed to go above the clouds.  my dad saw the red ball too, we discussed for a moment and looked at those blinking lights as they headed above the clouds.  everything seemed calm.  on my way back to town i notice the two lights again...They were heading east now.  right behind a brighter orange-reddish light took the center stage.  my wife and i said \"how weird\"...And really didn't think anything about it.  part of the road we were driving on had trees that obscured our viewing angle for a short time.  we made a turn and now had a field adjacent to us.  we had full vision of the area again.  our hearts sank.  we saw 6 of the very bright red balls lined up.  not perfectly straight..But kind of like an edge of a bowl.  it spanned several miles across.  they went out almost simultaneously then we could see everything else going in the sky.  there were at least 15 different flashing lights in the sky now.  it wasn't a constant flashing..But more like a fading in and out.  a few did flash tho.  you could follow a light and see it turning abruptly.  it almost appeared too they were going in a big circle.  during this time, numerous other red balls of lights were appearing randomly across the sky.  i got on the phone with my parents now just north of my new viewing area and they were seeing the same thing.  it was scary.  we were literally parked in the middle of a dark road looking at all this.  we knew we could sit here all night.  i debated on calling the county dispatch..Or even calling the news in san angelo, tx about it.  i figured other people are undoubtedly seeing this and would call this in.  to me, there was so much activity in the sky it almost looked like a mini war up there.  we left when the activity still on going.  as we pulled up to our house and got out of the car i could here jets going by.  definitely something strange was going on tonight.","distance":"Over One

it was so bright and changing colors from red to blue to white as we were standing there observing the colored object a bright white light suddenly flickered into veiw below the object and became very bright,we all said some explatives when it suddenly started moving off from a stationary position under the object we were watching..This light glided of going south until it disappeared in the night sky,,this however is not what made me decide to file a report, as we were walking back toward my apt still in awe of what we had seen and looking at the night sky as we walked i saw something that confused my sense of reality? so to speak...What we saw was a large group of very dull lights gliding over head in a loose v formation..I have seen many strange lights in the sky but never have i seen anything like this,they looked about as bright as what a dying glow stick would look like, there were maybe ten to twelve of them. if you were not already looking at the sky it would not have been seen they were that dull but glided past very fast, about ten seconds later from the other direction we again saw three dull orb like lights silently glide over head in the other direction towards the adirondacks.. also as a side note,,the amount of low flying aircraft in the sky tonight was unbelievable and i would like to mention that if we did not know better it seemed like these aircraft were there to hide what ever is going on in the night sky, i live less than ten miles from the albany airport so aircraft in the sky is a normal sight but what got our attention was the strobing lights these planes and helicopters were flashing. after we got back as we were standing in the yard the last thing we saw before going inside was what i can only describe as a bright pinpoint of light extremley high up just smoothly gliding across the sky going from east to west.It did not look like a satalite this thing was to bright.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

red, green, yellow, white.  it appeared to be one object.  then the object/lights would ascend and descend, and move side to side but always staying within its general area.  i looked at it through a set of binoculars and i witnessed the colored lights were more definitively round and they flashed on and off in almost a pattern.  i saw three different planes traverse my view horizon as it related to the lights.  i knew they were planes with their distinctive flashing plane-like lights and they were going in a straight horizontal direction.  i was glad i was able to compare known flying objects (the planes) with something that didn't register as something i was familiar with.  at one point i said aloud to the light source, \"you have no interest in me anymore, do you?\"  i have had my own curiosities/experiences from childhood to early adulthood that are questionable and unresolved.   my partner and i watched it for about a half hour and stopped watching it altogther.  then in a cavalier way, we both said to each other, \"ok it’s a ufo and does it really matter anymore?\"  observing this ufo was our experience and we have no recourse to tell our story expect maybe here.  so, there was this resignation that fell on us.  we both agreed this sighting is not unlike others we’ve heard about, and this will continue.  so now what?  unless humankind is in a big petri dish and we have no control in this manner or setup, then does it matter anymore?  the world has seen ufos like forever, we’ve seen crop circles pop up worldwide for some time, we hear about underwater activity that can’t be explained, and like many other people i’ve had my own visits at night with the mysterious owl when i was a kid.  i would think it would be great to have global conscious contact with these unknowns but maybe it’s never meant to be or not be right now.  maybe humankind will have this available to us to in about a thousand more years?  thank you for allowing this forum to be here to give my account of this ufo observation.

when to the west my wife and i both noticed several unusual objects in the sky. at first glance they looked like very short contrails but as we continued to observe them we noticed that they were stationary and not becoming longer like a contrail. i was driving and had to pay attention to the road but my wife says she counted 9 of these disc shaped objects before they disappeared one at a time.  by the time she took pictures only two remained. i think in a couple of the pictures there are three of them.\r\n\r\nnot only did we see these objects to the west but we both saw one blinking orange star like object which was roughly to the south of our position at approximately 45 degrees (just taking a guess on that). i saw this object looking out the driver’s side window while still traveling westbound. it looked a lot like a very bright mars but i am certain it was not a planet or an airplane. it was not quite dark yet and no stars were visible at that time. it was unlike anything i have seen in the sky before. i looked at it and it disappeared. it did not blink like an airplane and i wouldn't exactly say it pulsated. it was more like a slow steady blink with roughly 10-15 seconds between blinks until it just disappeared. it seemed stationary and i definitely believe it was in our atmosphere and not in space. i feel that the star like object was closer to us but it is very hard to tell.\r\n\r\ni consider myself a logical minded person and try not to jump to conclusions so i will say i have no idea exactly what these objects were but to see the unusual objects to the west and then the one to the south within a few minutes of each other was very intriguing. now i only wish i would have pulled over to get more/better pictures especially of the star like object.\r\n\r\ni firmly believe we are not alone in the universe but cannot say i have any evidence.  my wife is more of a skeptic and after this event i asked her if she believes we are alone after witnessing these objects she replied with a firm, \"no\". she said it was, \"creepy\". i don't know if these objects originate on this planet or from somewhere else but i do know that they were undoubtedly unusual.\r\n\r\npersonally i felt excited to witness something like this. i am curious to know what these objects are and from where they originate.\r\n\r\ni am attaching the original unedited photos.  i apologize for the quality as they are iphone photos through the windshield of a moving vehicle. these are the photos of the remaining objects to the west. keep in mind that there were nine of these according to my wife and they disappeared one at a time. when i zoomed in on them (picture number 8 specifically) i was amazed to see that classic ufo shape. the star like object

was out side waiting with grandson for his mother to pick him up, and as i'm always looking up saw what appeared to be a plane with trail it looked odd to me it was more like a half circle not the shape of a plane and 1 trail coming from it, the evening light was shinning on it which made it look pink like. so i took photo of it with iphone. when i zoomed in in iphoto was quite thrilled with what i saw, would you believe nobody else was!  it just went from one side of sky to another, just kept on going ( away from sydney airport which i live near ) some months previous not sure when i noticed when i was at my old home and sitting outside on balcony round about 5pm again something else odd so took video, and ran to back of house as it flew over to film it some more, but it didn't appear !! although i have it on my computer. now i will say that back in the 60's i did see something else odd that didn't fit, and that was it, i'm a believer. i go much deeper than most people, am spiritual too, with eyes wide open. have access to apple tv so i am looking all the time on youtube for ufo like mine. i get disappointed with most channels who also go into conspiracies, etc., then i saw your stuff, ah i said thats for me. if you don't mind an opinion, i would like to air one, there is evidence every where that we where visited long ago, its so obvious that everything that was left in stone was not from primitive man, it all says we where here. then the crop circles, phenomena yes but oh so intelligent, we are used to them now, next is escalating sightings and proof of, and now weather phenomenon, clouds etc, saying look what we can do, look up! \r\non a recent visit to my son in queensland country i sat outside (with no light pollution ) looking at the stars,( can't see them that clear where i live) after an hour was going indoors when i saw coloured lights 2 lots blinking oh great i thought 2 planes it was 2.30am when i told my son as a joke he informed me that planes aren't allowed to fly at that time !!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

orange color. within a few seconds it almost appeared to open like an egg cracking open and in the center there was a red orb and the hazy orange color surrounded it. then it was almost as if it closed and went back to all orange and then it just vanished. i continued to watch and had my brother looking up with me to see if the light returned, thinking maybe it was a plane light or a satelite but the light never returned. it all happened within a matter of seconds and i even started to question whether something had exploded extremely high in the sky. i notified the american meteorlogic

that's when i noticed a bluish object hovering in the sky that intensified in brightness as i watched.\r\n i quickly drop my groceries and reach for my cell phone and started recording it. while i was recording i noticed a couple of small white lights blinking & were heading towards the blue object. when the first one got close it started moving away eastwardly and when one got very close to it, it just winked out.\r\n the smaller white blinking objects kept heading east in the direction the blue thing was going & on my way home i saw two more blinking lights going towards the east in the same area.\r\n i believe the small blinking lights were fighters because of their speed but for some reason i couldn t hear a sound coming from them. they could have been higher than i thought but i don't believe so. you can see on the video how far away they were. the sound you hear on the video is from the highway not the objects.\r\n the objects were almost directly above the football stadium over in the north part of town and i question some people from the game and they said they heard nothing and saw nothing. it seems that if they were some type of conventional aircraft they would have definitely heard them. somebody would have heard them.\r\n if you take a close look at the video and zoom in and look around you'll see that there is a blinking object coming from the north, which is the direction i'm facing, and you'll definitely see the one that closes in & comes right up to the object as it is heading east and vanishes. they were either checking it out or part of its entourage.\r\n we have an air force base over in altus about 45 miles from here but they house galaxy class transport planes (c-5s). i've never seen any fighters from there and i've never seen them escort anything before like this. i'vsouthwest oklahoma and its wide open territory where they test things i just another of the oddities of southwest oklahoma and its wide open territory where they test things i believe.From the red river south of us to i-40 north of us which, covers about 70 miles or so, there is nothing but complete barren territory. they could pretty much start another \"area 51\" here. lol but seriously people do see a lot of strange things around here day and night. my youtube site is \"paladone101\" if you want to see some of my other sightings. the one about the cylindrical ufo i already reported to you guys. i see a lot of things here but they're usually too fast for me to get on video and it's hard to make people believe you if you don't have proof.\r\n if i'm forgetting anything or leave something out or you need more information let me know you got my number. \r\n this is the second time i reported this because i believe my first report eariler today didn't go through because of bad connection if it did i'm sorry.\r\n    later!","distance":"101-500

a few odd orb-shaped objects in the last few weeks (they appear to be dim stars but with sudden flashbulb effect and then sudden movement, with extreme-angle changes in flight path/rate of travel)\r\nearlier this evening i saw what was probably a communications satellite traveling due-south/due-north with no variance in course or rate of travel, but on this sighting i was just about to go back inside when i looked to the east and saw a very large triangular shape moving at very high rate, but just an outline, as if it were cloaked or transparent, it quickly disappeared behind very thin upper-atmosphere cloud cover heading southeast. i had an experience as a small child (about 5 yrs old)that involved a very large craft (like an upside-down aircraft carrier at very low altitude, and two military aircraft tracking, at the time i had the overwhelming sense that time had been suspended and i wasn't supposed to be seeing what i saw, it was as if the craft had entered through a dimensional/time(?) porthole, and the military jets i saw hadn't been invented in 1956 when this occurred, it took me over 50 yrs to finally tell someone about it because i thought nobody would ever believe me.. but this latest sighting really freaked me out. it wasn't a plane, i've lived within 10-12 miles of both midway & o'hare airports for 63 yrs ...I know a airplane or helicopter when i see
