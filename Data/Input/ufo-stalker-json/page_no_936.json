it was what looked like a sort of triangular ovoid that was emitting flames in all directions.\r\n\r\ni pointed it out to the person in the passenger seat.\r\n\r\nthey tried to get a picture, but

gave my sons friend my number and asked him to call me. several nights later i got a call. i drove from arvada co to golden co. about 20 min.I was told to wait. my son's friend dalton told me \"there!\" and points up. in the southwestern shy i see an object. it appears to be moving about 35 mph in relation to the ground. it appears to be a cluster or \"stack\" of objects in a group. i will describe as best i can. in the light available, the objects appear translucent or transparent. this object appears to be 500-1000 feet above me. it is absolutely silent and moving in a distinct, predictable path to my left as i face south. first heading east, then a slow turn to the north, flying right over my head. the object seems see-thru. it looks like a stack of plastic cups in a way. if you got say 10-15 clear plastic cups, laid them on their sides and took the bottom out of them and staked them on top of each other and pushed the stack through the air. the stack does not stay in perfect formation either. some of the stack move forward and back as separate parts. this all happens silently right overhead. i have seen several of them between the time of 7:30 and 9:30 on this date. some formations are large consisting of as many of 30 or more of these small objects inside and travel through the air in a slight partial curve making a kind of 3d leading edge made up of the parts as the single parts move forward and back from the formation. there is most certainly light emitting from these objects. it's impossible to tell if the light being seen from these objects is reflected or created by them. that is because of their translucent nature. i suspect the light is reflected by these objects because they can't be seen at all unless you are in a particular part of the mountainside we were on with lighting from a large building complex nearby. i saw at least two of these objects in the sky at once. at one time two of these passed right over my head with one above the other in opposite directions. i also witnessed one of these clearly under intelligent control make a very well-steered tour of the night sky covering my entire view as i blocked the light from a street light with my hand. i realize people are going to think i'm some nut. i wouldn't do this if i had any idea what these things are. i might add that i'm still not sure about the cup shape. when i got one of my better looks at these things, it almost appeared the stack was made up of rectangular shapes made of square shapes all exactly the same size and shape with tiny spots of light being either reflected of emitted from these objects seemingly in the same spot on each. i know this sounds crazy and i bet i blew the description, but i'll draw them also. i have 3 other people beside me that will absolutely swear to this including me. i am willing to show these objects to anyone who will listen. i am not joking about these. this is very much real and frankly, i'm very upset because i can't understand this.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

to my left dead east a pulsing red-orange and blue light about 20 degrees off the horizon out toward the air field. i thought to myself \"hmmm, now what is that?\" it wasn't like any plane i had seen before. thinking it might be a planet i tried to get it on my camera phone, (usually i cant get any light past a quarter mile on my phone in the dark) the first object registered on my phone so i took some pictures trying to use the street light as a reference. then there was a meteor shower of about 5 to 7 streaks of light just over my head, i happened to look up, while i was scanning the sky looking for an explanation of this object. i went inside to get my sister in-law who was still up to come out and see this weird thing. she came out and observed the object with my wife their other sister and my mother in-law. as they all went back inside out of fear/and an unwillingness to be out in the dark and cold i stood and watch the object for another 20 min i decided to look up on my phone where the planets where and according to the internet they would have been behind me in the west, so i set my camera to video and recorded the object some more. while i was scanning the neighborhood i notice a second light to the south east over my friends house. it too was moving in a slow wobbly vertical motion flashing none standard aviation colors. in total i have several pictures and 3 videos. unfortunately my phone is dead, i have it on a charger but i cannot submit the photos or videos at this moment in

was looking up at the stars because the sky was extremely clear. i noticed light streaking across the sky in the corner of my right eye. i looked over and saw lights in a v-formation with several lights to the side that were in no particular pattern. the lights appeared to be the size and distance of airplane lights. the lights were moving very smoothly across the sky in a straight path. the lights stayed equidistant and locked in formation with each other for the duration of my sighting. the lights then disappeared behind a tree and then behind spartan stadium. if the lights were at the same altitude as airplanes, they would have been moving extremely fast. i immediately pulled out my headphones and i heard no sounds coming from the lights. the area around me on ground level was quiet.I had a small turf field with stadium lights to my left and a large set of fields with stadium lights to my right. beyond the field to my left was spartan stadium.\r\n\r\nextra info:\r\nthe v part of the formation appeared to be much sharper than the v formation in the phoenix lights.\r\ni believe the v-formation was comprised of more than 5 lights; although i am not really sure.\r\n\r\nmy explanation: a few seconds after the \"lights\" disappeared, i began to think \"how?\" and \"what?\". my theory is that it was a small flock of birds. the stadium lights that surrounded me could have reflected off of the underbelly of the birds, explaining why i could see them against the night sky. i believe the birds would have been brownish, but i can not speculate on size. the relative size of the \"lights\" and the speed would have made sense. i did not, however, see wings flapping.\r\n\r\nmy view on ufos: i am a strong believer in science and statistics, and i understand that alien life most probably does exist. that is exciting to me. however, i do not personally believe there is evidence that alien life has visited modern day earth. i think that most all ufo sightings are explainable.\r\n\r\nside note: there was once a few years ago when i saw something thats behavior i still cannot explain. this lack of explanation bothers

there is no clouds since its so beautiful in the country with no city lights.  i saw a couple airplanes as i sat and brushed off my excess hair and as i went from looking straight up i looked more towards the south and saw a white light moving very fast.  i dont know how high it was but i suspect it was very very high.  it changed direction towards the east on a dime and made a zig zag type of move the only thing that came into my head was like barry sanders running around but it zig zagged so fast it felt like my mind took a minute to catch up. it then either broke into 3 total spheres or lights that started to dance around each other.  right before it broke off it went from a white/blue type color and changed a bunch of colors in a split second but i do remember a flash of purple green and some kind of beautiful blue. when they danced around still flying and moving about very fast they changed colors but the faster they \"danced\" the more the colors changed and when they werent moving as much colors still pulsed but it was slower.  the colors i mostly saw were a mix of white, purples and violets, and blues and greens. mostly purples and blues. im not sure exactly how long this happened since i just stood there in awe watching it.  but they headed north/north east and looked like the 3 orbs went back into one and then instantly lost view of it.  on a seperate note dogs and coyotes about 10 min later all around the area were howling which was odd but didnt even think about it meaning anything until i wrote this.  the feeling i got while watching this i was not scared or anything bad, i felt at peace and felt beauty like i was watching a famous artist paint.","distance":"Unknown,
