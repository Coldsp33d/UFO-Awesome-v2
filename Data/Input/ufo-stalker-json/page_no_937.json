for too many details from her regarding a sighting she had if a radar in a crop field  and then a confrontation followed with mib agents that and i quote \"came out of nowhere. all i remember is that she had come to some sort of dead end in a corn field while lost on her way back from work going home. i can't ask her the exact location anymore because she is obviously deceased. i guess i should also mention that she only came forward with this story while we were talking about ufos together and she seemed genuinely frightened. it took her around twenty years to tell anyone this story at all. she got very tense whenever i would bring it up to talk about it. again, my proof to you that this was a very intimidating and scary experience for her. back to the story: she was on her way home when she came across a dead end near a crop type of field. before turning around the vehicle she noticed a pulsating light and rotating radar type of machine that had the grass perfectly cut out from underneath it. some sort of machine, from what she observed at that time. she said to herself something along the lines of \"what on earth is that\". she then looked up and saw a black suv, that \"came out of absolutely nowhere\". they warned her that she should jot be in this area and that she needed to leave. she tried explaining that she was only lost and they cut her off and gave her very quick and concise directions to get away from the vicinity. these men in black as she described them were very pale, we're wearing sunglasses, and had black suits on. again this is all going off of the memory i have of my mom telling me the story. they had no identification whatsoever which really baffles me. if they were government why didn't they identify what agency they were from? all these questions are still weighing very heavily on me. i wish i could have asked her more about this story but she just seemed so frightened whenever i would bring it up so i learned to avoid it, she was also afraid no one would believe her. please, if you guys can investigate this further for me. any sightings similar to this please forward to me immediately. thank you for your time reading my report. do not hesitate to contact me at 630-699-4842, if you have any further follow up questions regarding my story. \r\n\r\nvictor de la cruz\r\nlombard il. 60148\r\n19 years old","distance":"20

a pilot on the 747-8 freighter, i flew a regular flight between hongkong and anchorage on august 24th.\r\nafter about 5 hours in flight we left japan behind us and were cruising at a comfortable 34.000ft with about 4,5 hours to go towards alaska. \r\nwe heard via the radio and other aircraft about earthquakes in iceland, chile and san francisco, and since there were a few volcanos on our route that might or might not be going off during our flight, we double checked with dispatch if there was any new activity on our route after we departed from hongkong. \r\nthen, very far in the distance ahead of us, just over the horizon an intense light flash shot up from the ground. it looked like a lightning bolt, but way more intense and directed vertically up in the air. i have never seen anything like this, and there were no flashes before or after this single explosion of light. \r\nsince there were no thunderstorms on our route or weather-radar, we kept a close lookout for possible storms that might be hiding from our radar and might cause some problems later on. \r\n\r\ni decided to try and take some pictures of the night sky and the strange green glow that was all over the northern hemisphere. i think it was sort of a northern lights but it was much more dispersed, never seen anything like this before either. probably a typical green 'earth glow', that is related to the northern lights due to the electromagnetic field around the earth being influenced by the solar storm of the last week.\r\nabout 20 minutes later in flight i noticed a deep red/orange glow appearing ahead of us, and this was a bit strange since there was supposed to be nothing but endless ocean below us for hundreds of miles around us. a distant city or group of typical asian squid-fishing-boats would not make sense in this area, apart from the fact that the lights we saw were much larger in size and glowed red/orange, instead of the normal yellow and white that cities or ships would produce. \r\nthe closer we got, the more intense the glow became, illuminating the clouds and sky below us in a scary orange glow. in a part of the world where there was supposed to be nothing but water. \r\n\r\nsince the nearest possible airport was at least 2 hours flying away, and the idea of flying into a highly dangerous and invisible ash-plume in the middle of the night over the vast pacific ocean we felt not exactly happy. fortunately we did not encounter anything like an ash cloud, but together with the very creepy unexplainable deep red/orange glow from the ocean's surface, we felt everything but comfortable. there was also no other traffic near our position or on the same routing to confirm anything of what we saw or confirm any type of ash clouds encountered. \r\n\r\nwe reported our observations to air traffic control but we were the only ones who saw the lights that night.\r\n- three independent lightning-observing agencies have confirmed that there were no electrical dischargers that night 3 hours before and after the observed lightning flash, and not in a radius of at least 500km/250nm of the observed flash. thus very unlikely that it was a lightning strike.\r\n\r\n- no seismic activity in that part of the ocean measured, this area is not seismically active since the last 10.000 years so a volcano is unlikely.\r\n\r\n- possible russian naval rocket test or salvage operation since its close to petropavlovsk, home of the russian pacific submarine fleet.\r\n- days later the russians have closed the airspace north of this location because with the official announcement of rocket/weapon tests.\r\n\r\n- red lights are normally not used for fishing, so a fishing fleet is not likely. white/green lights are used for fishing, and from smaller sources since ships are not that large.\r\n\r\n- individual lights were about 100-300 meters (300-1000ft) in diameter, the total cluster/group of lights about 30km / 20 miles in diameter.\r\n- lights did not appear to move, flicker or change intensity. \r\n- no abnormalities in navigation equipment, on board systems, radios or gps-data.\r\n- lights were extremely bright, so bright that they even illuminated the clouds around us and were visible for a good 300km distance.\r\n\r\n- we were the only two persons on board, since we flew a cargo plane. no other aircraft in the vicinity, nearest aircraft was about 1800km further away.\r\n- airport of petropavlovsk (enroute alternate) was closed due to maintenance.\r\n\r\n- added is a photo for comparison; we overflew the city of winnipeg a few days later. the city of winnipeg is about 25km wide from any angle, it shows the relative size of the patch of lights we saw. \r\n\r\n- camera used; nikon d800. lens; nikkor 10.5mm fisheye f/2.8. all manual settings are visible on the photos.","distance":"Over One

double and then triple the space above the plane. after the plane passed, it came back down. it is now (1:40 am) hovering just above the ridge. i am between grafton and morgantown on rt 119. the ufo
