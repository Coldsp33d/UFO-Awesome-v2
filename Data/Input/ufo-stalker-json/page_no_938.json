excited and kept telling me he had seen something, a huge owl in an old dilapidated barn located across us 50 which was undergoing some construction at the time.  a new widened section with a new bridge was being built.  he was acting strange and agitated telling me he wanted me to see the owl.  we walked across a fallow farm field that was uncultivated and wild with weeds and undergrowth.  we went in the barn and he kept saying how amazing the owl was!  as we entered the barn he began pointing excitedly to a cross beam strut maybe 20 or 30 feet above the barn floor.  when it was obvious that the owl wasn't there, he seemed to be confused and disoriented and kept telling me about how beautiful the owl was.  we stood in there maybe 5 or 10 minutes while he tried to tell me about his encounter.  we returned home and my grandmother, his mother was preparing a meal.  it was like he completely forgot about the event.  i remember asking him sometime later about the owl and it was like it never happened.\r\nthe reason i chose to write this report was years later i saw a very large object in the dark of what appeared to be a very large owl resting up in a tree at night.  suddenly the bird or winged creature descended down out of the branches of a tree adjacent to buffalo bayou in houston on a property our group was leasing for a men's association dedicated to exploring many issues men face in a changing social environment since the women's lib movement began in the 60's.  this was about 1993 or 1994.  something jogged my memory about these two events and their possible

working at harvesting alfalfa hay during a 12 hour night shift.  we worked 7 days a week, starting at 6 in the evening and ending 6 in the morning.  driving an open tractor (no cab, no windows) every night, we had complete vision of the night sky every night for 3 months in the summer.  i had seen many things i could not explain, lots of green lights coming from the ground into the night sky like exploding electrical transformers, but they would come and go and not think much about them, sometimes we would see light rays like search lights, but again, unexplainable but no big deal, we also saw many, many meteorties. \r\n\r\n but this night was a real freak out deal.  i was staning on top of a large piece of machinery (tall covered hay trailer) scooping off the hay that had blown onto the lid of this covered hay trailer, and as i was pitching the hay off the top onto the ground below and swinging the pitch fork up in the air, my eyes caught a bright large shimmering metallic object off to the north, maybe 25 degrees off the horizon from my viewpoint.  it wasn't very high off the ground, maybe 1,000'  i watched it momentarily then hollered at my 2 friends down on the ground.  i was elevated on top of the trailer about 15' high.  as i pointed at the object and hollered at them to \"look at that\", we all watched this cigar shaped shimmering object maybe only 1-2 miles away. judging from the size of it, it was close enough to hear propulsion noise if it was a conventional manmade aircraft, but it made none. the sun was starting to light the sky from the east and the stars were growing dimmer and we could see the surface was shimmering like an aluminum jet airliner reflecting the early light of day, the object was so illuminated it seemed like it was 3 times as large as a jetliner fuselage with no wings or tail.  it had blinking lights and darker areas that would seem like windows.  the entire fuselage would change colors from greens to blues to silver.  the spectacular thing was that it hovered for some time, but then when it started to move, it darted, then stopped, then changed direction in a completely different direction as if it was drawing the number \"4\" in the dark sky about as fast as zorro would swipe his sword, then it sped off into the distance directly away from us at a speed so fast it merely vanished out of sight. we vowed nobody would believe us, and we weren't going to talk about it, but the next day the local newspaper was alive with headlines of stories of people seeing this exact same thing across the state across a distance of 200-300 miles.  we know it was ufo, nothing else this large can move eradically across the sky, and speed away so fast.  i have shared this story with all my believing friends. it burned a visual in my mind that will never be erased.  too unbelievable, but seeing is believing.

illinois around 11 pm at night. we pulled off into a backroad that was tucked away in a somewhat open valley, surrounded by trees on all sides. as we were cruising around and talking (driving east), we noticed a very odd light in the sky (the sky was also very clear) that was just over the treetops in the distance, thinking it was a cell tower. we realized very quickly that there was not a cell tower in that direction whatsoever. at this point, we assumed we were either looking at a helicopter or some sort of commercial aircraft that was flying west. we got out of the car to watch it, and shortly after, the light, which began to blink and pulsate, dispersed into 8-10 smaller lights. my friend and i had no idea what to think at this point.\r\n\r\neach light had a very light-bluish and whitish coloration. they all blinked with no apparent pattern whatsoever, and were also not in any organized formation of sorts upon dispersion. also, as each light blinked randomly, there seemed to be some sort of \"aura\" that pulsated about it, in a much more rich color than the light that was blinking. another interesting thing to note was that each of these lights \"danced\" around within a circle vicinity as they blinked and pulsated. there was absolutely no sound heard.\r\n\r\nwe pretty much ruled out commercial aircraft after these events. the lights continued this same behavior for close to 10 minutes, then all but one of the lights began to move, though they continued in the same movement pattern - dancing around in a circle while pulsating and blinking. all but one of the lights disappeared behind the treetops, and we did not see them again. there was one light left, still blinking and pulsating. we realized that this was the biggest light out of all of them. it continued this behavior for another solid minute, then suddenly the shape of the light sort of \"flatlined.\"  it turned into a straight light, then moved in the night sky what had to of been a few miles within a second. it turned from this circular, starlike shape to a straight line, and zipped from one area to another in a second, then returned to its original form and behavior. almost directly after this, we noticed that it was getting brighter and appeared to be moving in our direction, so we decided to leave. unfortunately, due to the fact that we only had our iphones on us and no type of complex camera (night vision, etc.), we were not able to capture these lights on film. we also did not make an audio recording of it, as each light emitted no sound whatsoever.\r\n\r\nwe got about halfway down this road when i turned around and the light - and all other lights - had disappeared. it was an incredible experience, probably the most irrational thing that both of us had

entering the charleston, wv metro area, i observed an object, that appeared to be cigar or cylinder shaped, hovering maybe 500 feet above the city valley area, closer to the west end of the city.\r\n\r\nthe interstate at this point is elevated above the city, which sits closer to river level. so my view of the object appeared to be straight on.\r\n\r\nthere were periods of rain and sunshine in the area during my travels, and several rainbows had appeared. i had attempted to take a few pictures of the rainbows, and while observing the rainbows, i then noticed the object.\r\n\r\nat first, i thought it was a small airplane, as yeager airport is nearby. it was silver-mettallic in appearance, and was reflecting part of the bright sun that had caused the rainbows to appear during the intermittant rain showers. it looked cigar shaped, and appeared to just be hovering, but from living nearby yeager airport, and after having served in the u.S. navy aboard an aircraft carrier for several years, i was/am aware that planes can have the appearance of being stationary, despite actually moving. initially as i rounded a large curve n the interstate, the object was ahead of me, hovering over the valley. it did not appear to be very high in the sky at that point.  as it reflected light from what i would refer to as its fuselage, i stared to think maybe it was a little odd.\r\n\r\nas i moved further down the interstate, eastward bound, i continued to approach closer to the object. it didn't appear to have wings or engines or a propellar, but i stil couldn't rule out an airplane based on previous experience with aircraft sitightings and knowing that depending on the angle in which they are viewed, features of an airplane are not always visible.\r\n\r\ntraffic was fairly heavy at that time, so i had to keep making quick glances at the object, and then turn back to the traffic and road around me.\r\n\r\nthe entire sighting lasted about 1.5 minutes. as i reached a point on the interstate where i was looking at what i would call the very rear of the object, i thought for about 2-3 seconds that maybe it was a miliatary style helicpter with the large dual rotors in the front and back. upon further attempts of examination (keep in mind, i had to keep making quick glances at the object, then back to the road and traffic) it appeared to have a large chevron at the very front tip of the object, and a very large chevron of equal size at the very rear of the object. it appeared to be moving north at this point, away from y location on the interstate. there was no trail of exhaust or anything of that nature, and no detectable sound.\r\n\r\ni glanced for a very split second at the road, and then immediately back to the object, but it was no longer there.\r\n\r\nthis is an open valley area, and from the perspective of the interstate positioning i was in, i could literally see for miles in the direction of north over my left shoulder. there were clouds a couple of miles ahead of the direction the object appeared to be headed in, and several hundred feet above the elevation the object appeared to be situated in, but none in the immediate area for the object to \"fly into.\" it had instantly and completely disappeared from view in the amount it takes to glance from left to forward and then back to the left.\r\n\r\ni do not know if maybe it was a drone, or some other type of small aircraft. it was hard to judge the size of the object, but i would say it was between 10-20 feet, but the lcoation of the chevrons/wings on the object and the way it was just no longer in sight in an area where i should have been able to view it for miles made it seeem odd, almost as if it was observing the rainbows or the rain showers as well.\r\n\r\ni cannot say that i know it was an extra-terrestrial craft, but it just struck me as odd the way it appeared to hover lower to the ground than a normal small craft would, and then the appearance of the object initially looking as if it had no wings/appeandages and later looking as if it had large wings or chevrons in the front and rear, and then its eventual disappearance from sight altogether in an instant. maybe nothing to it at all, just struck me as odd.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

drove home to tell us about the incident.  we looked at the sky and could see nothing there.  it was >3 hrs after sunset but the sky was a grey/black, impacted by the light pollution of major shopping

enclosure.  as i opened the door, i looked up and across the street, above the houses, i saw a small orange ball in the sky.  thinking it was a firework i watched it to see if it would explode, but, it did not.  it came closer and then started moving very slowly toward the north.  a few seconds later another one appeared, looking exactly the same as the first.  it was slightly behind the first one, exactly in line with it.  all i could think is, \"what in the world is this??\"  out of the same spot in the sky came this fireball coming so fast that i stepped back.(you'll think this is really crazy, but, when it stopped up there in front of me all i could think was this thing acted like it knew me.)  i watched as it burned up in the sky, a clean burn, the whole ball in flame.  but, the flames were only coming from the top, not the sides or the bottom, but, the whole ball was on fire.  i took a few more steps toward it and it stayed up there, burning.  the two balls that came before it stood up in the sky and didn't move as if they were waiting for this third ball.  i wanted to run into the house to get the cell phone to take pictures, but didn't because i was afraid they would be gone when i came back out and because my feet felt planted to the cement of the driveway.  two cars came by and all i could do was point up to the sky and say, \"look.\"  no one stopped.  i called twice for the guy next door, but he never came out.  the big fireball started to move very slowly falling in line with the other two balls (still not on fire)and they all moved very slowly toward the north.  i started to walk on the sidewalk, but didn't go far until they were out of sight to me...I just wanted to get back in the house. i looked at the clock and it was 9:05 p.M. \r\n\r\ni have searched all over and have found no pictures or video of what i saw. i called the newspaper and left a message on their voicemail asking if anyone had reported seeing lights in the sky and even if not, could they call me back...I never received a call.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then
