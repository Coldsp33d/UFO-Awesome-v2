starts in daylight so you can see the large area of sky its showing. the top right object in all frames is the edge of the roof of my deck. the trees visible are large maples standing roughly 80+ feet high.  \r\n\r\nthe video starts 10/17/14 in daytime, cycles through night/daytime until 10/22/14. in the first minutes of the video, on the night of 10/17-18/14, there is a small white light caught by the cameras infrared: i believe this to be a spider or bug. im not positive, but thats what it looks like. i capture bugs, leaves blowing, birds/bats/raindrops quite a lot, so i know what they generally look like on \"film\". if you zoom in you can see little appendages which i guess to be spider legs as i've seen them in the pictures captured often.  if you look at the timestamp (top left), later in the video at about 21:00 hours,the next night on 10/18/14 is when the anomalous object appears.  \r\n \r\nwe were away for the weekend, which is peculiar as i captured an orb sighting on this webcam while we were away from home once before (not as long lasting, though much larger and apparently closer), about two years ago (never reported this one from two years ago). i have the webcam setup to record jpg files named sequentially each time motion is detected and storing a single jpg for each capture. unfortunately they are rather low resolution, 640x480. with software i combined the jpg's into a motion picture at 1 frame per second. the webcam timestamps each picture, so you can read the time of each picture giving a sense of realtime movement of this object. what makes this orb recording particularly interesting are a number of facts: \r\n\r\nat the end of the sequence you can see daylight breaking, and can see this object under the clouds.  \r\n\r\ni was staying 3 hours away, but i believe it was mostly cloudy that night. it certainly was when daybreak comes and we can see the object in front of the clouds. we can be assured it was not a celestial object. i have seen the moon captured by this webcam many times.. it is usually much smaller (about 1/2 or less the size of this object), and of course the moon roughly follows the ecliptic - which this object doesn't do as indicated by the many hours of movements captured.\r\n\r\nthe object seems to give off a reflection that seems to light up the clouds or sky below it. there sometimes appear to be two faint objects (below it) that follow the object (or stay roughly the same distance from it) in various parts of the video. these two lights (many times fainter) appear different than the sometimes seen \"reflection\", although its hard to say if this is also reflection.  \r\n\r\ni can provide the individual pictures that comprised the video as well, if requested.

sound and there was no engine droning. there were no wings, but possibly tail wings and a strong sun reflection was shining from the metallic side. it was a very different airplane. \r\ni had never

stars.  i noticed what appeared to be 3 planes, flying oddly close to each other.  two were blinking rapidly in a bluish/green color, and the 3rd. in bright white.  after observing for about a minute i realized that they were all moving together, and formed a triangle pattern.  the blinking of the lights went from one to the next, to the next.  as i was pointing it out to my 9 year old daughter, they vanished.  a moment later they were replaced by two sets of huge orange lights.  each set had 3 lights in it, in a straight line.  they hovered, and then moved independently from each other.  my husband was driving in a vehicle ahead of me, and as my daughter and i were remarking about the lights and trying to figure out what they may be, my husband started backing down the road toward us.  it was apparent that he'd seen them as well and was trying to get a better look.  about that time they descended rapidly toward the tree line, and then disappeared.  my husband began to drive off, and i looked all around for the lights.  they were now directly behind my in my review mirror.  i floored the car in fear and when i looked in the review mirror again they had disappeared.  this is the second time we've seen lights like this in this area.  the first was a few months ago, and about a mile west of this sighting.  the lights that time were also huge and orange, but moved in a \"leapfrog\" type pattern, with no more than two lights visable at a time.  then they sped off faster than any plane could ever go.  directly after that, to the southeast, i saw a blue light shoot up from the ground, or possibly one of our many lakes in the area (there are like 60 of them), and then disappear.  this was back at the end of june or beginning of july, so we've blamed it on odd fireworks this whole time, but i've never seen any sort of fireworks like that, and there are woods where we saw the orange lights, so there shouldn't have been fireworks.

red light of similar size a shape. there was also a white light that looked like a star that was directly underneath a powerline in the distance. i knelt down to see if it was just a star in the sky but the object did not move? then i stepped up on my tippy toes and the object remained where it was, just under the power line? this object seemed to be following me or tricking me? i woke up my friend and he witnessed the same thing i did with awe! he went back to sleep and i was very intrigued and refused to go directly to sleep until i've explained this somehow? i layed in bed and looked out my window. eventually i started to see these white lights that changed to a dull red, they looked like stars moving around in the sky. i pulled out my phone and started to record what i was seeing. these lights began to morph into many similar lights and explode outwards, only to come back together morphing back into one solid light? these light showed extreme intelligence in the patterns they were moving in. what i witnessed that night i will never forget. i have 47 minutes of video footage from my phone of this event. i have seen the video several times and if you have good vision you can see these these lights and some of there movements. i hope that i can have this video analysed professionally and that we can use some professional program to really see these objects as i was seeing them with my own eyes. they were very far away, but if we can zoom in and find a way to brighten these object, i'm convinced that this will be the most compelling video footage of

look at the thing.\r\n we slowed down to a crawl and i got as close to the thing as i could and we watched it float over the road in front of my car about 20 feet from bing under it. \r\n as it passed over the road my car was right beside it as it floated over the dirt median.  i was looking up at it at a 45 degree angle. it was about 10 feet off the ground and about 15 to 20 feet tall. and the with as 2.5 to 3 feet wide at it's widest part.  it was tapered at both ends. it was like a black hole. non-reflective.\r\n     we watched it float to the other side of the road and lower itself to about 3 feet off the ground and turn on a light that looked like a 4 inch round circle of glass attached to 3 metal i-beams that came to a point. no wires. no sound and no dust in the light that came from the thing. the light on the ground was pure white light with a razor sharp edge to it. the 4 inch disk started to scan around the desert floor as if was looking for something. it moved around the plants and it was the most graceful thing i have ever seen. mike and i watched it go off into the desert until it was out of sight.    \r\n the files are illustrations i made of what i saw.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

(the star wasn't very high like the other star, but it was high enough in the sky to not be some man made 'light bulb'.) so i stared at it for a couple of seconds and suddenly it blinked and there was darkness over there. so i asked my friend to look and after a couple of seconds it came back. this time both of us were staring at it and it stayed 'on' for like 5-6 seconds and this time it went 'off' in a very dramatic way. i can't explain the feeling but this time it went off in a way which said it won't come back on again. and that's what exactly happened. we stayed over there for 10-15 mins looking towards it. it didn't come back. \r\nalso i'm not sure but the star was there all the while before it blinked, cause i might have looked towards it but not paying a lot of attention to it.\r\n\r\nalso i'm not saying that was a ufo or something. it was something strange so i decided to report it. also there were no clouds over there which could have obstructed it's view. it couldn't be a tower or man made light cause it was too high. it couldn't be an airplane cause the light wasn't moving. it was stationary for too long to be an airplane or sattelite.
