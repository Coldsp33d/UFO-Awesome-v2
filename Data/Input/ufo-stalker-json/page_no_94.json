the surrounding mountains. this is the second time we have both seen strange orbs in the night sky in the evening from our back deck. in both cases, there were two light orbs (larger and brighter than the light from stars) that hovered just above the mountain range horizon. they would bob and hover, moving both left and right and up and down, but mostly up and down, as though \"bouncing\". the movement was too extreme to be helicopters, and far too fast. after about 10 minutes of watching them hover over the forest, they would ascend upwards very quickly and then the light would disappear. the second time we saw this (a few days ago), there were multiple aircraft in the air all around them. the aircraft did not go near the orbs, but created a circle around them. there is an airport in johnson city and asheville. on this night, we saw one airplane taking a north-south flight path, but there were several other craft in the sky with blinking lights that appeared stationary, and were at a higher elevation in the sky, on all sides around the orbs. the orbs were too far away to get any good photos, or to see shape, but they did appear slightly elongated, or oval instead of round. the orbs bobbed and hovered for about 10 minutes, then slowly bobbed along the mountain horizon, following the slope of the tallest mountain range. one of them disappeared below the mountain range, and the other stayed in the sky and hovered at the peak of the range before we went inside. the section of forest behind us has very few homes, if any, since most of it is national forest, so we have little light pollution. we estimate that these orbs were approximately 2 miles away because the ridge that one of the orbs disappeared behind is about 1 3/4 miles away as the crow flies.

object is about half a foot in diameter and perfect in form, the object appeared suddenly within a 30 to 1 hour drive as my mother came home from work (story told by her) and through a small dust storm. \r\n\r\nclearly seen from the photo is that the object took form within the dust on the windshield. my mother was very astonished when she arrived home to suddenly for the first time see this mandala on her car driver-side windshield. i investigated for a long time and tried to run down every possible logical explanation. it does not make sense that someone (human) made this, the perfection of the mandala is outmatched. furthermore, there was no instance in which someone could have done this because the object took form within the time of her driving her commute home. the dust appears to gather in an oddly specific location as well. my mother, sister, and i all took pictures and left this situation as confused as the situation first appeared. \r\n\r\nmy suspicion of this event links with former and subsequent subliminal communications with vastly evolved extraterrestrial beings, some within the waking state but mostly through semi-lucid dream states.\r\n\r\ni hope you

conditions were the same as the last sighting. the air had a feeling to it that was familiar and i was compelled to drive to the location. i had a feeling i was going to see something. i parked the car so i could look at the area of sky i saw the last one in. i rolled down the side window and got my binoculars and iphone camera ready.  i was there about twenty minutes watching passenger jet traffic. i looked down at my iphone and when i looked at the sky again the craft appeared descending in a turning maneuver. it then started to ascend still turning. i took my eyes off it for less than a second to take a picture and when i looked again it was gone. very frustrating! i decided i would take some pictures of the sky anyway to see if  the camera could see what  i could not. and in one of the pictures an object was there but much further away and no longer had the brilliance it once had. i noticed the object because i was looking for it and it was bright silver and reflecting light from the low sun on the horizon. i have seen jets reflect the sun in the same way at times but the shape, maneuvering, and flight characteristics was nothing like a jet. it did not seem to be relying on the atmosphere for flight. i can’t describe it entirely but it had a kind of floating flight. the object looked like an oval disc with a strange ball or egg sitting on top something like a tea cup on a saucer. they seemed to be two separate parts. like one was getting a ride from the other. it was extremely bright silver and was reflecting light from the sun. at the distance i saw it at i would estimate it to at least be the size of a\r\nboeing 747. the strangest thing is i knew i would see it. i could feel it in the air. the air felt the same as when i saw one about a year earlier in the same location. we had just had rain and the storm was over. the sky was clearing with very few clouds left. i even had the car positioned so well the object appeared in the center of the piece of sky i was watching through the drivers side window. even though i had the camera in my lap it was something so out of the ordinary it was almost hypnotizing. i had to force myself to try to take a picture. file #1 original picture, file#2 enlargement, file #3 three things in a row, clouds? file#4 enlargement, file #5 color enhanced enlargement. i will also send drawings with compass headings,

unable so i called my wife outside. she saw what i saw and was equally amazed. a family out on an evening walk also witnessed it as did my landlord and his partner. also a car pulled up and asked us if we were looking at the lights. they disappeared and we went back into the house. i had a feeling that wasn’t it so i went right back outside and within a minute the started to reappear this time we witnessed a total of seven of them in strange patterns. appearing and disappearing. eventually they all disappeared and we also notice there was absolutely no air traffic over phoenix. helicopters made a beeline out of the area. it was if the whole area was cleared of all air traffic for about 20 minutes which typically this time of evening and also being thanksgiving there is usually lots of air traffic. i’m am certain this was witnessed by many people in phoenix and yet nothing on the news.","distance":"Over One

the backyard of our caravan area. he was excited making lots of bubbles that were going everywhere. it was a perfect clear afternoon, not a cloud in the sky and perfect weather. as my nephew was making his soap bubbles, at one stage he pointed to the sky and said something like \"oh wow, look!\", then continued on making more. at first i thought he was referring to the bubbles. as i looked up something caught my eye. i noticed two very bright lights in the sky sort of hovering on about a 60 degree angle above us. they were moving very slowly towards us. it was coming from a n/e direction at about the height of a low small cesna. at first i thought it was a plane, but as i tried to focus on the \"object\" i noticed that there was actually nothing in between the two lights. it appeared like something may have been there but i could see right through it? maybe cloaked? i got the impression that these \"lights\" were observing us, and that i was not supposed to see them. i felt that i caught them \"off-guard\". the lights were extremely bright, especially since it was daytime. at this stage i knew something was unusual about them so i called out to my brother who was inside. i never took my eyes off them. at this moment the two lights (in unison) moved across the sky in an instant, then again twice more before the lights faded out, like powerful spotlights powering down. from where i was standing, the maneuver was left (at arms length about 60 cm) then a 45 degree angle right (about 30cm) then straight down (about 30 cm). this maneuver was lightning quick with the lights stopping after each move for a split second before moving again, this was seemingly not possible for anything i previously thought had existed. by the time the lights faded out and disappeared my brother came out. i was lost for words, with an overwhelming feeling of excitement and in disbelief. it took a few moments for me to gather my words. after explaining to my brother what i had just witnessed, we went back outside to have another look. the only thing that we noticed was a tiny black aircraft at a very high altitude flying in the opposite direction. i do not know if this was related or not. that was the only thing that he saw. it was a very profound experience.

de la tierra durante generaciones, desde ese año hasta nuestros días.\r\ndurante los pasados meses y junto con otros vecinos superficiarios de la provincia de santa cruz y la región de magallanes en el sur de la patagonia de argentina y chile, nos venimos reuniendo con científicos y profesionales que radicados aquí en el extremo austral investigan estos misterios con un alto perfil tecnológico y una seria y responsable confidencialidad que nos ha asegurado que nuestros testimonios permanezcan reservados.\r\neste equipo de personas sabias nos viene motivando para que expongamos nuestras experiencias públicamente a través de medios serios de carácter internacional como mufon, ello hacemos.\r\nnuestro abuelo tiene 98 años, el llegó a la patagonia a los 5 años en 1924 cuando parte de nuestra familia venía escapando de las crisis económicas del hemisferio norte.\r\naquí lo esperaban nuestros parientes ya radicados hacía mas de 2 décadas, y \"yoco\", un perro mestizo patagónico ya adulto que lo eligió como compañero de vida y en quién nuestro abuelo encontró un amigo inseparable  de aventuras en una tierra que por aquellas épocas era lejana, dura y aislada y que en era denominada \"el desierto patagónico\" con todo lo que ello implica.\r\nen 1929 nuestro abuelo tenía 9 años y con toda la familia se trasladaban desde río gallegos hacia uno de los campos al norte por lo que hoy es la ruta nacional 40 en ese entonces sin la actual denominación ya que además la provincia era en ese tiempo territorio nacional de santa cruz.\r\nlas rutas en esa época eran apenas huellas consolidadas y no había puentes para cruzar el caudaloso río santa cruz, los viajes duraban días y muchas veces se dormía en pesadas tiendas de campaña a la vera del camino o si había suerte en algún catre de alguno de los pocos paradores denominados \"boliches\" instalados cada tanto en los caminos, para seguir con las primeras luces del nuevo día.\r\nel río santa cruz se cruzaba con balsas de madera, unidas a una y otra orilla con pesadas cuerdas y con las cuales se cruzaban personas, mercancías y vehículos.\r\nuna de esas balsas era de que operaba en el paso charles furh tal como figura hoy en los matas, antes se denominaba charles furth cual es el verdadero nombre del \"bolichero\", el dueño que tenía en el lugar la propiedad de la balsa, un almacén de ramos generales, pequeño hotel y otros negocios asociados.\r\nel abuelo y la familia cruzó el río hacia el norte cerca de las 9 de la mañana al verificar que no había lugar en el hotel, para luego prepararse a pasar la noche a unos 700 metros donde el río da una vuelta y hay reparo del fuerte viento patagónico detrás de una pequeña meseta de unos 60 metros de altura que rodean las aguas.\r\ncerca del mediodía ya estaba todo listo para el almuerzo y la familia se empezó a reunir entorno al fogón, mi abuelo había estado con \"yoco\" jugando en unos matorrales en la base de la pequeña meseta y escribe mi bisabuelo en su diario de viaje que lo llamó.\r\nmi abuelo vino corriendo hacia el fogón hecho a la orilla del río desde unos 40 metros, y \"yoco\" atrás, cuando un objeto muy brillante se levantó de lo alto de la meseta y bajó en dirección a ellos pasando por arriba a muy baja altura.\r\ncuando mi abuelo lo vio ya pasaba sobre él y se dirigía hacia el norte cobrando altura para luego desaparecer entre la pocas nueves del día soleado.\r\npero \"yoco\" ya no estaba, esa cosa se lo había llevado, nunca lo volvieron a ver.\r\nel objeto era brillante, grande, sus luces cambiaban de color y hay anotaciones que hablan de un sonido no identificado.\r\nmi abuelo fue golpeado por ese evento hasta lo mas profundo de su alma, mi familia tuvo que permanecer allí por dos días buscando a \"yoco\" hasta que hubieron de convencer a mi abuelo que no lo volvería a ver.\r\nen estos 88 años mi abuelo nunca dejó de rendirle homenaje a su amigo en el mismo lugar el mismo día que esto ocurrió, todos estos años ha ido al mismo lugar y esperado con ojos de niño volver a ver a su \"yoco\".\r\nninguna inteligencia sensible puede dejar de comprender la relación de un perro y un niño, en nuestra familia pensamos que estos misterios pertenecen a una inteligencia insensible que permanece oculta porque no puede comprender, o no quiere hacerlo, la naturaleza humana; o tal vez porque de hecho en solo una inteligencia malvada y oculta en las sombras nos acecha.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then
