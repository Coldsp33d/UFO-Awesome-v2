flying in front of the moon. the moon was now at least 30 degrees in the sky. i had the moon zoomed in, i;m not sure how many times. (i think it was 45 times, with nearly full moon filling up most of the view through the eyepiece. although i couldn't tell the object's exact elevation, i had a \"sense\", or i perceived the object to be at an elevation considerably higher than that of civil aircraft. the object looked to move at about the same speed as a jet would look like through the telescope. with this in mind, i theorized that the object would need to be moving at a speed of at least about 600 mph, perhaps at thousands of miles per hour. as i tracked the object with my telescope, i watched the object pass in front of the side of the moon that was not sunlit. i could still see the object because it was darker than the surrounding sky. (although the sky was cloudless, it still glowed due to light from the moon or lights, etc.) it's shape was bizarre, unlike any craft that i know of. it's edges looked straight. it didn't look symmetric. it looked like a jumbled up pile of random shapes randomly thrown on each other in no particular order. i think it may have had curved edges on it as well, but i'm not sure. the shape didn't change, spin, rotate, etc. i observed the object until it passed in front of the \"edge\" of the moon. as it seemed to pass in front of the \"edge\" of the moon, i tried keeping track of it but i lost it for approximately half a second. it seemed to change color so quickly that i wasn't able to notice, making itself the same color as the sky. in other words, it seemed to \"disappear\". i didn't see it change color but i concluded that something like this happened because i couldn't see it anymore. i think there was a pause of less than a second after it \"disappeared\", but i couldn't quite tell because all of this was happening quickly for me. although the object was invisible, i kept track, as though the object was till moving on its flight path, to see if the object might reappear. then i observed something in place of the object! sparks appearing, glimmering, and disappearing! it was incredible how far away looked! it was like watching a massive explosion from tens of miles away!\r\ni didn't get my camera because i was afraid i wasn't going to get back on time to record the object, but that would have been an incredible view if i were to record it! after the object was gone, i kept observing the moon. five minutes later, i observe the same event! this time i observed the object more closely. sure enough, it looked like an object in orbit. this object flew in front of the \"edge\" of the moon, and did the same thing. i may have increase the magnification of the telescope at this time, but anyways i was able to have a more detailed look. as i looked closer at the object, i noticed it's dull, nonreflective, and solid. as i looked more carefully at what exactly was happening to the object as it \"disappeared\", i noticed the sparks were actually burning debris being ejected from the object, and flying in patterns, in what i would call \"streams\". it was similar to how certain kinds of fireworks shells look like when they explode, or when a rocket or space vehicle disintegrates. i did not see any projectiles coming towards any of the objects to blow them down. the color of the sparks was mostly bright white, and i think there were some sparks with hues of yellow/orange/red in them. i don't remember any more details at the moment, but if i do, i will send them in. overall, i don't remeber much about the sighting because i was in such suspense. i would describe it as a mysterious experience and after the sighting i was still mesmerized about how i felt during the sighting.  in other words, i was part of something mysterious that was happening, and i'm experiencing it myself, and i wondered, was there anyone else who observed the same thing? i am now inspired to keep observing the night sky because i know there are mysterious things to be seen that happen in the night sky, you just have to keep observing. i wish i could dedicate the rest of my life to observing the night sky every night and i hope to see more of these

light out in the field or sage brush. though to myself the light must be further than i had judged because i did not get to it and pass it quickly. then i asked my daughter, is it just me or is that light moving. she said yes it looks like it is. i sped up to about 70 mph and slowly gained on the light. it was about 60 yards off the highway, maybe 5' in the air. i thought maybe it was a four wheeler with a blinking light, but then decided a four wheeler could not go 65 mph. about that time we passed an old house and barn yard just off the highway and the light passed through the yard. i knew there was not a road through the yard. we started to discuss what the light could be and it slowly feel behind me. my daughter wanted me to turn around and shine my lights on it, so instead, i just stopped and turned my truck pointing out into the sage brush so we could see what it was when it passed by. it stopped about 100 yards back. i being impatient and wanting to get to our destination said let's go. it started to move when i started to move, but we left it behind. my daughter kept trying to get me to turn around, but i didn't and now i wish i would have. no idea what it was. when we came back through the area during the day on the 18th, the light would have traveled through fields and sage brush with fences so it couldn't have been on a wheeled vehicle, and the distance we could see it was probably about 2 miles long, so i don't think it could have been a remote control unit unless it was quite sophisticated. anyway, kind of fun, but i can't explain

experience. well i was on my way to work normal day a bit cloudy i took the exit 98 of parkway south and right after i paid the toll i noticed something in the sky weird shape dark gray color look like something out of a movie i called my wife and tell her about i was trying to stop but is no shoulder and once i took the  ramp i lost sight of the thing i got very nervous and confused thinking over and over if wherever i just saw was real and finally today i saw your show reverse engineering and saw the pictures of the thing in california that the guy named isaac claims to know about it i didn't see any symbols but was dark gray no noise no lights was just there like it was looking at something.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

believes me anymore.  i've kept these sightings to myself since spring of this year when they began, because no matter what i say, people think i'm hallucinating it.  this is not my imagination and i surely cannot be the only person to keep seeing these.  each sighting is similar, but different.  it always occurs between about 10:00 pm to midnight.  i look up every night with every cigarette break and i have nothing to gain here by telling this, other than some comfort that someone else must be seeing these, i am not crazy, and, i know exactly what these are.  at first, it really seems like a stationary, bright star, that suddenly moves.  i tell myself, it's a satellite or a shooting star, and watch it intently, only for it to defy all logic as the star, moves at speeds that seem impossible.  it moves slow at times, then very very fast.  they often slow down and speed up and stop.  they often switch directions sharply and too quickly to be human.  i have also noticed a second one not far from the first on at least 3 occasions.  the fireflies as i call them now, seem to sometimes do a light dance with each other...I cannot explain it.  they blink at times, resembling morse code.  sometimes, they disappear into thin air and reappear a few seconds later.  i followed one that stopped, dimmed, and sort of resumed looking like just a star, only to go brighter than anything i have ever seen, the brightest of the brightest stars, then fling itself further into the northern horizon.  when i see them, and watch, it's almost like they are trying to look like stars, and trying to hide their movements if that makes any sense.  when i first witnessed these, i thought i was going to have a heart attack.  i have never felt that type of fear except for a dream.  my jaw opened and i couldn't close it.  i couldn't move.  i couldn't breathe. i couldn't focus and i just cried.  that was earlier this summer and i have seen them multiple times since and while i am awe struck every single time, the truth is, nobody can tell me i'm not seeing what i know i am seeing and i don't care if people think i'm crazy because if people just watch long enough, they will see it too.  and, given that these things are being seen so often, i know i will continue to see them, and i will point them out to others when i can, but surely, somebody, can study the skies here and see them and document them.  they are real, they are amazing, and whether you decide to investigate or not, i know, without any doubt, these are not from earth.  once others actually see them, the sheer movements they make will say to anyone, that isn't possible.  whatever that is, it defies physics, and is not a human creation.  i feel a bit scared to be honest.  why are they there?  why hasn't the government been truthful and why are these and other sightings increasing? what is going to happen to us???  i have such an overwhelming sense of fear.  and, anyone that sees these, i know they will too.  you cannot see these things and how they move without getting scared.  surely someone else is seeing them!  that's all i have to say.  i debated doing this all summer until i realized, i have a duty to tell somebody. even if i am not believed, i want my report in the books, because it is real, and i'll go to my grave adamant and completely and utterly convinced that i know what i'm witnessing.  there are no more doubts here.  thank you.  please, have someone watch.  i've no doubts you'll see them.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
