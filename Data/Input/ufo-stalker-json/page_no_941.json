night was very clear, so clear we could see the milky way and the small satellites that circle the earth. we turned off all of the lights in the cabin and stood out in a field to take long exposure photographs of the sky. we rarely get to do this kind of activity, because we live in the city. at some point, as my friend was leaning down to setup another shot and  i was staring up at the night sky amazed by the amount of stars that could be seen with the naked eye, the ufo appeared above us. it was shaped like a boomerang and twirled quickly, silently across the sky. it was huge. from my perspective, i would say it appeared to be about 5 feet wide, but i sensed it was very high in the sky and could only imagine the true size to be much, much larger. and the shape was very sharp, i knew immediately it was made by an intelligent being. it glowed green, like the color of a glow stick, and it seemed that there were markings on the boomerang: a circle near the terminus of each \"wing\" and three thin lines on each side where the \"wings\" met at the center. the craft appeared, spun across the sky from east to west, and then disappeared in a second/second and 1/2; however, i saw so much detail because i was already staring at the sky when the craft appeared. my friend also saw the craft, but only the brightness of it, since she was looking up through her camera. her glimpse was of the ufo's brightness and the last instant of it's appearance.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

howling in the woods in the front of the house. the neighbors dogs were raising sane. i went in the house and walked out the front door and let my dog out in a fenced in area. i was standing on the front porch looking toward the woods, when i first noticed it in the sky, i thought it was a jet contrail (a little short one). but as i kept looking at it i noticed it had two glowing orbs on each end of it, also it was not moving like a jet contrail would following a jet. the sun was to the right of it, from the position i was standing i was having to look into the sun. there was not a cloud in the sky other than that. i had my cellphone in my pocket, i  walked out on the sidewalk to where a tree was blocking the sun and started taking pictures. while i  was doing that it seemed to be floating are drifting closer to me. as it got closer i noticed it was taking the shape of a circle with the two orbs directly across from each other one was at 12:00 and the other at the 6:00 position. then the orb at the 12:00 position moved around the circle to the 6:00 position. at that point i noticed that the whole circle was starting to rotate clockwise. it seemed as if a small cloud(for lack of a better word)started to form and rotate to about the 9:00 position, the orb that was at 6:00 moved around the circle and disappeared into the cloud. then another orb appeared in front of the circle it went into the circle between the 7:00@8:00 position and disappeared in the same small cloud, the orb that had moved first from 12:00 to 6:00 also disappeared. at that point the circle itself seemed to go through the small cloud that had formed and then started dissipating. i took 20 pictures of it in about 3 min. i don't know how long it had been there before i saw it. the picture number081549 has the orb in front of the circle, my camera was zoomed out if you zoom in and look in front of the circle about halfway to the tree you should see it. the next picture 081600 shows the orb entering the circle between 7:00@8:00.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

shooting stars. we continued to watch as it entered the atmosphere then stopped directly ahead of us just above the horizon. i can still point out the exact spot. after it stopped, with a somewhat bright light, it blasted an even greater bright light then took off. we were able to watch the object zig zag (3-4 switchbacks) into space for about 10-15 seconds. what made us think its was unearthly was 1) distance 2)speed 3)directional change and 4)light. there was no specific shape except for the light orb it produced. sky was perfectly clear. i was surprised by the object because for 1 i have

sky. the cluod cover was broken. probably alto cumulus. i observed 4 lights rotating in a counter clockwise direction, viewed from the ground. the lights would expand outward to a maximum diameter and then shrink back to a single focal point and repeat. the period of rotation was ~ 2 seconds . the period of max diameter to focal point was ~ 10 seconds.  the light was only visible because it was hitting the clouds. the length of the light beam was longest at the max diameter  and of course smallest at the focal point -- probably 5 times as long  compared to its length at the focal point. there is an uncontrolled airport --doylestown airport  - in that direction-  but i do not know of any distress or navigation aid that makes that pattern.  i could not convince myself if the light was from above the clouds or below the clouds.  if below the the clouds you might expect to see the a beam shaft --- there was none. i called my friends out to observe ..They were amazed -  stumped as well. my friends wife asked if we were in danger.\r\ni have an iphone 4 and took snap shots and video --- nothing shows up however -\r\nmaybe you have enhanced capability.\r\n\r\nthe lights eventually stopped after ~ 15 minutes.  the center of rotation seemed to drift to the left(south)as time progressed   -but only slightly\r\n\r\ni can send you my digital files later if you'd

abductions was not in there vocabulary . the next day or the first day of my change, all my hair fell out in my bed , the feeling of being bald at 19 was ruff, i took my shirt off for some reason and looked in the mirror and a spot around 1/2 the size of a penny with the pigment gone, perfect circle, with a small red dot in the middle was on my spine about hafe way down my back. i still think about it almost daily , wife is cathoilic, so is mom ,so is my son so there is no one that believes, even when i do things like the last day i saw my dad 6 years ago, i cry and told wife and son lets leave, told dad bye and i love him which was never said my whole life, wife ask whats  the tears for, i reply ill never see my dad again, he will die in a few days, 3days later he died. the effects from this only allows me to see things, bad things that only effect me , in my 30 years after, i seemed to have cheated death 6x, car wrecks mostly with 2x being guns. i cant say for sure what happen

moon when i saw a airplane flying high near the moon,suddenly i noticed a bright white starlike light i thought it was a star but it was actually moving i thought it was another airplane but it was at very great height and it was a airplane it would have been leaving trails of smoke behind it and there were also no blinking lights around it like in a airplane,it wasn't also a breaking star because it didn't have any tail behind it,the object was flying faster thsn any airplane,it appeared in the east side of the moon and travelled in a straight line towards the west side and as soon as i took out my cellphone to record it disappeared,i was sure it was a ufo because nithing can travel at such height without leaving and trails of exhaust gases behind it and also few days ago this event i saw some abnormal lighting in mira road west which is totally e.Pty area for salt pans and forest which never appeared there before,i felt that i since i have been watching many shows which reveal about the aliens and thier activities,which are probably against humans i thought is there something like that going on in mira road west? are they planning a attack against humans?Whole day i kept on thinking about that object and tried to relate it to that unidentied light in mira road west,i thought to record it as no one believed in what i said about the lights in mira road west but as soon as i took out my cellphone it just vanished away i tried to search it everywhere around the moon and from that day i always keep an eye on the moon for more proofs of ufos","distance":"Over One
