county road 1, i had thought the blinking light was a radio tower, until i seen it slowly rising., and noticed there was no pole beneath it. i pulled off to the side of county road 1 exit, and began filming the object with my iphone 4, at first, the light was blinking through the clouds. about a minute and a half later, it had risen above the clouds and was slowly moving in the north direction, over me. \r\n\r\nat this point, i was able to see the object in person. it was a perfect black saucer shaped object, with a bit of a triangular pointy tip in the front. by then, i was in shock. i felt like my brain was telling me no, yet my eyes were telling me yes. the scariest and most unbelievable part for me, was the lights. the lights were blinking in a circular motion, one after the other, making a full rotation around the saucer, exactly like the ones you would see in a movie, or cartoon. i was feeling anxiety by now, honestly wondering if it noticed me. \r\n\r\nthe whole movement of the saucer was simple. all it did was hover in the sky from about 40 ft from the ground, until it was above the clouds. it hovered in a straight line. its hard to describe how far away it was from me, maybe about a football field away. i was able to see the chiseling detail of the ship, and the lights were picture-perfect clear. there was no blur. after about 2 minutes it was slowly gliding/flying/hovering over my car, close enough so i could see the bottom of the ship. i then turned off my camera, and drove home. \r\n\r\ni fully regret leaving so early, as i wanted to see what it did next. oh well, my mind was racing, i was in shock, and in dis-belief. what i saw was not an airplane, nor a helicopter, nor anything average. i was watching this object sit in the sky for over a minute. it was a saucer shaped ship, with a point. the lights were perfectly clear in person, and the moved around the ship similar to a casino light, or lights you would see in las vegas for example. \r\n\r\nunfortunately my iphone 4 could not zoom in while recording, and i wish i had taken some zoomed in pictures of it, and it was a poor quality video. it was a beautiful thing to see,

brightness and then faded out. i observed this uninterrupted under a clear sky. i am 100% certain of what i saw. the only conclusion that i could draw was that i had seen a craft that was travelling,

time and at one point a fifth light came out.  this went on for 45 minutes, the lights eventually started to move north.  the last i saw was the lights coming together in one light orb and then disappeared.  throughout this event i noticed several planes moving through the area.  the orbs were much lower in the sky than the air planes.

jesup, ga and my house was flown over by airplanes from ft stewart army base (cause i was dating a pilot from there) and jets from the moody air force base in valdosta ga. upon seeing these objects first i thought they were jets but they had no sound and didn't move like jets. after looking at them longer they seemed to be round in shape and the formation was 2 in front and 2 in back, but erratic. the front 2 stopped in mid air and the back 2 zoomed in front of them. suddenly now one of the front ones made a loop back around to the other 2 behind them. then they all seemed to be playing catch me if you can, then scattered at a fast rate of speed. now i know this is impossible. i got scared and ran down to my aunt’s house to tell her but she laughed at me. i was 17 years old

descended, and then began to behave erratically in the sky.  \r\n\r\nthere were two occurrences (1 of 2 filmed) tied to this event.  the first (unfilmed but observed) occurred approximately 7pm est and was initially only one (1) light that was observed from an outside parking lot.  the light suddenly appeared in the sky, and then descended before its view was obstructed by a building that was a few feet from us.\r\n\r\nthe second occurrence happened several minutes later where multiple lights appeared.  this occurrence was both observed and filmed by us.\r\n\r\neast of where we were standing, 3 lights appeared in the sky (approximately 1/4 mile from where we were.)  immediately after the three lights appeared, we quickly observed tails (almost like flames) behind them.  the first thought was that it was a broken up fireball, until it was noticed all 3 had initially appeared, ascended, and then descended relatively in the same direction.  it was then suggested that it was fireworks, but there was no noise associated with it.  in addition, the objects looked more like flames were coming from then than “sparks.”  \r\n\r\nthe objects began to zig-zag erratically, ascending and descending.  on occasion a dark object could almost be seen above the glowing objects.  the next thought was that it may have been parachutists night jumping with flares, but the objects looked too large, including the trail of flames/sparks.  in addition, there are no landing fields anywhere east of our position where we were filming, and anything landing would have landed in the city. no planes were observed in the immediate area during this time frame; and parachutists have never been observed jumping and/or descending in this manner. it should also be pointed out that it was a calm evening with little to no wind. \r\n\r\napproximately 1-2 minutes later of observing the zig-zagging of the lights, the tails began to diminish, and a fourth light appeared east of the 3 lights.  the three lights began to quickly slow down, and descend after the appearance of the 4th light.  at one point, at least one light began to pulse a few times, before diminishing all together.  after approximately another minute, all 3 lights diminished, and only the 4th light remained, where we observed it descend, ascend, zig-zag, turn, and then hover for a lengthy period of time before disappearing altogether.\r\n\r\nwe remained in the area for an additional 1/2 hour and never saw the lights reappear.\r\nnote: video/audio was taken with cellphone.  orientation is off.  my
