(military, private, commercial, tourist, blimp, fireworks, search lights, etc.) this was not like any of them! \r\n\r\ni recall noticing these two red orbs very prominent in my peripheral view in the north-east direction of the sky... but initially discounting them as regular air traffic (as we have so much) and i was focused on my boy. also during this time and sporadically, we saw many other craft such as airplanes & helicopters. the sky was mostly clear with a tiny bit of light haze in some parts of the higher horizon... however, they were not in the haze part of the sky. we could verify this against the look of the identified crafts we saw traveling through and all around during and after the events. \r\n\r\nthe two red orbs were staggered and one appeared slightly brighter than the other. they did not appear to 'fly in' towards us... they were 'just there'... may have traveled slowly toward us a bit, traveled east a bit? turning?... then slowly faded away... the whole time pulsating, (not blinking) there was no pattern and no sets of running/safety lights as other craft have. \r\n\r\nthere were no clouds for them to \"disappear from our view\"... they literally vanished and reappeared a short time again, doing this three times!\r\n\r\nas my son and i are witnessing this we were yelling for dad to \"come quick and bring a camera!\" we were all so very excited and grateful to witness this event. we continued expressing our excitement/gratitude and tried 'calling' them back... thus we kept watching in hopes they would reappear... and they did! two more times! =) ...And did the same things. we felt only positive feelings and excitement.\r\n\r\ni tried to capture it on video but it proved challenging... (so sorry about that but at least its something)... and i was very much enamored with what i was watching... the tiny bit of video is nothing compared to what we physically saw in person and this lasted for at least a good 20 minutes off and on. (9:15pm/pdt to about 9:25pm/pdt)\r\n\r\ninitially i was still standing on the trampoline...But then hopped off to try to steady it. as i would zoom in, the camera would lose focus but in person they were very prominent yet translucent as well. at times when i zoomed in on the object it seems to disappear though the camera view but viewing it physically with our eyes, it was still there... then slowly faded out.\r\n\r\ni used my (fairly current model) sony digital hd camera... in comparison it seems our cell phones have taken better footage than this. not sure what my settings are on but i will check that out and fix for the next potential event. looks like its only hd for stills.?\r\n\r\ni know what i saw... and...I know what it wasn't... this was a ufo event! i wish you all could see the entire event as we did. i will do my best to get some better footage the next time as we are definitely not alone here.\r\n\r\neyes open - look up & share people! try to capture footage the best you can and share share share <3 <3 <3 onward & upward <3 <3 <3","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":60682,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.8433632,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10172014-0022","longitude":-117.9111236,"occurred":1413519000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1413593412000,"summary":"Two staggered, very prominent red pulsating orbs: did not seem to 'fly in from a distance', they just appeared, hovered, may have traveled a bit turned on a short path before disappearing. this repeated 3 times in a half hours time.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files/60682_submitter_file1__MOV04264.MPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/60682_submitter_file2__MOV04265.MPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Anaheim, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:92151"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Panvel","country":"India","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"1) i was driving my bike during night .\r\n2)as it was night time so this ufo just catched my sight .\r\n3)i thought it was a plane .\r\n4) this object was hovering above the building and  when i looked at it , i just stopped my bike and it was not moving it was just hovering and after few minutes it just diminished slowly .\r\n5) i always have believed in ufos but never watched but this was my first experience .\r\n6)as i started my bike and i was maintaining eye contact with that object and after few minutes it slowly diminished .

then i tried to describe what was happening to my girlfriend and couldn't express it. then i realized that the first light that i saw was actually following the object. it look to me like an arch looking cloud was being pushed really fast by an invisible object and the cloud was not dissipating or disappearing. it was just going extremely fast. the light that i saw was at least 1/4 to 1/2 a

dissipated in the sky. both of them. i was clueless on what it was. i was like, wait and tried to make sense out of it, and briefly went back to explain it to my girlfriend, but i couldn't really put it into words over the phone, so i told her i would tell her today.\r\n\r\nit was about 11 pm, in holiday fl 34690","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

looking up i saw a disk shaped glowing yellowish/orange with a dark circle in the middle.  i was in awe as i saw it hovering which didn't seem more than 1000 ft above!  i was so much in awe i didn't even point it out to my friend.  when i first saw it i though maybe it was ball lightning.  but after it took off at a incredible speed seeming to elevate i knew it wasn't ball lightning!  i did extensive research on ball lightning after my sighting to be sure.  after researching it i am positive it was not ball lightning!  as far as the objects movements, it hovered for about ten seconds and took off in the blink of and eye!  i did not blink though!  it made no noise and upon its ne take-off all i saw was a yellow streak.  that is when i lost site of the object.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was taking photos of the sunrise early in the morning. the location was on the 20th floor of an apartment building looking roughly ne approx. 15mi. towards the toronto downtown skyline.\r\n\r\nafter taking several photos i noticed that 1 of them had an unusual silvery disk beside the cn tower in toronto. this is an area in downtown toronto near to the island (billy bishop) airport. small planes would fly by on a regular basis. after checking my photos taken of the skyline, this is the only image with the suspicious object.\r\n\r\nhowever, given the shutter speed of 1/4s that was used, a plane flying would be recorded as a short line across the sky. the object that was captured appeared to be stationary. was it a plane? an airship?   i've never seen a weather balloon in this area so i don't think it was a balloon.\r\n\r\nthe first image was the original that came out of my digital camera with no computer touchup or enhancement. the second is a copy of the first with an arrow added to show where the suspicious object was. since the object was only seen for such as short duration, there is a possibility the object may be a helicopter that remained stationary for a short time and then took off. at this point i don't want to jump into 1 conclusion until i get other opinions.","distance":"Over One

cream, and i went to the sink with the ice cream for no reason, i never did that before, and i looked out the window into my backyard. it was around 8:00pm and it was quite dark. there were no clouds in the sky. being an astronomy fanatic i love looking at the stars and pointing out constallations, bur what i saw that night wasn't normal. at first i saw a blue-white light the size of a star, but then it got brighter and started moving eratically. up down back forward diagonal. it got brighter until it came to be so close to my house that i could see the shape of the ufo quite clearly. it was dark grey and black,and had 3 lights. it was triangular in shape and the lights were on each point. after swooping close to my house it turned back to the sky and became bright as a star again, and still moving frantically until it moved farther and farther away and i couldn't see it anymore. i stood there in awe not believing what i had just witnessed. as soon as i snapped back to reality i called one of my friends and told her the story.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Other","flightPath":"Path
