at an unknown distance in the air off the interstate. it wasn't moving at all and had a bright light underneath it that was white orange/ sort of yellow. i saw it and tried to take a picture of it but it was too high up and there was traffic at my exit. at this time there were no clouds in the sky, just this strange object. i finished driving to school and figured that maybe it was a kite or something that had gotten loose. however when i got to the school i looked and it was still hovering, it still hadn't moved. i played sort of a creepy move but i needed to make sure i wasn't seeing things so i talked to a girl what was walking by and told her to look in that direction and tell me what she saw. she saw it too and did answer that it wasn't moving and that she didn't know what it was, but she didn't seem to disturbed by it. however that does mean i wasn't imagining things, and there really was some sort of stationary craft high above chattanooga today. i went inside for class and came out about 50 minutes later, there was now dense cloud cover in the area and i also saw fresh trails from planes laid in the exact area that i had seen the strange craft. \r\n\r\nas soon as i

i kept staring at it. it looked about 7ft tall just a shadow i could make out\r\ni was getting ready to walk to my left to go back to my trailer about 50ftto left was railroad tracks i had to cross to get home.To my surprise standing in front of me was a large wolfe. the wolfe was eating something so i looked to my left and right to see what was qoinq on. to my suprise i wasn't where i was supposed to be i was in a very large field like only thing i could see was tall looking grass\r\nso i looked too see where wolf was he was gone.I was standing in this field of grass not having a clue where i was all i know is i was frozen in a state of mind i couldn't move\r\ni felt like i was hovering above the ground not actually on the ground\r\ni could see the grass moving and i could hear a swisshing sound.I had to get out of there so i turned to my left and started walking. the next thing i saw was i was back to my place. i turned to look back and i didn't see the place i had been.I went home and wrote myself a note to say this didn't happen. the note was on the table when i woke up the next day.I never went over to the area after that i moved 6 months later.I do not have pictures.","distance":"101-500

thought to be a plane with blinking red and green navigational lights. i turned away from the object due to thinking it nothing more than that many planes that fly over due to living in flight path of local major airport (sky harbor). it wasn't until i turned back a minute later did i notice that the object took on flight characteristics not like that of a conventional commercial plane.\r\n\r\nit began to make a hard turn to the west from the south west direction it came but not at a complete 90 degrees. it then began to ascend and descend at differing diagonal vertical paths until finally seeming to hover an then jet off back in a se direction. once it did this it than began to hover in that area for a time of perhaps 33-45 seconds (according to attempted cellular video of the object). after doing so it than began to descend to a point where i could not see it and began to run around the building in my apartment to try and see if i could get a final view. i wasn't able to other than see it descend down in a se direction and disappear.\r\n\r\ni was quite anxious, excited, nervous and really at a lost to come to a thought of what i just saw. i thought perhaps it could be a helicopter but the movements it made before jetting to the se was like that of one randomly moving a cursor on a computer and not something you'd expect of a plane or helicopter.
