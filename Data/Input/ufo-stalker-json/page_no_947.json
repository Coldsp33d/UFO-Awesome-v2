lydney docks on the edge of the river severn in gloucestershire, uk. it was wednesday 9th of april 2014 and around 21:20 in the evening. we had been in the area since about 19:00 and the sun had set just over half an hour before, the skies were clear and as the sky became darker a good number of stars were visible.\r\n\r\ni first noticed a bright light in the direction of the severn bridge to the south-west, slowly tracking in a smooth arc to the east. the object seemed to be at a very high altitude and had no discernable running lights. with its apparent altitude and the time being so close to sunset, i assumed the object to be a satellite and pointed it out to my companions.\r\n\r\nfor roughly the next ten minutes we watched casually as it passed towards the east. as we did the conversation moved between satellites and other space-related phenomena. i remember stating that the only thing that could convince me that i might not be looking at a satellite of some variety would be a distinct change in direction.\r\n\r\nas the object moved further the east a dimmer light became apparent moving in an arc following the same trajectory. whether i noticed this due to a change in magnitude or simply my eyes becoming more light adjusted i am unsure, but after half a minute or so of observation it became clear that the this second object was in fact gaining on the first and would soon catch up.\r\n\r\ni duly pointed this out to my fellow observers only to have one of them point out a third object, of the same apparent magnitude of the second, moving downwards from above and on a trajectory that would bring it close to the first two. almost immediately after this i spotted a forth object, again of similar brightness, moving in a diagonal direction, as if to join the other dimmer lights.\r\n\r\nall three of the less-bright lights then appeared to converge at point behind the original object. for a couple of seconds all three dim objects seemed to remain still as the original passed along its arc from west to east. the smaller objects then appeared to switch places a couple of times before separating back out in an equidistant pattern similar to an equilateral triangle. one of the lights appeared to follow the original object in a rough trajectory before blinking a number of times and fading out whereas the other two simply faded as they moved further apart.\r\n\r\nfrom a personal perspective this was an awe-inspiring sight. having spent a reasonable amount of time looking skyward in the evenings, even being able to watch something man-made trace an arc amongst the stars is something to admire. this, however distant, i genuinely believe was something else; something beautiful.\r\n","distance":"Over One

on saturday 11th october 2014, at about 23:10, i went into my back garden to smoke a cigar. as usual, i sat by my garden table and looked up at the stars. it was a very clear night, i could see no visible clouds at all, only stars. after approximately 2 minutes of being outside i noticed a light moving across the sky. it looked to be a satellite, i see these almost every night and it was moving in exactly the same fashion as any normal satellite; i.E.- slowly, following a linear path. the light did not \"sparkle\" or glisten at all and seemed slightly larger than a normal satellite as seen by the naked eye, but not by much.\r\n\r\nafter a few seconds of watching the light it stopped perfectly still in the sky, almost blending in with the rest of the stars. i began to think that maybe i had just lost sight of this satellite and now my eyes were focusing on a nearby star without my realising. however, maybe fifteen seconds or so later, the light very slow began to separate. it took about half a minute for the light to split out into three separate lights. the three separate lights, all of the same size, brightness and colour, stayed perfectly still in a triangular formation for about a minute. they seemed different to any other stars in the sky, a little bigger and slightly brighter. then suddenly all three lights began to move again. each light traveled in a different direction, one (the \"original\" light) heading north, one south east and one south west. i'm not sure of the speed they were moving at but they had left my field of vision within about three seconds; they were fast. unlike normal satellites, these lights did not gradually dim out as they reached the horizon, instead they simply continued to travel at the same speed, in the same direction until i eventually lost sight of them behind nearby trees and houses.\r\n\r\ni stayed outside for another 15-20 minutes watching the sky and saw a number of other satellites passing overhead, none of which were like the three lights i had just seen. i saw a number of airplanes fly overhead but none of them were traveling at a speed anywhere near these other lights and, due to being about 11 miles away from east midlands airport, they were low enough to make out the noise from the engines as they passed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

near highway 22x) soon after arriving, we were overwhelmed with beautiful explosions of pyro-art, from various communities located within the vicinity! as well as a powerful thunderstorm which engulfed the entire north/east horizon... with loads of lightning, too. \r\n\r\nnow, to the north, airplanes arrive and depart on a regular basis...Given calgary's airport location, and we did see a few land n' take off. however, the information i will disclose sure does not support the physical behaviour of an aircraft crafted by man.\r\n\r\nwhile gun-powder diminished from the pyro show, the clouds grew sharper as the air drew pure. with a wicked view of the now featured thunderstorm, which was indeed heading west (towards us) we felt no need to leave. the view was spectacular!\r\n\r\nwithin 15 minutes after all the fireworks had ended, we noticed a rather bright, what a appeared to be an airplane at the time. thinking nothing of it, we continued to watch the thunder storm draw near. after 10 minutes of noticing the bright object in the sky, it soon became the centre of attention, though this time, all three of us had a true suspicion. \r\n\r\nthe object hadn't moved at all in that 10 minute span. in fact, it made bizarre diagonal, swirling, shaking and pulsating movements as it got brighter and dimmer. please advise, i cannot provide an approximate duration of the movements for we were all in disbelief at the time. though, near the end of our experience, the craft did become very, very, very bright, began to vibrate, then, became darker than the sky (yes, it was a black dot in the nights stormy sky), topping everything off, it then made a few more sporadic movements in its shadow phase, and shot off, disappeared, directly vertical into the cosmos. \r\n\r\nto this day, we are convinced that this was indeed an extraterrestrial craft, piloted by beings wiser than man. \r\n\r\ndisclaimer: \r\nthere is no way the object we saw, was a plane

 is it coming back?  are we ok?\"  these are the questions going through our minds. we really didn't know if we were in danger.  we're all alone in the woods.  there is no immediate help.  we don't have the use of any cell phones, no weapons... \r\n\r\nit was really an incredible experience. we all asked each other if this really just happened. it would've been easier to simply block it out.  it's pretty mind blowing to become aware of something like this. we all agreed we all saw the same thing\r\n\r\ni remember seeing a plane, and finding comfort in something i recognized and had an explanation for. \r\n\r\nwe were all still pretty scared. i wanted to influence the the mentality of the group before panic set in. so i started the music and built the fire back up.\r\n\r\nwe were all throwing logs on the fire when all of a sudden, a flight flashed and an object went streaking across the sky above us leaving a tail behind it.  \r\n\r\nit was tearing through the air and burning in bright colors as it lit up the forest below.  it began to fall into the canyon between the mountain we were on and the one across from us. as it fell, it exploded and burnt up in vibrant colors of blue, turquoise and aqua....  \r\n\r\n\"whoooow...... what was that.\"  jake said.  my only explanation was a meteorite. but i can't help but feel like this was directly related to the ufo.   i've seen hundreds of shooting stars in my life, but all have burned in colors of white or yellow, never blue. and rarely could i so much as hear one, much less be shook by its intensity as it burns up and explodes...\r\n\r\ndefinitely a crazy night. [name removed/cms/dr] was tired and laid down. [name removed/cms/dr] and i stayed up and waited for the sun to rise.  \r\n\r\nas we sat on the edge of the mountains talking about the experience, we witnessed two more ufos moving across the sky that night. the first was traveling at what appeared to be a very high altitude. it de-celerate, stopped, changed trajectory, accelerated, and then took off out of sight.\r\n\r\nthe second behaved in a similar matter\r\n\r\ni had a video camera with me the whole night. i attempted to record all three objects. the camera could not make out the lights in the dark. there is however a few  seconds in the video where the first object can be seen through the trees darting up, down, left and right...\r\n\r\ni'll never forget this night  i want to know what it was we saw, and would like to know if there were others that witnessed these lights around that time. i've done some research and know that many people have reported flying orbs behaving the same way\r\n\r\nthis is also not the first experience i've had like this.  i had a similar encounter with a ufo in australia. also witnessed by 3 other individuals where an object in the sky came down to us and disappeared\r\n\r\ni'm happy to share more information if anyone who reads this, and would like to talk to more  with people who take this topic seriously .\r\n\r\n[name removed/cms/dr]\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

read from a computer he was working on at carswell afb fort worth texas in the 1960s.  the subject of roswell new mexico had been discussed many times – i, stating that the facts strongly imply the government/military are flat out not disclosing the truth of the event.  j, would smile and say it was a possibility.  on his deathbed, j brought up the subject and said he accidentally came across computer files on the subject during his job at fort worth.  he claimed that there was a crash of a flying disk of unknown origin, there were bodies of an unknown humanoid creature, that there were other crashes including one in 1963 in which a craft was recovered.  he wanted us to know – he would be violating the secrets act or whatever top secret status he held by revealing this information but it did not matter now that he would be dead in a day or two.  \r\n\r\n\tmy wife c told stories of the small people who came to “play” with her at the swing and slide in her back yard.  this was in fort worth texas – the same time j, her father, was at the airbase – the same time some of the craft were, according to the computer file j read, at the fort worth base.  c use to readily talk about these strange small people who, by her description, match those of grey aliens, reported by abductees.  this all changed one night i shall never forget.  after that night, c never acknowledged saying any such story – claimed ufo and alien contact is bunk, will not examine any evidence and gets emotionally hostile if the subject is brought up.  she is derisive of others holding such beliefs and gets angry – her personality underwent a dramatic change, which she denies as well, but from that day forward, she was no longer the woman i married – something in her was fundamentally altered.\r\n\r\n\tthe event took place in the mid 1980s, but i have no exact date – i was frightened beyond words and felt no one would believe me – might even lock me up as insane, so i kept it to myself.  as i have read other accounts, i now think i can give a testimony.\r\n\r\n\tbefore i write the account of that night, i wish to state that i can remember two other times i have had potential abduction events – both before i was married about age 18 – both in the same year.  the first was at night listening to a real to real tape with headphones in my bedroom – the tape was three hours long and i had just started it.   i blinked and the tape was finished and the reel was going around – so three or more hours had passed in that blink.\r\n\tthe other time i woke and creatures were pulling by out of my body and through my bedroom wall – this was 1968 and i had never heard of any alien descriptions but the things pulling me through the wall match the alien grey description to a perfect match.\r\n\r\n\tone other significant piece of information is the continual attempts c and i had to have children, with miscarriage after miscarriage – seven in all.\r\n\r\n\twe went to bed and fell asleep – i awoke to my cat growling.  the cat was on the bed next to my armpit and she was hunched down, ears back and growling in threat or fear.  her gaze was fixed on the open doorway to our bedroom and as i became instantly alert i glanced at the time – one o’clock in the morning.  ruth, the cat, continued to fix her gaze on something i could not see, yet it was light enough in the room to see into the hall and all around the bedroom – i saw nothing.  ruth continued to growl and back into my armpit hissing, head lowered, ears back – she watched something – her head and gaze followed as if something entered the room, moved toward the end of the bed and around it toward my wife's side.   \r\n\r\n\twhen the cats gaze rested on the area next to my wife, about where her head and shoulders are, suddenly, without warning, c sat bolt upright and started screaming at the to of her lungs such as i have never heard her before.   such terror and such screaming went on and on – i was frozen with fear.  i don't know if i could not move because i was so scared or if i was paralyzed by something – the fact is, i did not move and i was experiencing such fear as i cannot ever remember.\r\n\r\n\ti do not know how long this went on – all i can remember i have now written – the next thing i can remember is being awake and looking at the clock – i did not fall asleep, it was like blinking my eyes and the time was gone – it was suddenly after three.  the time loss was the same as the event with the tape recorder – blink and hours are gone – same position in the room and all but i blink and time is gone.\r\n\r\n\tmy wife changed that night.  she will not talk about aliens, abductions, ufos, and is not open to the possibility of their existence – even though she was and had see ufos and aliens before that night according to her own accounts which she now has no memory of and denies and such things or ever telling such stories.  her basic personality changed that night – many things – how she thinks of me, how she relates to me, how she is as a person – all different.  i do not know what happened – the event fits certain other peoples experiences who are saying alien abduction but i saw nothing other than what i have related.\r\n\r\ni am certain that these are not the only times we have been taken, if that is what is happening.  i do not feel safe.\r\n\r\nwhat happened to us?\r\n\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":60557,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.64805259311244,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10122014-0017","longitude":-117.09294540950573,"occurred":419414400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

about eight p.M. or so, dark, but not completely dark. just enough light in the sky to cause an orange horizon. \r\n\r\n   my mother spotted them first, and brought them to the attention of the rest of the people at her party. there were several witnesses, about 6 or 7 people. i assume all had been drinking, but it was still a bit early in the day, so i would say drinking, but not intoxicated. \r\n\r\n  when i looked up in to the sky, i was floored at what i saw. i was looking at something you would see only in the movies. my grandfather was a huge believer and had witnessed u.F.O.'s before, so i was pretty familiar with them, just had not seen anything for myself before that night. all i could do is stand there and watch with amazement.\r\n\r\n   i seen 4 or 5 lights, all different colors (my memory is a bit foggy on the minor details, they might have been white lights...But seems to me they were of different color.) at around 500 to 1,000 feet in the sky, almost directly above our heads. if i had to guess, they were about the size of a wrecking ball, but from my perspective, they were the size of a basket ball. \r\n\r\n  so these lights were in the sky, seemingly playing \"tag\" with each other. i got the impression they wanted to be seen. they \"played\" with one another for about 20 to 30 seconds or so, swirling about, zig zagging around each other, then one at a time, shot straight up in to the sky at speeds that should have been a physical impossibility. they shot straight up and in to the void of the sky, one at a time. they shot up at roughly .5 second intervals of one another. they moved at speeds that were a physical impossibility then, and if that same exact event were to take place now, they would be moving at speeds impossible to achieve today. \r\n\r\n   i have not seen anything like it since then. i was 16 years old at the time. i am 39 now. they were not lasers, they were not helicopters or anything else man made. a person would have to be a complete idiot to think they were anything other than extraterrestrial.

either a deer or elk in the gallatin ntl. forest in montana at approx. +44.823916 -111.245975. there is a mountain called mt. hebgen near this area. \r\n\r\ni had spent a few days in april 2002 volunteering for an animals rights group and we were out in the field all day long - snow still on the ground; sunny days but cold nights. the cabin where we stayed was on the north side of hebgen lake road. during one of my volunteer days, i saw a dead deer along the madison river - clearly it had perished from the winter cold and had some predator marks on it. large wolf prints were abundant in the area; howls at night. elk and deer were spotted and lots of buffalo. \r\n\r\non the morning that i was to leave, i had a horrible urge to hike up into the mountains to the north of the cabin. i just had to hike. i got started early in the morning around 7 a.M. as the rest of the volunteers went out toward the hebgen lake area for another day of volunteering. the organization provides boots and snow shoes as well as other winter gear for volunteers in an outside shed.  i put on boots but chose not to use snowshoes because i did not think i would be out long and the snow was frozen from the night before enabling one to walk on top of it.  \r\n\r\nit had lightly snowed the previous night and there was about 2 to 3 inches of powder snow over the old, hard snow.  i marveled at the beauty of the snow on the evergreen trees.  my boots crunched against the frozen snow but i was able to easily walk on it though it was a bit slow because of the incline and also because i had to maneuver a bit through the trees.  after a while there was almost a path in which i could easily pass between the trees. i was heading north and to my left i could see some rocky outcroppings and as the sun came out, it hit these and made a beautiful site.  bird were chirping. for some reason, the fact that there was the light, fresh snow all around me was very much in my mind.  \r\n\r\ni have no idea how long it was before i came around a corner and before me was a clearing of sorts which looked like one could then go toward the left or proceed a bit to the right.  but in the middle of this clearing i saw a dark object and as i proceeded closer i realized it was the head of a large deer or small elk. i immediately became spooked because the snow all around it was untouched.  the powder-type show was pristine in that clearing and there was the head lieing there somewhat facing me as if someone had carefully placed it there. there was no neck.  no blood on the snow or on the head anywhere. the clean, pure snow really did spook me - the observation that there was no snow on the head added to my growing fright. i think it was around this point that i realized that there were no birds chirping.  it was extremely silent and i could hear my breath and i was sweating (most likely due to the hike).  \r\n\r\nthough i was scared,i actually crept toward the head and stooped down at the right, front side to look closely.  the ears were gone.  not torn out but as if sliced off and i recall that i could see a hole into the head where the right ear used to be.  the left earhole was not as visible from where i was.  i noted that there was no indication that the animal had had horns.  either a young animal or a female (deer or elk i just don't know).  \r\n\r\nthe eyes were missing, too.  cleanly removed in circles so that there were two blank holes.  the upper and lower lips were also gone so i could see the teeth. i tried to reason in my head that if a predator did it, it would be torn/jagged and not a smooth cut as this was. i do not know if the tongue was gone because the mouth was closed - just missing its lips. again, there were no prints of any animals around and the snow was pristine all around this head - it was in a clearing with no trees overhead.  \r\n\r\nanother observation that really spooked me was the fact that the skull had a perfect round hole in the top of it. i have to estimate that it was about the size of a half-dollar. it was cleanly cut - again, i thought to myself if a predator wanted to eat the brain, how in the world could it make a cleanly cut hole like that.  i could not really see down into the head but it did appear that the brain was missing.  the fur did not look decomposed - in fact, if it were not for these other oddities, the head and the fur looked to be in good condition. fresh. not old and decomposing or mis-shapen.  again, i compare this with the site of the dead deer on the madison river which had clearly been roughed up by predators.  this was not.  the silence was really getting to me. the fact that there were no prints or other disturbances around the head - the fact that it appeared to have been placed or dropped there from above - and the silence really scared me.  i remember backing up and thinking over and over in my head \"this can't be a mutilation could it?\",  \"this can't be a mutilation could it?\".  it was not a cow or a horse. it was just a head - not an entire animal.  but how could you explain such a sight and to put the final nail in the coffin, everything around had a light dusting of snow on it except for this head - no snow on it.  it was on top of the freshly laid snow.  it was as if someone was mocking me - i turned to head back to where i had come from.  the sun was out now and unbelievably, my feet were now breaking through the snow and it would go up to my knees or thighs as i had to push my way through the snow. slow going because of this. by the time i got back to the cabin, it was around 11:30 a.M. and i was exhausted.  \r\n\r\ni took off my boots and left them in the outside shed where all of the other supplies were kept.  i did not go in to say goodbye to anyone.  i just felt like i had to get out of there. i felt embarrassed that i had gone hiking alone without telling anyone (everyone knows you do not go hiking alone or not tell anyone where you are going) - and i also thought that it was stupid of me to not have used snowshoes.  there was just something strange about how i felt and acted when i returned to the cabin. my bags were already in my car and i was just concerned about getting back to ogden, utah in a decent amount of time (where my mom lived). i felt it was important to share this on mufon - i have been a mufon fi in so. ca for a couple of years now, and have never had the time to submit this. \r\n  \r\ni am hoping that this information will be helpful as more information is gathered on mutilations.  i have had strange experiences my entire life, but on that particular morning, i - truthfully - would have more expected to run into a sasquatch than a mutilated head which was the farthest thing from my mind that morning when i had that urge to take a hike.
