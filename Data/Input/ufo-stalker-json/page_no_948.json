(i used an electronic compass \"app\" downloaded to my tablet to determine direction of object). she and i were in our condo complex parking lot retrieving items from my car when she noticed it and told me to take pictures. this object would be over the pacific ocean which is located approx. 1 mile from my location.\r\n\r\n\"what did you think the object was?\" -\r\n\r\nsince this was about the 4th time we saw this in the same vicinity,we tried to speculate what it was. we are located in a flight path where planes take off and land at lax, (36 miles from my location), long beach airport, (17 miles),\r\njohn wayne airport,(9 miles), and ontario airport, (56 miles). having been here 6 years, i'm used to seeing planes in their usual flight paths and altitudes as well as police helicopters. additionally, planes and helicopters observed seemed to always have the same colors and direction of movement. we speculated the possibility of planes or helicopters but the movements, altitude, and color of lights weren't consistent with with what we've observed several times prior. we also discussed the possibility of a balloon, rc drone, and military aircraft. to my knowledge, i'm not aware of any military bases currently in operation in my vicinity with the exception of mira mar located in san diego located down the coastline approximately 75 miles from my location.\r\n\r\n\"describe object movement and motions in detail\" - \r\n\r\nthis object moved up and down, stays in one position,and side to side. from the photos, it appears to be rotating. the elevation appeared from my vantage point to be higher than where planes are normally witnessed in their flight paths but this varies +/- unknown elevations.\r\nthere was medium cloud cover this evening so it would disappear behind clouds and re-appear nearby the same location through cloud breaks. \r\n\r\n\"describe your feelings\" - fascinated,curious, not shocked because we've seen this object (or similar object) before so we keep an eye out for it randomly.\r\n\r\n\"how did you lose sight\"- cloud cover.\r\n\r\nplease note that some photos submitted were zoomed and cropped to obtain better view of object. also, pictures may show a street lamps orange light towards the bottom of the photos.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":60538,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.669127,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10112014-0015","longitude":-117.99673650000001,"occurred":1413078960000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1413096160000,"summary":"Glowing orange color, very bright, seems to hover and rotate.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/60538_submitter_file1__IMG20141011191822.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/60538_submitter_file2__IMG20141011191714.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/60538_submitter_file3__IMG20141011191743.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/60538_submitter_file4__IMG20141011185602.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/60538_submitter_file5__IMG20141011191645.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Huntington Beach, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:94031"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Clovis","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On october 9,2014, early thursday evening around 7:08 pm. i witnessed a bright orb directly above where i was sitting on my porch. i had my camcorder with me and was able to video this bright white orb moving slowly towards owens mountain.  i recorded the object until it went out.  when i went inside to review the recording, i saw a second orb leave the first orb.  that right there shocked me! what object does that, that i know of, none!

had just come out of a restaurant .. this was at about 2220 hrs.  and were walking towards the avenida de liberdade, on the north side of the river. we were approximately opposite the large \"christ statue\". we saw an elderly man who was clearly fishing at the bank. his rod was at rest. he seemed very exciteable, pointing up towards the sky. he shouted, in portuguese, and i am not good with portuguese, the other three are portuguese; he said \"the portuguese airforce has just headed that way\",pointing south across the river. he said 20 planes, had \"gone to bomb syria\". when we heard that we all laughed at him. i remember three or four dutch or german middle aged people had stopped, and asked in english what had just happened. i said, \"that man has had a little bit too much aguadente!\" they walked on, as did we. but about 50 yards further on, one of us (i think it was me who first saw it), told the others to \"turn around and look up\". what we all saw was the most extraordinary sight any of us have ever seen. a young portuguese couple were also present and were also stood still and looking up. now, all of us, us four anyway, would all independantly pass a polygraph test... any time, any place. to continue, what i saw (we saw) were a large amount of \"craft\" in the sky about between 1,000 and 2,000 feet up, maybe 2,000 to 3,000 feet away. it was so very clear. some of them appeared to hover for a while, others moved up and down, there appeared to be lateral distance between them all, but this was very much a formation. i do not believe i am writing this. i wish i wasn't. i say that one or two of them had a purple and green light in the middle. the others say they cannot recall that. they were all a diamond shape, from my memory, and all were outlined with a white light, light small white lights around the edges. one of my friends, both us citizens and responsible people with responsible jobs, thought that the objects were small \"drones\". however, they were all noiseless. and my view is that, with the distance from us, they would be the size of a saloon car each. the sky in front of us was filled with them. perhaps you have seen this before? i don't buy that drone idea, because military drones cost millions of pounds each, don't they? and 60 of them? i don't think so!. besides, the jerky up and down movement of some of them ... i think if it was drones they would have risked crashing. no they were not drones. the only other possibility was that it was some kind of projection onto the sky in front of us as a prank. but, we asked ourselves that question as it unfolded. we saw no beams of light from ground to sky. besides, the spread of these \"craft\" covered a wide area: too wide to be a projection. it all seemed very real to us. we were so gobsmacked that not one of us thought to take a photograph. we regret that. the craft were moving deliberately south across the river. i saw an airliner crossing, much higher than \"them\" heading south to north and crossing the river. i watched it and i tried to judge how quickly these silent craft were moving. they were much more fluid in movement and much much quicker than that aircraft. this whole thing seemed to last an eternity. i have no idea who the other couple were. we did not think to get their names. we have tried telling others of what we saw, but they too think we must have been drinking. yet we were all stone cold sober. i pass it on to you because it was too unusual a sight to simply ignore. as it unfolded, i turned to my friend, and i distinctly recall saying to him, \"are we being invaded j**n\". he replied, something like, what the hell is that. please e mail us whenever you like. i am sure that if you are a legitimate researcher then the others would not mind you having their email addresses. but i will wait to see if any of this is of interest to you. i would be even more pleased if you could offer me a rational explanation for this. thanks. lastly, and i have not mentioned this to the others, but i saw a smaller plane, climbing from a low altitude, already on the south side of the river, and it climbed into the clouds over there. i saw the, what i think is, the rear exhaust of the engine? and this was when the old man was speaking to us. only because at that early stage he was pointing south and we were looking. \r\neventually all of these \"craft\" shot off across the river, and disappeared into the clouds on the south side. on our side of the river, the night was clear and crisp. i didn't see any cloud on our side. all the best.

of relaxing entertainment. he tends to take his nikon coolpix p7700 out to take pictures of the different planes landing or of interesting clouds that form in the area. on this night, september 20th, 2014 we were enjoying a picnic dinner while watching. suddenly we noticed a break in the planes. there had been so many coming and going, but then it got quiet... nothing even in the skies around the airport. we thought it to be strange so we just waited. he decided to get a continuous shot (group of 6) of the buses across the airport from us as an nfl team was coming in for a 49er game soon. during this time, there was absolutely no planes on or near the taxi area or air strips. about 10-15 minutes went by (roughly) when planes suddenly started taking off and landing again like crazy! we thought it was odd, but joked that traffic control may have been busy talking to pilots at another smaller local airport. we got home that night and just continued on with life as normal. well... my husband was reviewing the pictures from that night just a few hours ago and noticed a circular shape object with a top dome light, windows, a red tail, white front lights and a grey base color to it! its very odd, in these 6 continuous shots (taken at about 1/10/second speed each), you can clearly make out this object moving just a few feet above ground across the center runway (airstrip) in the opposite direction that the planes were coming in at! it never changes shape, and keeps on a straight pattern. the only thing that changes in any of these photos is the color of the light on the dome portion of the top of the object. we never saw this to our naked eye, and never heard any unusual sounds. there was no unusual activity after the event either, that we saw. there were no helicopters, or anything else except normal commercial planes coming and going. we have zoomed in and looked closely at these images where you can see great details. to us, its irrefutable proof that ufo's do exist. there's no way to deny it.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Window(s), Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

bed.Went outside to look at full moon sat down and was just chilling.I am not sure when i noticed the blinking it was coming from my left and really resembled a few stars in a triangular pattern.Yet it seemed to be coming closer to me but still far off 2 or 3 miles maybe.The sky was totally clear the eclipse happened later in the morning.I am not sure how long it took but they broke off into a line and moved to the north of my house. where they reformed in a triangular pattern,still seemed to be far away.It was then that it seemed to change shape yet still remained triangular stretching out while pulsating and vibrating?The orbs stayed white but it looked like light was pulsating between them to form a full triangle.Inside it looked like you could see the sky  but not really,like it was cloacking in the center.I had an odd thought at the time had they opened a portal? at some point there were many more that showed up most at a great distance and acting similarly.I kind of felt mesmerized?Or hypnotized? time was odd,hard to describe.I had grabbed my camera sometime before 1:00am and kept thinking i should wake my husband and son.Was certain it would be gone before they could get outside so i did'nt wake them but started taking pictures sadly i did'nt know how to use the video mode.The pictures i got are weird in quite a few ways.Quite a few look black and i kept thinking its not working right.But it was like whatever is in the center of frame disappeared making space around it darker on close inspection there are orbs or stars in most of those pictures.The third picture i took is black yet at top of frame a grayish shadow of an orb is seen.All these pictures were taken with a fuji xp camera on telephoto unsure of specs but is fairly new and has wifi.In hind sight that photo really bothers me as i had not seen anything this close visually.On the blackened photos i never lost sight of the lights.There are a couple pictures in my set of 20 that the date is upside down as if i had turned camera i had not.The 5th frame is the view as it looked to me when they were'nt throbbing,morphing and elongating.I did not see all those that i got on film but did notice that the light seemed odd.The flash at the left in pic.#5 is from a basketball backboard.It was a full moon and it was brighter but this was different,indescribable.The 6th frame is similar only center is'nt what i saw visually as lights never left my site.During the time i was taking pictures the flash seemed to draw them closer in and i was getting paranoid so did'nt take as many as i wanted to,especially when i thought the camera was malfunctioning.I turned back to the south and took 2 pictures of the moon there it worked fine,next picture i had turned back to the north when that one was shot the camera was not turned upside down but the picture seems to have been taken that way.Took 2 more pictures of what seemed to be nothing so i walked inside and took a picture of my dog tony.Camera worked fine for him went back outside took 2 more of what i thought was blackness same as the others on closer inspection there are orbs/lights/stars in most of these pictures.I felt like it was not going to let me film it any longer so quit taking pictures and shortly there after went to bed.I never did wake my husband or son but knew they would be getting up before too long so left camera and a note on kitchen table about my strange pictures asking them to get pictures of the eclipse.There are 3 pictures of that and you can see orbs/lights in those they were taken to the west,off our deck.The next night i took pictures in the same spot but only to the south and east just as a comparison.That is a picture of a plane just to the left of the moon.The next frame is black in that series too did not see anything weird though.   overall the experience left me stoked and excited but in hind sight a bit paranoid as i've been left with the feeling that we are probably being watched more frequently than we care to know.And i am left wondering if there was more to my interaction with these lights as time and reality seemed to be altered somehow.I am pretty sure that they accessed my camera through its wifi but cannot say for sure how the pictures were messed with.  the experience lasted a little less than 2 hours yet i was surprised to see i took pictures for only 50 minutes of that time.When i was a kid about 1977 a group of neighborhood kids probably 9or10 of us were playing hide and go seek and we all had an experience with lights. they would stay in a line formation probably 7 or so lights about 5miles away at a sixty degree angle and would move strangely enough at high speeds that we knew what we saw was other worldly even then.I guess that might be why i never really was afraid but did get paranoid the other night when the flashes from the camera drew them closer to me than i wanted them to be.I could not post all the pictures i referred to so am sending 1,3,5,6,9,14,16,21 in the series i took on 10/08/2014.The 9th file was the eclipse taken at5:50 am on10/08/2014.10th file is taken on 10/09/2014 showing a plane in approximate area lights formed the night before.
