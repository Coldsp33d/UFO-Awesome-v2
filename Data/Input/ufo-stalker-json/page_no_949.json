4th of october, 2014.  the moon was not up.  the sun was 2 hours from coming up. it was a very dark night. we were flying about 1500 miles west of california at the time. i was looking out the windshield and saw a perfectly round, white, cloud-like form.  it appeared to be 80% above the horizon. it looked like a moon rising above the horizon but 4 times as big. the outer edge was brighter than the center. our flight path was taking us through the left edge of the form. the form was a perfect circle. i couldn't tell at first if it was a flat circle or a sphere. as we got closer, it got larger. we were at 39,000 ft. the upper edge of the circle was many thousands of feet higher than we were. i would guess 100,000 ft. or higher. we did fly through the left edge of this. as we got closer it diffused and was harder to see.  there were 2 other aircraft that saw the same object that night. one of the aircrafts was 40 min. ahead of us that saw it. because it was so dark i am not sure why we could see this. normally on moonless nights, clouds and such are not visible. i do know it wasn't the northern lights and it wasn't some strange cloud.","distance":"20 Feet or

i did and then i saw it right there in front of a low cloud. it like came out and went down about 25 feet then left about 25 feet then back then up and back again, then stopped and sat there. i was yelling at my wife and brother to come out here fast now! my wife was the first one yet could not see it cause she did not have her glasses on! then my brother came out and before he could actually look at it, it went into another cloud next to it. the funny thing is these clouds were kind of transparent so i do not know where it went it just went into it and vanished. at the time i saw it, it was a circular object just like a ufo to say. it was of a dark color yet you could see the sun hitting it. so it was there! but the moves were just to quick. it went from a straight down to a left turn in just a split second and did what i said above in the same time. but i did get to see it for the time mentioned above. it makes me wonder if it intended for me to see it. as when i walked out

lights moving very high in the sky, much to high for an airplane, some of which are likely satellites but it is impossible to tell. however, last night as i was preparing to begin mediation i saw what looked like a large undefined black spot, almost looked like static on a monitor, emerging from a large cloud. i actually rubbed my eyes twice trying to make sense of what i was seeing. as it moved closer the the static dissipated revealing a very large disc, my best guess at size would be approximately 100ft across, and the dark color gradually lightened until it was exactly matched to the cloud it emerged from, a flat primer looking grey  and it progressively came into sharper and sharper focus. it became sharp in focus but never fully became totally solid, it had a \"cloaked' look to it, i couldn't see through it, but it had a transparency at the same time. after it emerged from the cloud it made a wide arc in it's decent to the left turning fully sideways and flattened back out as it moved back to the right, it's path would've drawn a \"c\", it came to a brief stop and hovered for only a moment. at its lowest point and closest point to me it would've been only a couple of hundred feet away from me. after the very brief moment that it hovered it began ascending straight up in a spiral path directly into the brightness of the moon. as it ascended it became progressively more transparent until it was no longer visible. unfortunately, it happened and was over so fast i was unable to get any video or photos. i decided to make the report in the event it would provide

around 11:30pm-12:30am, i was out on my porch looking northwest where the smoke from the high park fire was.  i seen one craft, i am guessing disc shaped, hovering over what appeared to be, the southern end of the fire. the craft hoovered for well over a minute.  i seen a second craft not far from the first, but not two together. i seen the first craft slowely move before seeing a second craft in a different spot.  i cannot say if there was only one or two because of the movement they make. it lasted approx. two minutes or less before disappearing.  i spotted a same light off to the east momentarily after i lost sight of the western light. this happened over two years ago, i do not remember the details clearly, however i know what i seen and what it was.  about 4 weeks later, something happened that confirmed to me...What i saw.  a voluntary fire fighter showed me a photo of a burn area, just yards away from the forest  burn area that they could not explain.  the photo showed a perfectly rounded burn area that no forest fire could have created and he felt it was so strange that he took a picture of it. i broke down and told him of my sighting when i saw the photo.  he had nothing more to share.\r\nmy reaction when i saw the ufo:  i have always been hesitant to report any sightings because i am a private person and when you are told as a child in the 1960's, after you see a craft hoovering on top of your telephone pole, to keep a lid on it; no one talks about it!  i have seen at least 10 ufo's in my lifetime but i love the night sky. it becomes a part of

in the sky, far in the distance, i could see three airplanes skimming across the sky going various directions.  i knew these were airplanes due to the trails they left as they streaked across the sky.  these were quite a distance away as the only light i could see coming from them was the reflection of the sun off the planes. the sun was on the verge of setting, though not quite down.  there was another stationary light poised above the sun which i thought was a planet, possibly mercury.  then, from the left came an object that just appeared to be a light a bit brighter than the airplanes, but not much.  the sun was bouncing off of the object so i couldn't tell if it emitted its own light or not.  there was also another apparently stationary light just behind and above the direction the second object came from.  at first the object traveled in a straight line headed north, so i thought it could be a satellite or the space station but then it turned downward, made a misshapen 'u' shape then went straight again only to reverse back to the left all the while not continuing in a straight line, more of a jagged line.  i never saw the other two objects move from their positions.  the stop light turned green and i turned the corner, so the object was out of sight.  as soon as i got to the light at 31st and main i looked for the object again but houses were in the way, the time lapse between the turn and the next stop light was not more than a minute.  i turned onto main and continued home after roughly one minute, but never saw the object again, in fact all of the lights besides the three airplanes were gone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
