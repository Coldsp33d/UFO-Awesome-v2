[plus multiple witnesses] have had 7 \"orange orb\" sightings over pacific, mo since 2009, some stationary, some moving [single], some moving in formations [delta].  all silent, all absolutely the wrong color to be flying in us airspace.  i'm a quality inspector for boeing and have worked on or near fighter jets, and military/civilian airbases since 1980 and have never seen the likes of the orange orbs.  the attached pic i received from my friend was so intriguing i felt compelled to post it to mufon to see if anyone else witnessed these objects.  according to the person i received the pic from, his friend and another guy were making their way back to the boat ramp after a day of deer hunting along the missouri river.  the sun had set approx. 15 mins. earlier.  looking at the bottom of the clouds in the pic you can tell that the sun is reflecting off the bottom of the cloud.  this may be just a very cool sun dog-type reflection, but i was having a hard time explaining the chevron shaped group of lights above the cloud, and the 'way too evenly spaced' beams of light coming off what appears to be the sun shining down from the cloud.  notice that the beams are apparently reflecting off the river.  apparently the event only lasted seconds and was gone, but i haven't talked to the person that took the pic personally.  the \"orange orb\" events i mentioned earlier were witnessed by multiple people, but are not documented with pictures, and a completely different event[s].  i'm unsure if the person that took the pic would be willing to talk to anyone about it, but i could ask if you'd like to get more details about the event.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":88240,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.19841382981282,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11232017-0013","longitude":-93.19550399321362,"occurred":1511136000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1511440600000,"summary":"Pic

several miles and many times 'tail gated' me, untill on the approach to a village called vedrina, where he nearly collided with the back of my car.  i challenged his m.O. with hazard warning lights and break lights. he then backed off to 50 yards and a 'blue flash' occured, at first i thought it was traffic police pulling me over, but, there was no car at all. the car cmpltely dissappeared into thin air. i immediately pulled over to comply, but the car car dissappeared into thin air and no other traffic was on the road.  i did stop right away and walked up the road for a kilometer and there are no roads off the road we were travelling, only freshly ploughed felds.  i smelled a strong smell of ozone when i got out of my car.  and the 'blue flash reflected in all 3 rear view mirrors, which

pulsating lights that change colors, and they usually change locations slowly throughout the night. but sometimes they move away shortly after i start recording video on my phone, almost like they know. lol\r\n\r\nthe last few nights i've seen the same ufo in the same general area. usually stationary. sometimes it's just a orange or white ball of light, other times it changes between red and blue, and it blinks really fast while it's changing colors. it also looks like it's changing shape while it's flashing between red and blue.\r\n\r\ni live in lakewood by artesia high school, the ufo was up in the sky over the riverbed area by the city of la palma, or even further.\r\n\r\nthe other ufos i always see are in the opposite direction. they are over lakewood for sure, they can be seen when you look up towards the pioneer blvd and studebaker rd area. one of them has been here for the past 5 years at least, i've been seeing it almost every night for as long as i can remember. i've even seen it get chased by a helicopter one time.\r\n\r\nthis is the first time i reported a sighting, but they literally happen just about every night where i live. i've gotten used to it so i don't really try to take any pics or video anymore, i usually just wave at them or throw up the peace sign and say what's up.\r\n\r\nanyways, happy thanksgiving to everyone out there. happy holidays, and

disc-shaped object hovering above the clouds in a nnw direction.  at first i thought it was a star but being an amateur astronomer and astrophysics enthusiast, i realized that the light wasn't blinking or shimmering- it was spinning.  i looked closer and realized i wasn't looking at a single point of light but a circle of lights (multi-colored with blue, green, red, and white).  at that point i grabbed my brother who was standing nearby and pointed it out to him.  he saw it without me telling him what to look for. after pointing out the spinning lights, i then noticed a dim outline around the spinning lights that was only a little lighter than the sky (like it was camouflaged or highly reflective).  as we sat and watched it for a few minutes, we noticed that it hadn't moved an inch in the entire time we'd been standing there.  i tried to record the event with my phone but the object did not show up on camera (however the neighboring star did!) which struck me as very odd.  shortly thereafter, my brother proceeded inside while i felt an overwhelming compulsion to stare at the object, almost as if i were hypnotized.  after about 3 more minutes, i also proceeded inside.  in total, our sighting lasted about 7-9 minutes and the object was still there when i left.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":88215,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.76334651706354,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11222017-0010","longitude":-72.99648088045427,"occurred":1511299800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

\r\nwhilst walking down victoria road on my way home to rastrick, i noticed a strange light in the horizon. \r\nthe object was very dark against the night sky, but had lighting all around it. the object was triangle shaped, and had different lights such as red, green, blue, white and yellow. that changed randomly, it also seemed these lights were not static on the craft but they seemed to move too. \r\nas soon as i spotted the object, it immediately came closer to where i was walking, almost directly overhead. from the horizon location to where it hovered overhead must have been 3 or more miles. the craft made this distance in a matter of seconds and then hovered. \r\n\r\nwhen trying to explain how long this craft hovered directly above me is very difficult. i cant describe if this was a matter of seconds or maybe 5 minutes or more. all i can remember is a strange feeling, and feeling like what the hell is this thing above me. after a period of time, the craft then shot off towards the blackly / ainley top area and disappeared, it took matter of seconds to get to this area again before it disappeared. \r\n\r\nfrom originally seeing it, to hovering and then changing direction and flying off the angle must of been around 110 degrees. \r\n\r\nas soon as it disappeared i remember questioning on what it could of been. totally disregarding it could of been a ufo, but the more i thought about this the more i couldn't answer what it could of been. \r\n\r\nno aircraft i knew of could fly so fast, hover and then change direction so quickly. \r\n\r\ni proceeded to make my way home. which involved a long walk up a steep dark hill. i called my parents at the bottom of the hill requesting they came to pick me up. at this stage i felt terrified in walking up this hill that i had walked up hundreds of times before. \r\n\r\neventually my mum came to collect me, and wasn't happy. i told her the events that night and i was laughed at and wasn't taken seriously. probably thought i was making up stories to get a lift home. \r\n\r\nafter going to bed for the night, and waking up in the morning. \r\nthe first thing my mum said was sorry when i got up. \r\n\r\nwhen asking why, she informed me she had listened to the local radio station that evening, where they had a talk show phone in style show. \r\napparently many people called in and had described the exact same sighting to the radio station, in fact that many people mentioned it that the presenter tried to contact air traffic control who confirmed they were no aircraft in that area at that time. \r\n\r\ni left a report on a website back in 1999 when this happened, but cannot find it at all online. \r\n\r\ni still remember all the details as if it happened right now, something i dont think ill ever forget. \r\n\r\nwould love to hear from anyone who saw the same sighting, and also the reports on the local radio station. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
