the best analogy i can come up with is the blood return from a vein. dark, deep, demure red. as if that wasn't ominous enough, the other lights on the underbelly of the fuselage started to come into view. the large red light seemed to be centered in the middle of the craft which was triangular in shape. there was another red light at the leading point of the triangle: same shade of red but smaller by about half. along the starboard and port edges of the craft were 4 white lights running forward to aft. they were not quite in line with the red light at the point as may be expected. there weren't any lights running along the aft base of the triangle which made it hard to discern the exact line of this part of the craft.  \r\nthe fuselage itself was an flat ink black so its lines easily melted into the night sky. the overall outline of the craft was discernible due to the underbelly lights and to the barely visible outline of the craft. the red lights were solid and only slightly pulsating. the 8 white lights were strobing in various sequences and at varying brightness. they were running on and off like the lights on a runway and then they would slow down a bit and flash on and off at random at sometimes individually and sometimes in pairs and sometimes altogether. it made no noise and had a wispy short tail coming off its aft. this is depicted in the sketch provided.\r\nthe craft is traveling at an altitude of approximately 15,000-20,000 feet, and at a speed that would seem to make the concept of lift completely irrelevant to the flight of this craft. the airplane i work on achieves lift at around 150 knots during takeoff and must gain some speed to maintain that lift. i have no idea how fast this craft was traveling; i do know that it remained visible in my parent's backyard sky traveling in a straight line and sometimes standing still or hovering for 15 minutes. i know this because i made a point to look at the clock before returning with my mom outside in case we had any lost time. while the craft was hovering it remained completely still and maintained its altitude. \r\nmy mom and i had a had a birds eye view of this ufo. we had no doubt as to what we were viewing. i was scared, awestruck, frozen in place, and dumbfounded as to how serendipitous it was that i got to be outside as the craft passed over my parent's house. i felt the sensation of being watched by a formidable intelligence. i felt out completely bested by it on all levels really. knowing that is where the fear came from. the object hung around the back yard and just kind of mosied on through the sky to go over the roof of the house. my mom and i ran through the house to the front door and it was still on its southwest course but it was ascending a bit and accelerating a bit more. it went behind the trees and that was the end of the ordeal.\r\nto be perfectly honest, this is not the first time something like this has happened to my mom, myself, and some of my other family members. nevertheless, i am still left incredulous after events like this. i feel less in control of my life when the presence of these things are reaffirmed for me. i sketched a drawing of the craft the morning after the sighting with the help of my mom. i am not an artist by any means but it gets the general idea across. i may one day have the gumption to share the rest of my experiences but as you can probably tell, i am long winded and short on spare time being a nursing student working almost full time. i had to make the time for this account. i just felt like telling some people who may \"believe\" me and maybe feel like they aren't alone in their own experience. they-whatever they may be-are very real and not a figment of your imagination. lets just hope that at best they want to enrich our human existence and at worst they're indifferent to us primal and uninteresting beings. \r\nthank you for reading and the best to all of you.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am making this report for a friend of mine who wishes to remain anonymous.  while talking to her on the phone today she asked me what the light in the sky was last night.  i asked her where she saw it and she said in the vicinity of russel, ny.  in as much as there are about 20 miles between my location and hers i pointed out that i had not noticed it.\r\n\r\nupon questioning her about the incident the following is what i was told:\r\n\r\nshe was closing the attached garage door to her house (we both live in rural areas with few neighbors) when she noticed a glowing object which appeared to her as a plate would look if she were looking directly at the top or bottom of.  i asked if it looked like a ball and she agreed that it could have.  she heard no sound that she could associate with the object; however, while observing it she heard and saw an airplane's tail strobe and red port side wingtip light but could not distinguish the fuselage in the dark.  the aircraft she could hear the engine/prop sounds of and assumed (likely correctly) that it was a smallish turboprop commercial aircraft heading towards the ogdensburg, ny airport.  although it did not cross directly between her and the glowing object she had the impression that the glowing object was much farther from her than the aircraft.  the aircraft was heading north west and the glowing object was stationary nearly due north of her location.  when i asked her about relative sizes i asked her to reference the size of the plane and the object relative to the apparent size of the moon.  her estimation/guess was that the distance between the lights of the airplane were about 1/4 of the width of the moon.  her similar guess about the object was that it was about 3/4 of the width of the moon.  using the conventional 20/20 visual acuity resolution capability of 1 arc minute if her estimate of the apparent distance between the running light and the strobe of 1/4 of 30(arc minute size of moon) = 7.5arc min and estimating the distance between running lights and tail strobe at 20-25 feet we can approximate the distance to the plane using the approximate small angle formula s(dist to plane) = (length of plane)/tan(of apparent angle) or s = 22.5feet/tan(7.5/60) and s = 22.5/.002182 = (10313ft) or very close to 2 statute miles which seems reasonable.  therefore if her estimate of the airplane is reasonable then we can presume that her estimate of the angular size of the object was a reasonable guess and her estimate that it was farther away than the airplane is also a reasonable estimate on her part. using the above equation again and solving for size of the object assuming it was 2miles away we find: size obj = (2x5280ft)(tan(22.5/60)) = approx 69ftdia. any multiples of 2 miles will increase the diameter by such multiple. her impression was that it was much farther away than the airplane and somehow gave her the impression that it was large. at 10 miles it would have been about 345/350ftdia.\r\n\r\nshe watched it from the front of her garage for about 10 minutes then went in the house and closed the garage door. she then checked to see if it was there periodically about every 10-15 minutes from her front porch. after two or three checks during which she saw it, she looked for it and it had vanished. as far as she could determine it never moved from the initial position in which she observed it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":60472,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7256146,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10082014-0014","longitude":-73.9444977,"occurred":1412739000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

first saw the object moving in a south by southeast direction. it was a very light grey to almost white color and ovoid in shape. as i was preparing to enter a friend's car, i immediately pointed in an upward direction towards the object in hopes my friend (who was driving) might also see it. by the time i was about to enter the car i lost sight of the object and my friend did not see it at all. the object was traveling in a straight path, unwavering, for the entire time it was in view. my first thought was that it was a ufo since i could not possibly identify it and it did not appear to be in any way connected to the plane i first observed. since my friend never saw the object she simply scoffed at my mentioning i had just witnessed a ufo. i've had a keen interest in the subject of ufo's for well over 50 years, and while i am highly skeptical of the eth, i continue to believe research and investigation is warranted and feel all reports should be made to proper organizations. i

 he was also a non-believer but admitted he could not find any logical explanation for what happened.  the flight continued on without further incident.\r\n\r\ni did file a report with transport canada immediately on my arrival in oshawa later that same day.  several months later, they sent me a letter (which i no longer have!) that stated they could not find any logical explanation for the incident and put it down to unusual weather phenomenon.\r\n\r\nlake abitibi and north is extremely isolated.  there are no roads or communities.  the terrain is very flat (pre-arctic tundra).  why an “alien” craft would be in that area beats me?\r\n\r\nlondon radar (transport canada) should have the full transcript of the event.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":60457,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0650443,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-10072014-0032","longitude":-117.6465976,"occurred":1117960200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1412750885000,"summary":"Unidentified very bright white light, same height as my aircraft (8,500') without radar trace.","tags":["contact"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3411,"locationName":"Ontario, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:95378"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Chelsea","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I enjoy going out and watching the space station go overhead. i get emails when it is going to pass over. i got one tonight and went out. nice clear night. great for viewing. it (the space station) comes into view out of the west and as i'm watching it another light appears just north of it crossing it's path. from the new light's trajectory it was clearly above or farther away. it shoots across about half of my sky view super fast. much faster than the space station (which itself is moving very fast across my viewing area) like shooting star fast. but it is perfectly even, not twinkling like a shooting star and no tail. then it stops dead and just disappeared. i considered the fact that it could be a satellite but it was brighter/bigger and of course satellites do not stop.

iphones from different locations.    i'll have to upload pics if you are interested.  orb size and distance are hard to determine.  maybe it's an iphone abberation, except that it moves and in one pic is not there, and two different iphones recorded it from different location.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

out of nowhere.  she called my mom and her husband asking if there was anything on radar.  they reported no.  she started taking pictures of the storm with her cell phone.  she was hanging it out the window and just snapping shots as she drove.  my nephew was with her.  the storm was fast and powerful, she ended up having to throw my nephew in the ditch and covering him.  she then took pics of all the damage done by the storm.  she was at home telling the story of the storm, when her husband noticed a very clear picture of  disk like objects with a flame under them lifting off.  they have since returned and have seen nothing to show it was anything but a ufo.  i just saw this picture today, and can't believe they have never shown me it.  i took it and put it on my computer, but i am leery of sending it to anyone.  i know it could be worth money when they test it and say its a real pic.  i am a former veteran for 12 years, a police officer for over 2 years, and i now do security for federal buildings.  i have a secret security clearance for my job.  i am no crack pot nor am i a liar.  i am unsure what my next step is in this process hope you can help me.  i will show the pic to an investigator in person. like i said i am leery of what to do with the pic. my sister is poor and could use the money, but i am an enthusiastic person about this.  i knew it had to be shared.  please just send someone to look at it, and i promise you wont regret it.  thank you\r\n\r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

sky. i then realized that it was moving way too fast for the wind speed and the thick cloud cover above it was stationary. in an instant the cloud seemed to stop and condense itself into a sphere. it changed from a darker grey color to a bright white/transparent. it then flew directly at me and did and abrupt 180 degree arcing turn too sharp for any other thing i have ever seen in the sky.  it moved away at an extremely high rate of speed, gaining altitude until it reached the cloud cover and burned or pushed the clouds out of the way disappearing. it left a distinct arcing shape cut in the clouds. due this object's transparent/mist-like nature it would very easy for it to travel unnoticed.  it made me wonder if what i saw was some type of invisibility cloaking technology.
