go over at about 60 degrees moving much faster than the object i was observing. there were no flashing or blinking lights on the ufo, and after another minute of watching it as it moved i turned to

neighbors house, far away, came into view.  the light had 3 others with it, in a row, staggered, not straight, pusling orange light like a camp fire.  i keep binoculars in the garage and grabbed them. they appeared to be a flare, very bright, slightly pulsating, with a defined top area over it almost reflecting, like a balloon.\r\n\r\ni filmed them, two times with an htc one m8 smartphone. captured only 1 image and oddly one of the two films never saved, and one is only 2 seconds long?\r\n\r\nthe lights appeared to be moving as fast as a slow plane, like a cessna idling along in along in slow flight.  the orange was like a campfire on a beach.  the rear object began to flicker, then began a descent, straight down and blacked out, no longer visible, nearly immediately.  not a fast movement.  the lead object turned to the east (my left) heading towards north scottsdale.  speed was slow, turn was soft, sharper then a cessna, but not abrupt.  the lead object started to flicker and became hard to see, dimming until black, like it ran out of fuel (if it was fire).  the middle object had held its course, heading nw and then made a turn to the east also, same as the lead light, and then started to dim.  i was trying to find it in my binoculars when it dimmed out.  only the trailing light 'descended' while the others appeared to continue on.\r\n\r\ni went in to check my film and found one movie missing and one screenshot or photo.  the movie that saved was only 2 seconds long.  i know i filmed it two times, i know i filmed it for a little bit, at least quite a few seconds.  something malfunctioned.  i was also scrambling to film this before they were gone, so perhaps i may have deleted it some how.  but very odd that one was only 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nmy thoughts are, being into aviation and being a plane spotter, is that it may have been balloons, a prank hoax, as they appeared to be balloons.  they were moving, and it appeared odd that if they were moving, how, as the wind was very still, it had been overcast all day.  perhaps there was a wind up there, but there was zero wind at ground level.  very calm.\r\n\r\nthe objects appeared to be moving along slowly, no ups or downs, just like a slow moving plane, and two of them 'very much did change course', as though they turned or were buffeted by a wind going in another direction.\r\n\r\nthe size appeared to be 4 feet in diameter, but man, this was night.  very hard to say.  they appeared to be at least a mile away.  they appeared to be coming from central phoenx, were perhaps over bell or union hills road at about 56th ave when i first spotted them.  they were quite bright and big.  a landing light is quite small.  these were like big flames, but had a like transparent halo over them.  horizontal flight, not climbing or descending, perfectly horizontal, and moving.\r\n\r\nthats it.  nothing special.","distance":"Over One

lot at the front of the building facing highway 87. i noticed that there appeared to be a storm front coming my way from the north and thought it would make a good picture as the sun was beginning to be covered by the oncoming storm front.  there was clear blue sky on one side of the sky and a dark oncoming curtain of clouds on the other side. i didn't notice anything unusual until my wife downloaded the picture into our computer about 21 days after i took the photograph.  we started to look closely at the picture i'd taken.  first of all, we noticed the sky was full of rays of light from the setting sun and many of the rays were different colors, blue, red, white, etc. it was very beautiful. my wife then noticed a bright, white, luminous orb-like object which appeared to be hovering over the highway about 30 feet from where i took the picture. at first my wife thought it was just a reflection from some type of shiny,  reflective surface hanging from a shop window or something, but upon closer investigation we observed that the \"orb\" was not suspended from anything at all, but hovering by itself above highway 87.  i did not see this \"orb\" at the time that i took the photo. \r\nwe then began to look more closely at the surroundings in the photo and observed there were several small whisps of what appeared to be clouds above the mountain in the background.  we magnified the \"clouds\" and saw that the one on the far left of the photo resembled closely the classic saucer/disc type ufo, with a dome on top and what resembled landing gear or appendages of some type below.  upon looking at another \"cloud\", we saw that it, too, looked more like a saucer than a cloud because it was vaguely cigar-shaped and there appeared to be some type of energy burst (a circle) near one side of it. i don't know what that could be.  there is one other \"cloud\" that also resembles a craft of some sort, as when magnifying it the center becomes a solid block and the remainder of it seems to maintain the shape of a cloud. as i said, i did not see any of these objects until we closely observed the photograph after downloading it into our computer.  that's it.  there is a feeling my wife gets from looking at the photo that something is happening that cannot be seen, due to so many bright lights of different colors and the unusual cloud formations, not to mention the incredibly brilliant orb in the center of the photo, hovering above the highway.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Dome,
