(i am not positive it was a southwest airlines plane. but it was definitely a passenger plane. that i am sure of) i was able to get a good, clear look at the orbs for about 10 to 15 seconds. they were staying perfectly still. i had to look away for a moment to get on the ramp to the 405 south. then i kept looking. once i realized they weren't flares, i said \"holy ****\" out loud, and in that moment, they vanished. there was no smoke or dissipation. they just disappeared. like a tv screen turning off.\r\n\r\ni am not jumping to conclusions that these were aliens or some sort of super natural phenomenon. even though i'd never seen this before, something about it struck me as being perfectly ordinary. i wonder if it could be some sort of reflection from the ground or the airplane in the back, or st. elmo's fire on land. just because i haven't seen it before doesn't mean it's supernatural. i looked later that day for other reports. it was near the freeway and there were many cars on the road  so i can't be the only one who saw it. but my search didn't yield any results. \r\n\r\nfyi -i was not able to take any pictures, as i was driving at the time. the picture that i have attached to this report is a screen grab from a youtube video. it is attached only as a reference to what i saw, since what i saw is almost exactly the same as what's in the picture. i just want to reiterate, i did not take the attached picture or any picture of what i saw. the only difference between the picture and what i saw is that the orbs i saw seemed to be a little further away from each other than they appear in this picture. but they were still very close to each other. if you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact me.

am i saw what initially looked like a flock of birds but the proportions of the individual objects didn't appear to be birds after looking for another second or two. my boss was standing in front of me, talking to me, so i was trying to give my attention to her and to the objects.\r\nthere were about 20-30, bright white, slightly silver, extremely reflective objects. about 300 feet from me, moving in my direction slowly, moving in a not-straight line. they were moving too uniformly compared to every other bird sighting i have seen. after about 5 seconds they flew out of range of the window. my boss was still talking to me so i couldn't run outside, but i knew i had seen something strange.\r\nat about 12:20, i happened to glance out the window again. something reflective caught my eye, and after focusing in on it, i could tell it was the same objects i saw earlier. they were further away than before, maybe 6-800 feet (the opposite direction they were moving earlier), and were going in and out of transparency. they were in a tighter, more uniform formation, nearly spherical, but still seemed to float slowly this way and that, without a clear direction. i reached for my phone while keeping my eyes on them. they must've gone in and out of transparency 4 or 5 times in the 15-20 seconds i kept my eyes on them. i ran outside to get a shot and they were gone. this has left me very uneasy.\r\nafter doing a little research, the closest comparison i can find is the youtube videos that show ufo 'fleets'. it is almost exactly like those except i only saw about 20-30

bright and apparently large light (or object) coming from the south west and heading north east, in a straight line. my brother seen it at the same time, when i alerted him to the sighting. i went inside my front door, and picked up a 10x50 binocular and continued watching the object. we both observed it through the binocular, and there was no blinking lights what so ever, just one huge bright light! it reminded me of the space station that i had observed on 3 different occasions. you couldn't see many stars, because the moon was so bright, and this was the brightest light observed in our whole field of vision which was quite large. even on a dark night with a lot of stars, this would have been as bright or  brighter than what i remember the space station being. we thought it must be a large satellite, and maybe in fact, even the space station. it was moving fast through the sky similar to what we would expect a satellite to do, but it was so big, we thought it must be fairly close to the earth, and of course between the earth and the moon. to our surprise, as we watched, it was heading straight toward the moon! so i got ahead of it with my binocular, and focused on the moon, so i could hopefully see a silhouette of it, or at least just see it pass in front of the moon. as we watched, the object was approaching the upper part of the moon, but when it got to the moon, it didn't go in front of it where i could see it, it went behind the moon and as we waited the second or two it would have taken to come out on the other side, it surprisingly didn't! my brother said just as it got to the moon, it appeared to him to have arced slightly and then it disappeared behind the moon. we watched for the next half an hour, and nothing was observed coming from behind the moon. there were many high altitude plane flights, going through the skies, during our observation period, and all of them were much, much smaller and not even close to the brightness of the object we were watching. also, all the planes had the blinking lights you always see on air craft. it was obvious to us, that if this object was indeed at the same distance from earth, as the moon, then it had to be a very, very  large object. this sighting cemented my belief in other intelligent life in our universe and that there is absolutely something going on, on the moon! i'm glad i witnessed this with my brother, so i would have back up to our sighting. we weren't drinking, or doing any kind of drugs, and we were totally sober (i don't drink or do drugs)and fully alert. i am 65 years old, and my brother is 46. this was quite an eye opener to both of us!  there surely had to be other people that observed this also. thanks....","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

300mm zoom lense. i started snapping photos and took a short video as well. i knew that it was not an airplane, helicopter, blimp, or hot air balloon. sky was clear except for some high cumulostratus

cloud did. it pretty much hovered and might have moved slightly north from the south. the object was viewed near sunset and i viewed it until i could no longer see it. i breifly looked a way and could not find it again. it got fainter and fainter the darker it got. that lead me to believe that is was ascending. my wife, sister, brother-in-law all, father-in-law, and mother all saw it. my brother-in-law and i kept going back and forth about it being a weather balloon. i decided it couldn't be one because it was not moving with the clouds. i'm a private pilot and researched winds aloft after taking photos and my brother-in-law's weather balloon therory didn't add up to me. i thought is could have possibly been a planet. venus would have been the only thing that i thought it could have been. i pulled out google sky map on my phone and venus was setting to west with the sun. no other planets near this object. in my video i can see the object under clouds. the images im

the objects were perfectly round white spheres that appears to be made of soft white light and gave off a dull glow.  they did not appear metallic or disc shaped and were perfectly still and motionless.  after several more minutes my wife then noticed that there was a third object exactly the same size, shape and color as the first and second objects observed.  at this time we realized the three objects were aligned in a north-east to south-west straight line formation all at the same altitude and equal distance apart from one another.  we began to take video and photo documentation of the event and were also at that time a bit on edge and fearful of what we had seen.  over the next several hours all three objects moved together very, very slowly in a south-west direction maintaining the same altitude until they disappeared from sight.  the pattern of movement, albeit very slow, was such that the three objects moved in unison in a straight line formation keeping an equal distance from one another -
