(it was late evening). \r\n\r\nthen, whatever the object was that was rising into the air on this zig-zag course ... suddenly exploded! we were just children, but we knew something important and just happened. i remember that we went running back to the house, darlene holding on to my pockets, and calisa holding on behind her. we were all yelling, “emergency! emergency!” (lol).\r\n\r\nby the time we got back to the house, the sun had set and there was no sign of the explosion in the sky over the mountains. at least ... not at first. then we started to see a huge cloud of blue green (gas?) hovering in the sky above us. it seemed to slowly pulse. i remember my mom & dad and my grandmother came out to look at it and we were all baffled by whatever it was. \r\n\r\ni heard later that there was a short article about it in the local paper, but no one knew what it was. i have not been able to find any reference to this article, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nat the time, i was not thinking “ufo” or

air at the time, which must have seen this too. planes were heading to john wayne airport and tustin police helicopters were circling over the i5 at redhill av. in tustin. ca. my sense is that the object was very large and faraway. even in relationship to the aircraft heading to john wayne airport, it was small, yet bigger than a bird, and clearly outlined with a defined edge. the commercial aircraft had to have seen it too, but it would have been west of their flight path.\r\n\r\ni was headed out the common driveway of the complex where i live when i saw this object silhouetted against high cirrus clouds about 6:30 p.M. it hovered and wobbled and remained stationary in one place for about thirty minutes.  i drove and finally got out of the car to view it at the corner of nisson and redhill. with my naked eye it seemed to have a classic saucer shape with a rim and a dome, yet at other times it appeared oval and elongated. again, i had the sense that it was very large and far away. it was at about 40 degrees above the horizon and it is hard to estimate the altitude compared to the aircraft which were very low and visable, in descent to land, as this area is under the flight path to the john wayne airport. since the sun was setting behind it in the west, the object was clearly silhouetted as a shape, but not dimensional.\r\n\r\ni watched it for almost a half hour, but no one else was watching. traffic heading north on the i5 at this time would have had a perfect view. i am not ufo crazy, yet i always keep my eye on the sky having seen something spectacular many years ago. at first i thought \"drone\" but this was far away and solid and stationary. i had a feeling of wonder and awe. i had to leave it because i had an appointment in irvine, but driving north on culver about 6:40 p.M., i looked west at the interesection of walnut avenue and it was still there. i am so sorry i didn't have my camera.

witnessed this too. as we were watching, another identical object approached from the same location as the 1st (just miles from a nuclear plant), and was on the exact course as the first, flying directly over our home. we watched as it flew in a northeasttward direction, toward the river. then, one after another, they came, 5 in total, all on the exact same course, disappearing over the

(we left the campground early and actually drove through breckenridge about 9:40 am, although we didn't see anything then.) i had taken a gps reading at our camp site... 39.07745,-106.13648. looking on google maps, breckenridge is located just a little east of due north of our camp site, exactly the direction i was looking when i saw the light. it appeared to be in the far distance, and very easily could have been near breckenridge at the time, although that's just a guess of course. while writing this report i was guessing an elevation angle of perhaps 20 degrees, but after measuring from my head location to the window and doing the math, the top of the window elevation angle is about 60 degrees. so my guess is the light descended  straight down from 60 deg down to about 45 deg in  a couple seconds, hovered there for maybe two more seconds, then descended smoothly but quickly on down to perhaps 20 or 30 deg elevation angle, where it stayed for the next full minute while i contemplated what i had just seen. the direction angle of my view (just a tad east of north) was deduced from google maps satellite view, the angle of our parking spot, and the direction i was looking across the inside of the parked vehicle.  i wasn't going to report this sighting, but it might provide additional evidence for whatever was seen in breckenridge early today.  at the time i'm writing this, 9news only reports three shiny objects in the early morning sky above that town.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":60314,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.0788819,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10032014-0017","longitude":-106.1366856,"occurred":1412337600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1412379039000,"summary":"Star-like light in night sky descended, hovered, and then repeated","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Buena Vista, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:96844"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"San Antonio","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In my back yard taking photos of deer.  it was dark -
