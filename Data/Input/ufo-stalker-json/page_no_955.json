(the two red lines close to each other point to the area covered by the zigzag). the far right red line points to where a direct line reverse trajectory indicates direction of origin of craft #2.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":60295,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.99853291770038,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10022014-0021","longitude":-94.33244469035019,"occurred":1411322940000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1412317443000,"summary":"Five objects i one day","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files/60295_submitter_file1__Whitecraft1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/60295_submitter_file2__Zigzagcraft2.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/60295_submitter_file3__Craft3.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/60295_submitter_file4__Craft4.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/60295_submitter_file5__Craft2zigzagcomposite.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/60295_submitter_file6__346degreesgreycraftorigininlakecropped.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"64064","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":11,"locationName":"Lee's Summit, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:96893"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Waltham Abbey","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving from epping to loughton,through epping forest, when i reached upshire i saw a tiangle shaped craft pass overhead,it was matt black underneath with green & orange lights.There was no sound the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.I pulled over & watch it move in a nw direction it was moving smothly & slowly the forest was silent & there was a strange feel in the air. the craft moved slowly across the tree line.I moved further down to get a better veiw but it had gone.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":60294,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.691782,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-10022014-0020","longitude":0.049593,"occurred":1412249400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1412298582000,"summary":"A triangle shaped craft passed overhead.","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"IG10","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Waltham Abbey, England","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:96894"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Noumea","country":"New Caledonia","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Before working in city of nouméa, it habit mine go windsurfing for one hour in early morning.\r\nmy spot is usual anse vata to off land island ilot canard. with trade winds is very common wind in morning.\r\n\r\nso one morning i is doing usual hobby when seeing something different me used to. the water is calm in morning and very like pool. i see after jibing three black spot in horizon coming bigger from direction of mont d'or which south east my position. i not understand, finish at ilot canard jibe again but looking back and see is three globes closer me. i jibe again ( jibe is 180 degré turn in water surface in windsurf) close beach and viewing the golf ball size sphere black coulor with maybe like airplane windows and people in back. they seem looking me!

night and i was walking home at about 1 am with my friend we stopped at a play ground to talk. we climbed up on top of the wooded “castle” structure at the park. i noticed a light blinking on the horizon far off, i thought it was a star and inquired about it. (i was from up north so in fl where we were, you could see many more stars than i was used to) my friend suggested it was a satellite. then we noticed it was moving across the sky slowly, and it peaked our interest we watched as it came closer and we noticed its flight pattern was not straight (like a planes would be) but slowly in a zig zag pattern as if it was hovering back and forth some distance each way. slowly moving back and forth east to west but in a continuous southern direction towards us ( i would estimate this came from many miles away from us based on the clarity and size of lights from the beginning of watching it to when it came close.  it slowly came closer maybe 30 minutes went by we watched it the whole time. at first we could only see lights blinking but as it got closer it looked to be three lights (two white one orange i think) either blinking on and off one after the other along the “edge” of the craft or possibly the edge was moving. (i am not sure) the rest of the craft was black and made no sound that we could hear. the craft seemed to be flat on top and bottom though it was difficult to determine as it was black and nighttime.  as it got even closer we could no longer see the lights on the edge. we could just see the underneath (which was completely black) and the only reason we could see just how huge it was, was because it blocked our view of the stars. it flew directly over us i cannot judge how far up it was because it made no sound to relate to. but if it was low it was completely blocking at least about the size of two foot ball fields worth of stars out. if it was higher up it was even bigger… it was very big and a solid shape (i think i remember it as triangle but it could have been a rectangle moving with one of the corners forward. it was completely silent; if we did not watch it approach i am not sure we would have noticed it. \r\nwhen the craft was directly over head we got scared and jumped down to hide underneath the wooden castle, because we thought, ‘if we could see it could probably see us.’ (we were both about 20 years old at the time) we only stayed under the structure for about 20 seconds but i can’t remember watching it leave at all. i just remember him and me standing at the edge of the park talking about how amazing seeing it was and talking about “did we really just see that? i don’t think we lost any time i got to my house about 2:20 am which was about a 5 minute walk from the park. \r\nour location is the blue blurb in the map i sent.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

parents house. at apx 8 am on sunday morning a neighbor called to tell us to go outside and see what was up in the sky. at this time of year most mornings there is broken low cloud cover traveling from s.E. to n.W.Clouds are moving at a fast clip. directly overhead there is an object that is stationary and directly over us. looking at the bottom of this object it is glowing an almost ultra-violent blue. however there was a black circle in the center which takes up apx 20-25% of the area. we watched this object for almost an hour and it did not move. we were about to go back inside when we heard a deep rumbling sound. flying in from the south east toward the object was an u s air force aircraft. we could see it very clearly following the engine exhaust even though it was painter camouflage and flying thru the broken cloud cover. the plane ( i found out a couple of weeks ago was a martin/general dynamics rb-57f canberra. these were converted b-57 bombers, there were 21 built.) we were able to track the plane by the engine exhaust, this plane had the engines on each wing. this design is how i was able to identify the type. all other planes types had engines mounted inside of them. the jet flew by the object on the east side at apx 500 + ft. distance from object. the engines turn off when the plane was apx 300-500 ft distance came back on when the plane past. the plane circled and passed on the opposite side of object. same thing happened with the engines. what was so noticeable is that it appeared that the engine cut off like a light switch, no sound and no exhaust until the plain was past and then turned on again. i did not know jets could do this. according to information about this plane some were stationed at webb afb texas. the plane flew s-east and we could hear the engines increase speed. the object was near the broken cloud cover but did not move for at least one hour. we last saw it at apx 10 a m and it had moved away apx 3+ miles to the east side of town. we could then see that the top structure was bell shapes and bright like stainless steel. the sighting made the news and the next day the air force said it was a weather balloon. why would a balloon stay stationary near rapidly moving cloud cover for over an hour, and why would the air force send one of their most advanced aircraft to look at a balloon? and when we last saw it, it had traveled cross ways from the wind direction and had not seemed to have gained altitude. something else i discovered, the object was apx 2-3 times the size of the aircraft. this made the object rather large. compared to air plane size : rb-57f canberra / converted b-57 bomber / 2 man cock pit crew wing span 122+ ft. / vertical tail stabilizer 19 ft. this plane was used because of the operational ceiling 65,000+ ft. also i read that there were additional crew within the plane up to 7 additional crew as needed to operate equipment.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

except much larger, and slower. then i thought of the meteor over russia. as i watched this object, i had time to think how big it appeared, and that it was traveling silently.  it lasted several seconds, 4-8. as it moved across my field of vision the tail seemed to be sparking, or breaking off in pieces.  it was close enough that i expected to hear a crash, as it seemed to be traveling in a downward direction. as it travelled behind structures and out of my sight,  i thought i should go see if i could find it, thinking that it would have come down very close. i did not go though. i do not know what it was. i know it was not a simple falling star. it was way to big, and moving way to slow.
