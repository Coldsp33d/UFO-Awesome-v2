calls. i will be there for many hours.On that day(sept.7, 8.Oo pm evening)as i was in phone,suddenly i saw something is travelling from east to west.At first i thought it may be an aeroplane.Later i realised, there is no aeroplane line on that day except friday and sunday. and that too it looked absolutely as it is star(star size with white light) is travelling and without sound that is not the characteristic of aeroplane.After sometimes it returned and flew in the same path.Then i went down.\r\n  the next day i saw this in the same path at 7.00pm evening.The same object i think,but i couldnt see the shape since it is dark.I confused whether it is ufo.I scared and then i decided to not to go to the rooftop for about a week.Then after a week,i went up.It was dusk as day is started to vanish.I stood there and gazed over the sky..Within a minute a red randomly blinking object flew in the same path coming from west to east.With no sound.It was too fast that it came from far and flew in the same path.Then i immediately went down terrified that it just surveiling me.\r\n  after two days i went up to just look if it is there or what.I saw it flying in another direction which is closer to my house, not far enough.It was with blinking red the same i saw before two days.Then i realised that it is continuously surrounding our area during evening.I really got frightened as it may abduct. i informed to my husband but he never took it seriously.I couldnt sleep at night thinking of it and fearing of it.\r\n  then after two days i witnessed it at the beach area the same type.And it was also during night.I wonder people never seeing this.It flew to some distant blinking red color and stood still.So everyone could not recognise easily as it seems as a star.I did not go outside frightening this. on sept.30,9.30pm evening, as i opened gate for my husband who is about to park vehicle inside as he came after outing, i saw the object absolutely facing me seems very nearer to me and directly behind my husband(about to park the vehicle inside). it has no sound and standing stationarily blinking red colour. i could not find its shape due to this blinking light. but i think it may be dome shaped. stood for only 2 minutes and i couldnt notice how it vanished. as he parked inside we immediately went up to see this. but couldt find it.I was totally scarred as it seems surveilling me or looking for anything around that area. i couldnt believe this and really concerned as it may abduct me.","distance":"21-100

from the previous night's meteor shower.  i looked west just over my neighbor's two story house and i saw what looked like a pulsating light sort of surrounded by fog, although not entirely.  it was sort of like an egg lying on its side shape.  i could not see any wings or other shape, just this light that was just pulsating.  it didn't move except to pulse.  it hovered for a few minutes, then it slowly descended down behind trees and i lost it.  there was no sound.  it was about the height of a helicopter or lower.  not as high as a plane.  there was no light coming from the ground like a laser, nor any light going down to the ground from the object.  i did not go get my camera because i didn't want to lose it and wanted to see what it would ultimately do.  \r\n\r\ni had no idea what it was when i first saw it.  too low to be a star or plane.  no sound to be a helicopter.  plus there was only a white light, no other colors.  and it had a steady pulse and it was just basically standing still in one place.  \r\n\r\nsince it was totally quiet and dark out i didn't want to try to chase after it.  also it was hard to judge how far away it was.  it seemed it could be over the next street but it was hard to  tell.  \r\n\r\ni live by topanga canyon and there seems to be a lot of activity around here.  i've had two other experiences, one with another person where we were driving on topanga canyon coming out of the canyon and we saw what looked like headlights coming toward us straight away.  as the lights approached we couldn't figure out what it was because we saw nothing but lights and the lights just separated and went past us on either side.  this was several years ago. \r\n\r\nanother time a few years ago four of us were returning to woodland hills around midnight on the freeway with absolutely no traffic.  a lot of fog.  we exited the freeway and was sitting at a red light by the motion picture home on mulholland highway when a light seemed to go between the front and back seat of our car.  all four people in the car saw it.  afterwards i felt like a metallic taste in my mouth.  we don't know what it was.

husband and i pulled off the hwy. to explore the beach.  we were in an area notorious for very high winds and this day was no exception.  there must have been a low cloud cover because the sky was void of color and was a sort of misty white.  i started taking photos before we got to the beach.  when i looked up i saw this oval shaped craft that seemed to have a slightly bowed bottom.  i haven't seen anything like it and it didn't look like a blimp and it was definitely not the shape of a weather balloon. i said to my  husband \"my god\" do you know how big that thing is?  i saw no lights but only this white craft against a whitish background.  despite these horrific intense winds it was motionless and, from where we stood, it was soundless.  we went down to the beach for a short while and when we got back, to my amazement, it was still there.  my husband said \"let's get outta here\".  i drove.  we proceeded south down the 101 and my side of the windshield turned white.  it wouldn't clear inside or out. there seemed to be some sort of substance on it because i could hear my wipers scrape it.  my partners side was fine and i was driving in the blind. i could hear vehicles whizzing by and the only way on this curvy road to navigate was by sound.  i rolled down my side window but i couldn't see through the white nor could i see the road at my side.  i listened how close vehicles were on the side of me and in back of me.  for the life of me i do not know how i navigated the curves on this road without going over the side and off the edge.  when i travel a considerable distance like this my windshield cleared up quickly and i thought \"my god, i'm alive, i'm alive\".\r\n\r\nwhen we got home i turned on the news immediately and, just as i did, the news reported that witness have seen a ufo in the same area that i photographed the image that i am enclosing. i looked at my photo but i believe due to the lighting the image didn't show in the photograph.  i started messing with the brightness and toned it down a bit and lo and behold there it was.  within this same week another ufo of a much different shape was reported in northern california.  the picture of the california ufo was borrowed from another site but none-the-less it looked exactly the same.\r\n\r\nin order to finish this report i needed a month and day but i don't remember what they were so i'm just posting something.  we were on summer vacation.\r\n\r\nin the first two pictures where the ufo appeared over the bridge the pic on its side is the original, in the second one the brightness was toned down which reveals the ufo and the 3rd pic is the image that looked like the ufo reported in california.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":60241,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.7249025,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09302014-0031","longitude":-123.3518856,"occurred":1218870000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1412146704000,"summary":"Ufo

was at the bocco mtn blm recreation site nw of wolcott co, lat.39'44\"29.35n, long.106'42\"21.14w. i often go here to do sky watches as there are no visible lights that can be seen from here, and it is also an area where there have been a lot of ufo sightings over the years. i parked my pickup truck facing east, and i was sitting in the cab with the motor off when at about 2235 i observed a bright light rise from behind a ridgeline to the east. the ridgeline is about 8900' and 9-10 miles away. at first i thought it could be an aircraft on approach to the eagle county airport, which is about 14 miles west. as i come out here often i have seen aircraft in this area with landing lights on that pass to the south of this location.\r\nas i watched the light ascending, still thinking it might be an aircraft, a second light came over the ridge that looked identical to the first. i now thought this was strange to see two aircraft approaching at the same time. as the second light ascended following the first one, the first blinked off as if someone had thrown a switch. as i have seen similar ufos behave in this manner, i got out of the truck and took four quick photos with my i-phone before the second light switched off. i grabbed my 7x50 binoculars and scanned the area where i have seen the lights and could not see any flashing or blinking lights that might have indicated a conventional aircraft. the lights never got higher than 10-15 degrees above the ridgeline.\r\nabout 10-15 minutes later a third light appeared off to my right, in the northeast, that i observed through the drivers side window. this light was much larger and much closer, and moving west about 50 degrees high in the sky. i estimate it was only 3-4 miles away, and i watched it for about 15-20 seconds and started to get out of the truck to take photos of this object when, like the other two, it suddenly switched off. there was a bright moon this night and the sky was completely clear in this area. there were no blinking lights to indicate a conventional aircraft of any type.\r\nsome minutes later a 4th light appeared again to the east where i had seen the first two, and this too ascended and blinked out after about 20-30 seconds. i have been watching the skies out here for 33 years and been in mufon for 15 years and believe these were ufos/alien craft.\r\ni cropped the photos before sending them to you. as you can see there are no other lights, such as an aircraft must display, seen in the photos.","distance":"Over One

someone like myself saw what was on that monitor and the show had to go off the air immediately.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

noticed to the north/northeast a much brighter than normal star.  i had initially assumed it was a plane crossing into the horizon.  i asked her what she thought it was and she got out of the truck as well.  we both stared in wonder as the pill sized bright orange glowing object slowly trolled right over our heads and into the south/southwest sky.  it was high enough up that we couldn't make anything out except that it was spherical and bright orange, and it was low enough to be confused with a plane.  it made no noise that we were able to hear and moved very slowly.  this was no plane,

lives you can see straight into space and see all the constellation, it's beautiful out there. one night after eating dinner i went outside to relax and stargaze with my 6 year old nephew, i was showing him and trying to teach him about all the different star constellations that we can see from earth. so the first constellation of course was the big dipper, while i was pointing in the sky to the big dipper i noticed to star-like objects appear in the middle of the scoop of the big dipper. i even said to my nephew that it looked weird that those 2 stars are out of place and shouldn't be there, i thought to myself maybe they were there but i couldn't see them because of the city lights where i live. i kept looking around at a couple other constellations and i noticed that the star-like objects that i saw a couple minutes earlier look more like discs rather then just bright stars. what happened in the next couple minutes changed all of that when both objects shot across the

to fall asleep, my son noticed a flash of light outside our window.  i got up to look outside and saw the beginnings of a lightning storm.  as i stood watching the lightning for a moment i noticed a cloud that seemed out of place.  if you have ever watched the sky during a rainstorm you may have noticed how some clouds start ‘streaming’ downward with the rain, forming vertical, striated curtains in the air.  this cloud was like that, about a block away, only it seemed much more dense than the usual and looked to be about ½ a block wide and was so low that it nearly touched the ground!  what made this really odd was that this lightning storm was completely dry…not so much as a drop of rain the entire evening!  then i noticed a ‘search light’.  at first i couldn’t figure out why it seemed so out of place, and then i realized it was upside down! the light was originating from the clouds and playing about the sky and onto the ground.  it was then that i was further distracted by a ‘form’ some way off, moving in the sky!  it was south of my apartment and about ¼ a mile away.  from that distance it looked like a flock of small birds moving through the air (at least the shape reminded me of a flock of birds, but it really didn’t move like one).  the overall outline was like that of an amoeba, constantly changing and made up of many tiny individual ‘parts’, and it moved and twisted and turned as a whole, flowing into different shapes!  (once later that evening i saw one divide itself into two separate ‘forms’ that moved off in different directions).  suddenly the ‘form’ that i was watching began to move north very quickly, towards our apartment building (we live in the corner apt. on the 3rd floor in a low rise just outside of slc, utah).  it passed out of sight from start to finish so quickly that i knew i wasn’t seeing something ‘normal’!  i excitedly asked my wife to get out of bed and put in her contacts so she could join me at the window and see what i was seeing!  the whole time she was in the master bathroom, i was giving her a ‘play by play’ of everything i witnessed!   we continued staring at the sky together, hoping to catch a glimpse of the strange ‘form’ again.  the weird cloud formation was still there and not moving with the other clouds; it just sat there stationary for the longest time before suddenly starting in motion towards the east (the other clouds were moving in a nw direction)and then dissipated very quickly!  we looked for the search lights again and this time found where we believed they originated from…a ufo!  it was hovering about a ½ mile away south of us and slightly west.  it sat in a clear section of the sky and we could see blue and red lights.  it was clearly visible yet it would occasionally ‘disappear’ only to reappear immediately, either in the same spot or only a short distance away from where it had vanished!  after watching it for some time, we determined that it may have been observing the same ‘form’ that i had seen a moment before.  it was then, only a short while later, that we saw another ‘form’ move into view, followed by even more until there were approximately 7-10 of them maneuvering across the sky (over the course of the evening we estimate we saw between 40-70 of these).  they seemed to be moving at random, up and down, making big sweeping arcs and sometimes speeding off out of sight!  as the storm slowly moved to the nw, so did the ‘forms’.  they were getting closer and closer to our vantage point, and now we could clearly see they weren’t birds (now i was contemplating that maybe they were insects…albeit, glittering ones!).  it was then that one of the ‘forms’ moved in much lower and closer to our building and swooped past us just above our window (only about 20 feet away)!  we now saw clearly that these weren’t a group of insects either, but rather small shining orbs of light/energy!  we couldn’t believe what we were seeing!  i was feeling both uncertainty and awe at the same time!   then we noticed some of the ‘beings’ (as we now felt certain we should be calling them) would move either behind or through a cloud and would start glowing!  you could follow their trajectory easily by watching their glow move about.  i also figured out finally what their movement reminded me of…a school of fish!  they were undulating in precision with each other…a giant mass of ‘life’ moving as one through the sky!  my heart was beating so fast at this point i thought i was destined to remain wide awake for hours!  at this time, we noticed the ufo once again.  it suddenly ‘blinked out’ and immediately reappeared about two miles further nw!  we could just make out a light emanating from it into the nearby clouds and sky.  my head was swimming with everything that was going on.  my wife and i (and our 3 year old who had joined us earlier) decided to move into our living room where our west facing window afforded us a better view of the slowly moving ‘procession’.  we never once thought to grab our phones and record the incident!  it was all so surreal and even seemed a little ‘sacred’ to us at the time.  once more we saw the ufo off in the distance blink out of sight again, and reappear in an instant, this time about 5-10 miles further nw!  it was a truly remarkable experience for us that night!  in the days that followed i did a lot of research into the phenomenon and found very little information on these ‘entities’.  what little i did find however, proved to be quite enlightening!  in the writings of dr. trevor james constable, he describes a life form fitting every detail we had observed (he also describes many more life forms we didn’t see…).  he had found that these ‘critters’ (as he called them) seemed to be attracted to the energy in lightning storms and would often appear as a result of their interaction with it!  he also described how they seemed to move like fish in the sky.  he also experimented with a device based on the designs of a wilhelm reich, that was purported to be capable of creating/altering weather in the sky and could be used to initiate ‘contact’ or attract these life forms to the area.  i don’t know if the strange cloud i saw is related to this, but it did seem quite a coincidence to see two topics of interest to constable, in the same event from our window.  i also came across a report on mufon (case# 56393) in which a gentleman from ogden, utah had described a flying object that looked almost exactly the same as the ‘beings’ my wife and i had witnessed! upon watching the entire video he had captured, we were positive that it was the same phenomena! i am hoping to interact with others who may have witnessed a similar ‘event’ so that we could gain more insight into these wonderful ‘beings’ in our sky; and maybe even the ufo too!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

instal a light it the middle of the woods .She said they didnt this thing was massive as soon as she said that it started to decend at first it was just hovering there we were the only car on the road as i approached the stop sighn my sister was hanging out of the window looking at it i had a clear view it had multiple levels massive  . i ran the stop sighn and turned on oldbrownsvill road to the left and it was decending parallel to the right of me all three of us had a clear view of it. as i was driving it was decending gradualy untill it landed in an open field but as it landed it blended in with all the city lights in the backgroung had we not seen it land nobody would have noticed it , i asked my sister whear did it go and she said its still there and it was . this thing was at least three to four stories tall with big huge round windows that gave off an orange light but didnt emitt light and in between the window it was an opague black this thing was only about 60 -80 feet away but with its size it felt like it was closer . it had three big round circles in the center part of it and on the top and lower levels it had 30-40 smaller lights that were orange and white .  this thing looked fake,like it shouldnt even be able to fly. this sounds dumb but it looked almost like a chineese lantern the kind they put candles in .Well i continued to drive to my house which was about 30 sec away and turned in my driveway going about 30 mph and threw the car in park opened the door and jumped out while yhe car still slid and jumped on my dirtbike and headed for the field in which it landed when i got to the fence and shined the headlight of the bike in that direction it was gone. but the crazy part of it is that field it landed in belongs to the corpus christi airport there is nothing back there but flat land and a clear view of the airport tower which was facing this things direction how could they not see this thing by its size it could have been seen by miles and with those huge massive orange lights .Thear radar should have picked this thing up flying in thear airspace.Ive lived behind this airport my whole life and seen all i mean all type of aircrafts leave and land but nothing like this. the only reason i am submitting this is because i havent been able to find a single picture on the internet that resembles what i saw that night and believe me

got closer to the next exit that when i realized that this object wasn't a blimp at all. it was at a stand still hover over what i knew at the time to be the landfill area which while growing up we used to go sledding down these man-made hills every winter. as i got closer the radio station that i was listening to went to static. i pulled over before the underpass and got out of my car to see what this thing was and as i got closer i saw that this was a disc shape and a little thinner then a blimp. before i could get my entire body out of the car it started ascending and all i could hear was a slight humming sound, in one quick motion the object moved up and to the right and then it took off in a flash, it almost looked like a comet streaked across the front of me and it was gone. after this incident no one was allowed to go sledding or even get close to the landfill site anymore, they put fences around the entire perimeter and there's ventilation shafts coming out of the

when i noticed a glowing orange orb above the trees south of my location.  the sky was crystal clear and the temperature was milder than usual for this time of year.  the orb seemed stationary and was larger than the north star in the sky.  i noticed it was moving slowly across the sky to the east at approximately 45 degrees.  i ran inside and told the other three people in the house with me to come and see what i was looking at.  we were all dumbfounded by what we saw.  after a couple of minutes a second orb appeared to the west at approximately the same altitude and distance, but maybe a mile away from the first orb.  the second orb was identical to the first, but moving a little quicker across the sky.  as the second orb moved across to the east, the first orb vanished as it seemed accelerate out of the atmosphere into space.  it got smaller and smaller at an even rate until it ultimately disappeared within seconds of its ascent.  the second orb also ascended very much like the first.  as we noticed the second disappear, my father in law ran in and grabbed a pair of high powered binoculars as a third orb appeared in the sky.  the third orb seemed to be a little bit lower in the sky than the first two and bit closer as well.  it hovered for a few minutes in the distance at approximately 35 degrees in the sky and also moved across to the east for a few minutes before exiting out of the atmosphere like the first two.  we each observed the third orb through the binoculars and what we saw was incredible.  it seemed to be a soft glowing orange sphere that had a somewhat darker flat bottom side.  also, it seemed to fan out around the top.  the light was not bright like a fire, or like the sun, instead it was soft and easy to look at even though it seemed incredibly bright in the sky.  i would guess each object was similar in size and most likely judging by the distance away in the sky, they would have been equivalent to the size of a commercial airplane.  the videos were shot with an iphone without a zoom and it was quite dark since we are out in cottage country, but the image is quite clear in each video.  after the incident i called the non emergency police line and filed a report.  there were no other witnesses that called this event in at the time i filed the report.","distance":"Over One

light above the neighbor's security light. i stepped outside and realized that it wasn't making any sound and was staying in one place. i had, at first,thought it was a helicopter because it was maintaining the same position. i was very excited and not scared at all. looking back it seems strange that i wasn't frightened at all. i went to get my parents but it was as if they didn't hear me. i got binoculars, stepped back outside and looked towards the object. just as i started to focus the binoculars the object shot off to the south at an extremely fast rate then simply vanished. as far back as i can remember, i've heard unusual sounds at night and was terrified of one corner in my room. i had this feeling of terror and believed that some creature came out of that corner at night. this was the beginning of sightings and visitations that first i, and then my daughter experienced. we both came to believe, separately, that these visits have to do with my grandson, who is also her son. he is extremely intelligent. i have had several sightings. the last one occurred outside my grandson's bedroom window when he was 8 or 9. my daughter has had recurring visits from what is usually called the greys. we feel as if they are watching over us. we feel that they are protecting us and monitoring our family. we don't want a lot of people to know about this because we don't want my

looking for scorpions with new backlight flashlights, when i noticed a large ring of light hovering over a rock mesa by our house. i initially thought it was a light someone was testing for a 4th of july show. we continued to search for scorpions in our side yard, and were about to go in when the light got brighter. (at least it appeared that way) as i looked i noticed there was no light shining up to the sky, and the ring of light was above the clouds. as my daughter and i stared at the light we both got light headed and she got a bit queasy. i had a green laser light in my truck, parked in the driveway along with a bright night light, spotlight. (charger plug in type) i took the laser light and shined it on the circle. nothing, it stayed where it was. i then got my daughter and we drove to the base of the mesa, and found nobody or homes with any lights shining up. we were now almost directly under the edge of the circle. my daughter got frightened, and i was just a little uneasy, but my curiosity over rode it. i pulled back into the driveway and took out my \"surefire\" flashlight and shined it directly into the center of the circle, thinking it would do nothing. almost instantly two smaller circles of light shot out of the edge of the ring, one going north, and the other going south. they both went incredibly fast and both at the same time and speed. a few seconds later they returned and stopped the instant they touched the ring. i will admit i don't scare easy, but that got me a bit. the light had to be above the clouds as it stayed the perfect disk as it left, and on approach. despite my daughters telling me not to and my inner voice telling me not to, i took out my sunbeam spotlight and pointed it in the circle's center and turned it on. in a matter of seconds, the circle intensified in brilliance, and suddenly turned into several of the disk like orbs of light and flew at an enormous rate of speed from where the ring of light was directly over our heads to the east until we could no longer see them. they were full out of sight in a matter of seconds. they flew with no sound. we live in a black out neighborhood. (no streetlights) and in a retirement community. there are only a few of us here year around and not many on a cloudy rainy weekend. i wasn't going to say anything except for the fact that while walking my dog last week i noticed a flashing white, yellow bluish, red object hovering way above where i saw the ring. while i was looking at it, it faded to just a dull yellowish white, then faded away. disappeared if you will. i've never seen anything like it. i was the only one to see the last one, that i know of, except my dog, but last i know she won't say a word. (a little levity) \r\nkind of has me on edge. i've never had an experience like that, and thought for sure someone had to be playing with lights. searched hi and low, but, well, nothing. not a stitch of anything.\r\n i would like to see it again, and have looked several times during clouds and clear weather,but nothing so far. i'm a bit uneasy as well, because sometimes you find what your looking for and once that happens, you can \"unfind\" it. on a scale of 1 - 10 i had a 6 in the uneasy factor. i told ny daughter not to discuss it with her friends unless they brought something up first, but that at least she has an experience in her memory to hold on to. she has complained of a number of bad dreams since the night of july 3rd.    thank you for letting me tell my story.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":60220,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.79815432708922,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09302014-0010","longitude":-111.7779949155325,"occurred":1404451800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1412075550000,"summary":"Large light circle above clouds, two small disk like circles flew off, at incredible speed, the the circle turned into 8 -10 smaller disks and flew east over head.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"86351","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":88,"locationName":"Sedona, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:97435"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Eugene","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in my back yard laying in my chair listening to my head phones smoking. i was star gazing. im not one to talk like this, but it was late and i noticed a jet tail i thought from the east, the thing was it was only a piece of one. i literally was only out there for half my song when out of nowhere, literally a formation appeared right out of thin air it was like a geese formation. at first i couldn't believe my eyes. iv never seen anything like it. i started screaming at my friend to look at it. she was on the phone and came out and she seen it to. shes in denial she says they were ducks. ducks do not glow. it kept disappearing then reappeared a little further away. i think i was in shock i didn't feel scared. all i could do is stand out there in disbelief. i always thought people were off there rockers hearing about ufo encounters, that is until tonight. it scares me to think something so big and out of place is going un noticed. it makes me question life?
