(like the kind that is attached to an object like a fence and allowed to spin from the propulsion of the gun powder/sparks)\r\n\r\ndue to a previous encounter during my lifetime i often observe the night sky. for this reason, and as mentioned i recently noticed the reoccurring lights (the aforementioned objects) and it has become a pass time of mine to look at the horizon late at night to see if the objects are observable. on the night of this sighting there were four other witnesses. i was checking the sky the night the spiral was seen, and several house guests along with two other family members witnessed the object which i had identified in the night sky to the northwest of our location. from our viewpoint the object pulsated with red and blue lights and was observed for several minutes when two aircraft approached the object's location from the north and east...Moving right to left across the sky above the silhouette of the ridge-line of the surrounding mountains. (these craft were assumed to be usaf fighter jets from malmstrom afb in great falls, mt and the planes came specifically from the location of the base; north and east ) when the planes got close (distance unknown) to the object it emitted a spiraling pinwheel of sparking lights and instantaneously shot straight up in the air. none of the witnesses seem to be able to recall where the airplanes went after the object departed because we were were all enthralled about witnessing the spiral.  \r\n\r\nthis is the second direct close ufo observation of my lifetime. my first encounter occurred as a child while traveling on a very isolated western montana highway in the early 1970's. during that encounter, a craft traveled over my family's car and a brilliant white light (like none i have ever seen since) lit up our vehicle and and much of the surrounding forrest. (like daylight and it was late in the evening) two of my family members directly witnessed the craft that evening as they gazed upward out of the window of the car in which we were traveling. this sighting was witnessed in the early 1970's, i believe 1973, and was well documented at the time in the region as being seen by many throughout the state of montana. the craft in that incident was described as very large cigar shaped and traveling from west to east.     \r\n\r\n\r\n           ","distance":"Over One

very high up (satellite height) but still appeared about the size of a basketball. i immediately pointed it out to my roommate who witnessed the entire event with me.\r\n\r\nthe object looked sort of like an egg in a frying pan, yellowish oval with a dark center spot.  it flew from horizon to horizon in approximately 1 to 2 minutes.  as it approached the west horizon, it started to zig zag sharply while still heading in the same direction and then paused briefly, then continued in a straight flight pattern. it looked as if it flew past the earth, not orbiting the earth.  about 30 seconds later, an exact duplicate flew over but was a bit smaller, looking like it had more altitude.  the second object flew straight, from and to the same direction, but this one did not pause or hesitate.  they both were flying at a very fast rate of speed, as i have seen satellites orbiting the earth when doing night fishing on minnesota lakes, these were definitely not satellites, or high flying

yelled look out the window. i did but didn't see anything right away. then i saw it .A star looking object. it would just free fall then stay stationary for 5 mins at a time or so. it would move to the right of the tree  hover then back to the left very fast. it went back to the right again. i went outside in the woods road next to ck pt to observe it. it was moving in a  wavy like pattern. i saw colored lights and pulsating lights.At that point my friend was concerned it would come where we were and wanted me to come back inside. i scooted it back inside and noticed it was behind a big tree lights still visible. must of watched it another 5-10 mins it just hovered in one spot. then it was gone in a flash.At one point i saw a jet way high in the sky overhead. this object was not a helicopter, plane space station balloon. its movement was definitely nothing of this earth.This encounter lasted a good 25 mins or so.I'm sure of the time because we were just shutting down ck point for the night.When i first noticed it i thought it was a planet.I was in awe when i realized this thing moved like nothing ive ever seen in the northern sky. i became curious and went outside to really see what it was. i became apprehensive because my friend was afraid i could be abducted as has happened in the area awhile back.We shut down  the ck pt lights and all. shut the shades and peeked out through them.The object just left in thin air.I always thought humans an arrogant species thinking there is no alien life but this experience definitely showed me we are not alone. i am thrilled to have experienced this up close. we had i phone but only thought of it after incident.We spoke of our experience and were ridiculed by some and others in the area spoke about their own experiences in sighting ufos i guess we live in an active area for them. people don't report because they don't want to be ridiculed or accept ufos as a given.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

of my camp chairs out with me as i often did. my dog began her tour of the yard looking for just the right place to do her evening duty. i set the chair facing east, sat down and began to scan the eastern and overhead sky. it was very pleasant out, clear with a slight chill in the air. i saw a few satellites travel in their usual short track then fade out as they lost light from the sun set over the western horizon. a few commercial aircraft went over and begin their turn toward seatac just south of seattle. \r\n\r\ni looked straight up over me. there was a white light traveling end to end along toward the east. it reminded me of a fluorescent lamp tube shining brightly. one end of the tube flew along as if was the bow, the other end follow along as would the stern. i watched it travel with no alteration at all in its path. for about six seconds there was nothing to block my view. as it traveled along in that time, it seemed to slow and drop down toward the horizon. at six or seven seconds it was behind the tips of the fir trees, perhaps 15 to 20 degrees above horizon, beyond my back yard drifting straight line down toward the heavier burdened limbs of the trees, and it was gone. in relative shape, it would resemble, length and width, as if it were an old fashion wooden one foot school ruler about three to four times as long as the commercial jets i frequently viewed.\r\n\r\nthe apparent slowing made sense to me if the object had been very high. i listened for sounds of propulsion; there was only silence. i thought there would be a sonic boom; there was no boom. the object must have been very high indeed, high enough to be above the atmosphere. that made the idea that the apparent slowing was due to the higher arc it traveled. as it traveled above me and beyond, its rate of travel was steady.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

local airport and see planes all the time. this moved very differently to planes. it moved from right to left very slowly. at this point i thought may be a helicopter. then it moved upwards a short distance , hovered then fell to earth rapidly. no noise. the lights where very bright green/blue and red. i couldn't say how far away it was but seemed fairly close. the whole thing lasted around 20 seconds in my scope of view as it descended by nearby buildings and lost sight of it. it was certainly not something i have seen before.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
