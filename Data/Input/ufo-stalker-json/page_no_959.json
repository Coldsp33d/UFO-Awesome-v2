\r\n\r\n     i live out in the country near terrell, tx.  i took the dogs outside to do their business.  i was standing in the driveway and was looking at the night sky.  i noticed one particular star in the northeastern sky which was white, but then a flash of red and then blue could be seen.  i stared at this star for a while, and then i saw it move.  so i kept watching it to see if it was an airplane, or something.  it moved to the right, then quickly to the left.  it did this a few times, then it ascended a little higher, and then dropped down to its original position.  it just kept hovering.  \r\n     i thought, \"what is going on?  what is that?\"  \r\npersonally, i do not believe that little green men are visiting planet earth, but i do feel that the government is keeping secrets from us.  \r\n\r\nback to the story:  \r\n     the object appeared to be too far away to get a picture or video.  aside from that, i have no video capabilities or camera.  i live in the country, so it is dark, except for farm lights.  the object's distance from me is unknown, so i cannot calculate the nearest city or county.  i can only furnish my own city and county from my viewpoint.     \r\n     after observing it for awhile i took the dogs inside and finished watching television with my wife.  \r\n     around 10:20 pm. that same evening i took the dogs out for their final time for the night.  i noticed that the object was still there in the same place.  i went into the house and said to my wife, \"come outside with me.  i want to show you something.\"  we went outside and i said, \"look at that star.  let me know if you see it move.  i don't know if i'm seeing things or if its really moving?\"  we both stood there, and then it happened again.  it started moving like i described above.  she saw it move too.  we didn't stay outside very long.  she was tired and had to get up early in the morning to go to work.  we went into the house and went to bed.  \r\n     personally,  i feel that the government has built some sort of aircraft with new technology and someone was test flying it.  i am curious, and don't know how much longer these test flights will be going on.  if this presents some interest, quick response is probably needed because this has been occurring for several nights in a row now.  the latest was last night. each night it does the same thing.  it was not just a one night occurrence.  this is why i believe they are doing tests with the aircraft.  i do have details for the nights of sept. 25, 26, & 28.  i really would like to know what this thing is.  with your time, experience and equipment, i feel, this incident can be solved.     \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

to the corner of my house to keep watching it go. i witnessed it basically from horizon to horizon which it covered in under 30 seconds.  as it was beginning to get farther away i noticed it sorta wobbled side to side a little, kinda like a plane would hit turbulence and maybe veer off course slightly then regain the path.  now just fyi, im directly in the flight path of philly int airport and its common to see planes fly over every 45 seconds to a minute or so apart on various approaches or flying in other directions such as newark.  i know this was not a plane.  it was a solid bright

i assume it was the occupants moving around.The craft appeared to be at least 100'+ wide and 25' or so high. it was a dark dull grey/black metallic craft with lights on the bottom only. i saw no navigation lights. the bottom lights were an amber and a red/orange color of varying sizes but the odd thing was that there was no beam coming from any of the lights - they simply glowed. the size of the lights was from streetlight size to perhaps 24\" in diameter. there was a low hum coming from the object which i only noticed on close approach at about 50'. i slowed down to a near stop when the object moved close to the highway and then spun around like a top and reversed direction. as it did so, i heard a loud static noise come from my radio for approximately 15 seconds. i did not call this in to report it because i wasn't sure what i was looking at and did not want to put my job in jeopardy in case it was a real ufo. the object then moved away slowly to the east until i could no longer see it. i realized that my vehicle was stopped on the highway although i remember thinking that i did not intend to stop. i looked at the clock and realized that i had been watching the object for 15 minutes. at that point, i saw a jet moving very fast from east to west, it banked to the north and went back east. it looked like a fighter jet that may have been looking for the object i saw. i could hear it clearly. i did not believe in ufos before this incident but i know what i saw and it was not something of ours - at least that is known to the public.

ufos that we'd studied about before.\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\n- these were the infamous \"balloon-like\" clusters, as well as some single spheres that seemed to slowly move in paths. the 1st group had 3 separate sphere clusters, the 2nd group had 2 separate sphere clusters. some groups had a red sphere within a cluster of apparently white spheres.

out any form other than a round glowing orb. after i dismissed it as being airplanes i thought it might be a few meteors but no contrails were visible. i ran into my house to the front door so i could follow it going past my house and watched it for about 10 seconds until they disappeared in a flutter well before an airplane would have faded out. i saw two airplanes in the area north of me who must
