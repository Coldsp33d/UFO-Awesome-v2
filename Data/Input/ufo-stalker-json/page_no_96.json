field investigator l. flechtner 18809 on november 21, 2017\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nit was 6:14. a clear night and i was outside relaxing and looking at aircraft when i noticed some small red lights, they appeared to belong to aircraft landing nearby. while i was watching the planes i saw a white fluorescent luminous boomerang fly across the sky.\r\nit was as if a searchlight had illuminated that part of the sky in a boomerang shape. it was fast, about 10000 mph. i saw the underbelly of the craft which was fluorescent glowing white with three little bright lights on the wing tips and other lights on the wings and other parts of the body of the craft. it appeared to be a lot larger than the commercial aircraft and flying a lot lower. the sighting lasted about 2 seconds. \r\notis air force base is near by, but i know that wasn't a military craft.\r\ni can sketch a drawing of what i saw.\r\n\r\nanother sighting i had was at the same location in the last two weeks of december of 2013. once again was outside relaxing, it was about 8 or 9 pm. i saw a bright light in the sky. it went from white to all the colors of the rainbow as it streaked across the sky. this lasted for 10 to 15 seconds. it has a straight line path.  it just tapered off and disappeared.\r\n  \r\na week later i was outside in 6\" of snow about 50' from the house at about 11:45 pm. i was adjusting a thermostat in the back yard, as i turned to go in the house i saw a smokey black triangle in the sky. it was a clear night so i could see the outline of the craft very clearly. it was in the east at about 5 miles away. it seemed to have a field of energy around it, i felt the hair on my arms move.","distance":"Over One

were.  at one point they moved northeast on a steady path eastward. i went inside for a few minutes, then came back with phone in case they returned.  they had so i took a short video.  you can observe the hovering lights above the nearby lit homes.  i also attached a picture depicting similar craft that someone else observed a while back.  pets did not react, i did not feel anything other than intrigued.  \r\n\r\nwas thinking police or military drone (nearby bases)  after initial siting a helicopter flew by fairly low.  there was also a plane in the vicinity during this time.  both of those are not unusual events, just the timing during the sighting period.\r\n\r\nhaving trouble uploading video.  only shows lights in distance hovering for a few, not very clear.  see pic attached

turned south and upward then suddenly vanished. this took place all within 20 - 30 seconds. from my patio jet liners seem approximately the size of a dime but this thing appeared to be farther away
