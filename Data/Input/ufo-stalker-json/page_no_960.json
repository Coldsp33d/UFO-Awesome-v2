disappeared. the sky was clear and there was no moon that i remember. i could make out an oval to round shape that was completely black with the light close to the middle. the light continued from east to west and disappeared behind some trees. there was absolutely no sound at all but a very slight whisper of wind on my head. the object appeared to be gliding and was not traveling very fast

description i can put forth: immediately following the shooting star, there was a dark object that seemed to rotate 180 degrees, but as it was rotating, the side that was coming into visibility, was an bright white/orange orb that suddenly shot into hyper space like a star wars ship. this object made absolutely no noise. the first thought that came into my head was, \"there was somebody/something

we could see lots of white lights moving around.  i replied to my father looks like theres people around checking things.As we drew nearer the lights appeared to raise up from behind the trees but bow white and blue flashing.My father kept asking what do you think it is?I said its an aeroplane just took off but my father saw an entirely different object to what  i thought which i questioned.I said what do you see...He replied it,s like something out of flash gordon look at the lights all over it!We approached a bend in the road and the object moved outward toward sea while passing over the trees at roughly 5 to 10 mph....My father said it looks like its stopping or going to land on the main road.As we neared the main road which is beside a local land mark called st.Marys lighthouse we turned and saw to our disbelief what i saw was an aeroplane hovering above the houses but what was strange it seemed to have landed.I was driving very slow lookin up at the craft and wanted to stop but my father said whatever you do dont stop theres something weird going on.I remember a car passing us but not making a sound or stopping or even where it  had gone.Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion.Alll around there was silence and nobody around.I  passed below the craft and saw wht appeared to be a doorway with stairs leading from it..My father said keep going dont stop as i nearly mounted a kerb.The craft had blue and white lightes on its wings which were flashing in sequence ,they were very bright and seemed to be signaling out to sea.As we were driving away i said to my dad i wander what this woman is doing walking down the middle of the road.Also do you realise theres no one around or any sign of life.The figure approaching appeared to be a woman but like a dark sillohette.We kept on driving not looking back or noticing where she had gone....We got home explaining what we had just seen to family members and our thoughts and asked if anything had beeen on news but there was nothing nothing on radio as far as i know. my father still says he saw something completely different to what i thought which is very strange on my behalf and to which neither of has any explanation.There is one thing to add and that is i saw the same thing again but at a different time with another person.This event took place at exactly the same location in broad day

helicopter not too far distant. this was in brazil, indiana, about midway between indianapolis and terre haute. a search light also appeared to be on. no other light, which is no surprise due to the glare of the bright white front light which seemed to be directed to the highway. getting closer, out of direct line of the white light, i finally saw green light on one side. assuming the white light was in front, that would be the correct position for green light on aircraft. this, however, had 5 green lights along the side. i know of no u.S. aircraft with more position lights than one green on the right and one red on the left of the craft. driving in traffic with the windows up--it was getting cool--it was impossible to listen for sound.\r\n\r\nthis area is no stranger to either civilian or military aircraft. it was the multiple green lights on the side that seemed strange to me. never saw that before.\r\n\r\napproximate location of object: 39.529417, -87.098763 (supplied by google
