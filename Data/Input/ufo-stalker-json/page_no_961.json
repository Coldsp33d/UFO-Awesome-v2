we were near the west middlesex high school . there was the homecoming game happening at the time. the football field was sort of behind the school on the right side.I just happened to be glancing up looking at the stars and noticed it.It was a glowing round ball of orange yellow pink light.It wasn't casting any light from it. it just glowed. we saw the object on the left side of the road right above t. bruce campbell construction. i thought initially it was a streetlight/spotlight. it looked just like the light on a street lamp but appeared to be too high. it didn't move. we got closer and i rolled down the window. it didn't make any noise. it seemed to be slowly moving higher and more south west. i turned left onto carbaugh st. and pulled into the parking lot of regenex/ shenango steel. it sat above this building but higher in the sky now. i thought it was moving southwest so i got back on rt 18 heading south and couldn't see it. i turned around in a parking lot headed back north and thought it was gone. it may have been too far at this point.\r\nthere were people around coming and going from the game. it is possible that someone else may have witnessed it as well. about 20 minutes before this happened there had been fireworks above the football field. it seemed too large and too bright to be a remnant of fireworks. it was a pretty good distance from the football field.\r\nwhen i just got on your site i saw the ball of light from alaska that was posted. it looked exactly like that. i thought someone in my area sent a pic in of the ball of light that i

light just south of the highest point in the sky (so just below 90 degrees from the ground).  then all of a sudden the object began to move to the north.  then it stopped.  then it moved to the south, but not in a straight line.  then over a period of approximately five minutes the light moved in all different directions (sometimes n or nw or ne or s or sw or se or w or e) in no apparent pattern.  sometimes it moved in a straight line and sometimes it seemed to be swerving as it moved.  when it moved, sometimes it would move for five to seven seconds.  other times when it moved, it would only move for a second or two.  there seemed to be no pattern to this either.  in other words, of the many times it moved n sometimes it traveled for many seconds and other times when it moved north it would only do so for a second.  the light would remain stationary sometimes.  when it was stationary, it seemed to flash four white lights (two on each side - one set of lights was on the west side of the light and the other side of lights was on the east side of the light).  i have seen many objects in the sky.  my children and i like to look at the stars.  i have seen jets, proper-driven planes, helicopters, blimps, and satelites in the sky.  they usually move in a straight line.  if they turn, they do so gradually.  this light moved back and forth at what must have been a fantastic speed.  when i first saw it move i thought it was a satelite because it was at such a high elevation.  i was not under the influence of alcohol nor drugs when this occurred.  i am not mentally ill.  i am a police officer (if that matters).  i am going back outside right now to see if i can keep watching it.  if i had a video camera with me i would record it.  i have never seen anything like this in my life, and like i mentioned i have spent a lot of time (at an amateur level) looking up at the stars.  i have spent many nights camping and fishing and have spent hundreds of hours stargazing.  i don't know what this thing was.  in fact, it frightens me because i didn't think aircraft could perform in ways i just observed.  probably the most unsetteling thing was the way the light sometimes \"swerved\" when it moved.  it's hard to describe, but it was almost like it was shaking as it moved sometimes. but at other times it didn't appear to shake when it moved.  i didn't see it swerve nor shake when it remained stationary.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with

and attempt to take a picture with my phone. i drove to the west side of the parking lot and remained inside my vehicle due to fear/apprehension. i managed to get one distant blurry picture of this single object before noticing *two more* objects of exactly the same size and light description as above moving behind it in a line from the same direction (at this point i was really scared and confused!). even though i was shaken and upset - not only because of the strange orange color but because of how low they seemed to be in relation to the treeline! - i managed to get two pictures of these images, one farther away, and one with full zoom. the second picture is not steady, hence the slight blur above the lights. the orange glow isn't hardly visible at all in the pictures and looks nothing like the lights appeared in person! it was a very distinct orange-red glow. \r\n\r\ni left after i took the third picture out of fear and anxiety. once i arrived home to gladstone, i observed

what i was seeing.  it proceeded northbound for perhaps three seconds, then made a similar right turn to the east.  it then made a similar turn to the south.  one more right turn, and it was once again headed westbound.  the trajectory was straight west, but the aircraft diminished in size rapidly, indicating to me that it was gaining altitude quickly.  it was gone from sight three seconds after it’s last right turn.  two things are for sure:   what i saw was an object.   the object i saw performed maneuvers that no known modern aircraft should be able to perform.\r\ni feel compelled to

this i simply assumed the dim lit lights were that of the windows of a passenger airplane. at this point i couldn't see its shape, just the lights. after about 20 to 30 minutes of glancing at what i assumed were window lights, i realized this \"plane\" was not moving nor was it making any sound and realized it was not a plane. i stood up in the bed of the truck and told those with me to look. i began pointing at it because they couldn't see it. its windows were too dim. when i began pointing and loudly saying \"look! look! it's there\" it began moving toward us. it was a very dark object, but the closer it moved the better i could see its shape. it looked as if it had a wide, huge bell on top of it. when i saw it almost over our truck, my mother and stepbrother still couldn't see it. a lady in a car next to use began trying to see it. it moved upward, tilted and that is when i saw the brighter lights on the bottom of this object. i was almost screaming for them to see it! at that moment it began moving, wobbling, and began going upward with its shape changing into a typical saucer shape. my stepbrother saw it at this point and said, \"i see it! look!\" at that time it began flopping from one side to the other several times. with each flop it got smaller like it was moving away. we were both tying to get my mother to see it, and she did at the point just before it went

flashing different colored lights red, blue, white, orange, but stationary, the flashing was erratic. some of these objects were all in one area, in what looked to be almost a triangular shape with a few surrounding ones, and a couple were dispersed in other areas of the sky. some of the objects, lights, started moving, when they moved the flashing lights became intensified, they almost looked like they were swirling around, and you could almost make out what looked like a disc like shape the lights flashed in a line. they moved very fast and erratic and seemed to disappear but, it may have been cause they were so fast moving because i would notice them in a whole new area in the sky way further away, where they would stay and hover and look like flashing star like objects again. this week i have seen these star like lights, everyday, they seem star like but clearly are not, although they have never moved like they did tonight.","distance":"Over One

light that looked like an airplane, except that it was traveling much faster, like a satellite. it looked as though it were heading towards lansing capital airport, but the \"plane\" was too high in the sky, and traveling too quickly. also, the \"plane\" did not have flashing red or green lights.\r\n\r\nthen i noticed the object turned 90° very quickly, and shortly thereafter came to a complete stop, hovering in the sky. then the light descended a great distance and then continued to hover. the object then slowly panned left, and then slowly panned right, and then it ascended very quickly back to its original altitude. the object panned back-and-forth a couple more times, and then disappeared.\r\n\r\ni happened to look away for a minute when the object disappeared, so i don't know what direction it traveled, or if it just \"winked out.\" when the object was still in the sky, i tried videotaping what i saw, but it was too dark to record with my iphone. i used binoculars to get a closer look, but all i could see was a bright light, as though you were looking at a planet using binoculars. there may have been a sound emitted by the object, but i couldn't tell. i believe it was completely silent, or i was too far away to hear it. \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then
