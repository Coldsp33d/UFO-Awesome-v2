(he on our back balcony and i in the bedroom) when all of a sudden he started shouting for me to come out and look at something in the sky just above our apartment building (we live on the 2nd level of a two story bldg).\r\n\r\nonce i rushed out on the balcony, we observed three orbs of light in a triangular shape move sideways across the sky. he asked me what i thought it was, and i immediately asked him what he thought it was, in which, he response was, \"you know what it is.\" \r\n\r\ni stood on the balcony looking up at these three orbs crossing the sky kind of side ways and trying to rule out an airplane, helicopter, and such. well we live in direct path of descending planes so i knew that wasn't it and we're high enough to distinguish helicopters, so that wasn't it either.\r\n\r\njust as i had almost given up on trying to figure out what they were, the lights stopped in mid-air still maintaining a triangular shape, hovered for a few minutes, then one of the lights moved and started like dancing around one of the other orbs of light. this movable orb of light did not blink but moved lightening fast dancing around one orb, so close that it looked like it had become one light. \r\n\r\nthen the dancing orb moved quickly back into position while the shape just hovered over our building, then quietly shimmered away in mid-air. these orbs of light didn't move off or anything. it just stood still and shimmered away.\r\n\r\ni was completely in shock & awe. my boyfriend tried to take video of this incident, but we couldn't get all of the orbs of light in one frame.\r\n\r\nalthough i have told a few people of what i saw, and with them looking at me like i was crazy, i have held on to this story (i do not take drugs or drink alcohol). however, with the increase of ufo tv shows coming on, i decided to tell my story on the day i saw a ufo.\r\n\r\ni know what i

cruising altitude in the ne sky. suddenly a fiery tail appeared that looked like an engine fire. \r\n\r\n(i was feeling very disturbed at this point as i thought i was witnessing an airplane crash.)\r\n\r\nthe object continued \"on fire\" at speed along a straight se trajectory.\r\n\r\n(i quickly called my wife to come outside and we watched together.)\r\n\r\nafter about 2 minutes, 3 objects split off from the original and started to curve down and away from the original object. these 3 objects all had fiery tails and looked the same as the original object and traveled at approximately the same speed.\r\n\r\n(at this point i started feeling nauseous with the thought of people dying in the airplane. the sight reminded me of the space shuttle that blew up on takeoff when the booster rockets shot off on their own.)\r\n\r\nthese 3 objects spiraled downward slowly around each other for several more minutes. they changed directions several times as they weaved around and down. the 3 objects intermittently lost their fiery tail and appeared as green lights. they seemed to be interacting with each other in a sense that as one would move in a direction, the others stayed near (see video).\r\n\r\n(at this time i knew it wasn't an airplane based on the flight pattern of these objects, and my thoughts changed to confusion.)\r\n\r\nwe watched them spiral downward until the sight line was blocked. the original object continued on its original trajectory and also had an intermittent fiery tail. i followed the original object until it was to dim to

and made a hard port turn, since my vessel was a very good maneuvering ship, and cleared by my starboard side the object. i ordered to my steerman on the bridge, to take the binoculars, to check what type of ship it was. he told me moments later that he only saw a black mass with red and yellow lights. i put the wheel on autopilot again, took another binoculars and saw the same thing. when it was on my side it made no noise at all, no engine sounds, no water sound as a ship sailing. it seem to be floating over the water very close to the surface. weather condition were good, almost no wind, cloudy and mild temperature, sea state very good.My steerman was very frightened whe he saw the object close to the vessel. the object passed to my stern very fast, moving away, and its lights fade

period i was able to observe it, and i wondered at its size, but realized that its size would depend on how far away it was  --  if it were 2 miles away, it would have been perhaps 100' in diameter, but if it were 200 miles distant, it would of necessity been significantly larger, for it to have appeared so plainly to me.\r\n\r\ni was concerned, being unable to accurately determine the size or speed of the object, and unable to determine if the object was orbital or would contact the earth  --  i never heard or felt anything, but the actions of the object were such that if it were to contact the earth within 10 miles, it would have\r\nmade a sound or shook the earth, so it is likely that the object was either orbital, or that it hit the earth far enough away so i would not have heard anything.\r\n\r\ndue to the proliferation of cameras, (traffic, security, etc) i would think that it should not be difficult to find a record of it on s facing cameras in the knoxville area.\r\n\r\nthe intensity and speed of the object did not change, nor were there contrails, sparks, or other\r\nindicators of its passing.\r\n\r\ni can think of no way the appearance could have been fabricated in order to perpetrate a prank.\r\n\r\ni am 82, retired, and reasonably active with no significant health issues, and have never before observed such an event.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

very close to my point of vision which immediately drew my attention.  the meteor was quick and glowed to approximately -3.5 magnitude.  as my eyes turned towards the meteor, i was able to see the final moment of the meteor as the glow died out.  almost immediately i noticed a dim object which seemed to just appear suddenly along the path the meteor took.  at this point the object was slightly north of due east and approximately midway between the horizon and my zenith.  the object began moving westward for about four seconds until it was almost straight up from me.  at this point, the object abruptly changed direction to due north and seemed to move three times as fast as it was previously moving.  when it moved north, it left what appeared to be a vapor trail as it moved north.  when the object made its northward direction change, it was approximately 10 degrees north of my zenith point.  it quickly moved north for a count of \"one\" when it began a turn towards the west which it maintained until it was heading due south.  the distance between the line along the northward movement and the southbound travel was approximately one degree.  i continued to follow the object until an apple tree behind me blocked my view of the object at which time i moved to an area with a unobstructed, but light polluted southern view.  i was unable to reacquire the object at that time.  the object itself appeared to be about two thirds the size of an aspirin when held at arm's length.  it was circular in shape and appeared to be separated into four section.  i could easily make out the dark area of the circle with a cross in the center with the arms of the cross extending to the outer circle.  both the circle and cross were the same dark color.  however, the areas between the arms of the cross appeared to glow a dull burnt orange color.  there was no deviation of the orange-like color in the four wedges.  the best comparable description of the object is it looked like one of those simon games where the yellow areas of the game were the dark color and the colored buttons of the game the burnt orange color.  i did not hear any sound coming from the object (when it first appeared, i was wearing earphones listening to music.  moments before it made its abrupt northward turn, i removed the ear buds).","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

(i say i call it a ufo, as it really was unidentified, it was hovering mid-air and i couldn't identify it). it was a normal evening, 7pm and i was putting my son to bed when i had this outer worldly, remarkable experience with something from another dimension. i'm not sure if it was et related or spirit related, but either way, it has turned my world upside down and inside out! i was reading my little 4yr old boy a bedtime story, we were in his room, he was on my knee as we sat on the bed as per usual.  suddenly i noticed a movement out of the corner of my eye, to the left of me. just about 16 inches/ 40 cms away from me, within arms reach was a hovering golden solid orange/yellow ball trying to catch my attention, i just froze and could not believe what i was seeing! it had just materialized out of nowhere. it was about the size of a tennis ball, i have seen orbs in photos but it was nothing like those, which are quite transparent), this was solid. i studied science & zoology at university so have a very inquisitive mind, so i was taking my opportunity to view it from a science perspective, it was 3 dimensional,and looked like it wanted me to communicate with it, (but during the whole experience my worry was for my son). i kept an eye on it while trying to remain calm as i didn't want to scare my son sitting on my knee. i just continued to tell the story to him and mumbled out words that didn't really make any sense and held the book up close to his face, wondering in my mind if i should ask him to look and see it too, but decided best not to. i could have tried to touch it, and maybe would have if i was alone without my son, i would have spoken to it to see what would happen. it knew i was looking at it, i was scared at the time and still am now. its hard to describe its movement, to me it looked like it was finding it hard to stay in one place, with jaggered kind of hover, (like a hover fly). it did move further around to my left until it was over my sons pillow, about 15cm above it. i held my son tight on my knee, while studying this strange object, and then after a minute it disappeared, either dematerialized or going through the bedroom wall itself! then it was gone. to this day i'm spending hours a day looking for answers. i know about orbs in photos etc, but this was solid? i always thought that there must have been other life out there in the universe somewhere, but i never did think ufos or ets were visiting/ or existing on earth but now i do. since i have personally experienced something from another dimension (whether it be some sort of et, or from the spirit realm, i'm now an avid true 'believer' and i'm now seeking the real truth. the after effects have been hard for me, as of coarse i don't want to sound like a nutter, but i also didn't want to keep this to myself. it took me afew weeks to get enough courage to tell my husband, and my son has nightmares and finds it hard to sleep, (i have not told him any of this, but i had a fear it could be related after i have heard about abductions etc...)at first i thought it was spirit related so visited a spiritual shop, when the woman behind the counter explained to me that some ets can first materialize as orbs and hang around homes), so that has lead me to mufon and writing this as i have seen 2 other strange things, i know this sounds truely absurd so i hate to even write this, but i had seen a light shoot out the carved top of my sons bed, and also a really big white light in the sky at night (12 months ago), near the house, but never seen it since. i feel like i had to explain this to help myself get it off my chest and reach out to others whom may have something similar. now i am constantly looking everywhere for evidence. its nice to have my eyes opened to the real world but at the time i feel abit frightened about whats really happening and now my faith in science, (which doesn't beleive in any of these matters), has been dislodged and shaken to the core!
