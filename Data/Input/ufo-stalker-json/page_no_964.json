was around 1.40 at night friday 14th of march 2014 when i heard a sound from outside of my flat. in the beginning i thought it was a car waiting with the engine turned on. after a while it started getting distant but not disappearing. i opened one window to see who it is but no car outside. it was a noise like a big vibrating roar. i thought it might be the central heating of the building but immediately i realized it was coming from the top of the next building. like it was hovering above it. then it started moving around, at that point i realized that something is not quite right. i couldn't see anything. the night was not a dark night, i could clearly distinguish the horizon over the hilltop nearby and the lights of the area was helping to that as well. then it hovered around the area for a little while and after it started going away. at this point i could clearly hear its direction and estimate its position by its sound but i could see nothing. it went quite far and stayed for some time at that distance. then it started coming back and i closed the window because i was afraid. but after a while i opened again the other window of my flat and i heard it hovering slowly around and stopped above a school football field just outside my building. it stayed there for a few minutes and then started coming towards my direction. i was scared but i tried to stay at my window. i couldn't see anything all this time but i could hear it very distinctly. it came towards my direction and passed right above my building, i even bent over the window as it was passing over the building just in case i see something, but i couldn't see anything. it sounded like it was something big, there is no way something of that size to come so close and i couldn't see it. at that moment i heard its sound better than any other moment, it was like a fast roar and when closer it had a vibrating feel and a slight metallic sound to it. at that point i got scared and i closed the window. i could hear it being out there for another 15 minutes and then it went away. when after 1 hour or so i opened the window, it was dead silent outside. i even thought the possibility that it was only my idea to hear the sound but the fact that when i closed the window the sound was damped, it was indicating that it was outside.\r\n\r\nalso i don't know if that is connected somehow to that object but the following morning at 8.30 when i went to work, the company next to the one i work had smoke next to it and the workers where running around like they wanted to distinguish a fire. i really believe that these two events are not connected to each other but i thought to mention this last one too, just in case it helps any research.\r\n\r\ni know my data are not sufficient to really identify the object because i couldn't see anything really, but i thought to submit my experience just in case there is any other witness from that event from the nearby area. i really didn't think to take my camera and film the situation because i was scared at that moment.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

there and it was cancelled. so i drove back home and decided to chill for the day. i had my jeep top down and a jacket on because it was a little chilly. i went to a liquor store and got a six pack...I bought it at 9:10 am because i had to call them because they forgot to open the doors (it's a large roger wilco on rt 73 in palmyra. i then drove to a half mile from my house where there is a soccer field and park and i was by myself and turned off the jeep and cracked open a beer or two and just relaxed looking up at the sky which was easy because my jeep top was down. \r\nin the distance a jogger was running by and i wanted to get a good look at her and remembered my binoculars in the back that i keep on the floor. i use them to look at ships on the deleware river when i park there and crack open a few beers. i looked at her, and then looked at a car or two driving by and then looked up at some airplanes making there way to the philly airport. \r\ni had another beer and then took the binoculars and looked up at some of the clouds and watched them for a moment or two...Just relaxing and enjoying myself listening to some ambient music. then i focused in on a large bird just hovering as they do in the wind stream and it was a perfect moment...And then i saw it. \r\n\r\nit just seemed so casual and natural, i only saw it for about 3 to 4 seconds but the split second i saw it i thought it was a bird like a seagull or something because it was white and (maybe) had a black part in the front. i'm not sure about that though. i instantly realized it was not a bird...It was round and it was moving fast. from my left to right. i followed it until it went behind a tree that was in front of me and i knew i would not be able to pick it up again on the other side of the tree because even if i did pick it up it would disappear instantly behind more trees.\r\n\r\nit was pretty high in the air but it was not overhead. if you bent your head and looked straight up, and then lowered your head and looked at the horizon, it was about halfway...But just slightly closer to being straight up than horizon level. it was moving straight across...It was white...White like the white on space shuttles and old nasa rockets...Exactly that white. i think there was black somewhere on it to (in the front?) but i really couldn't recall after i saw it. even though it was rather small in my binoculars...I would estimate it's size to be somewhere between a very large beachball (the kind they hit around at concerts) and a volkeswagon bug. i doubt it was smaller than the beachball and doubt it was larger than the car. if i had to guess, i think it was closer to being almost as big as a car...But that's really a guess. \r\nit was traveling fast...Really fast...But not faster than an airforce jet...Probably as fast as a jet, but definetly not faster than one.\r\n\r\nas soon as it happened i though...Did i just see a drone? then instantly realized that i saw something that was either an experimental drone or aircraft...Or something from another world. it didn't make sense to me that it would be something from the govt because if it malfunctioned  and came crashing down, in a highly populated area like i live...It would have done some damage.\r\nthe day was sunny and the object was solid and very white...It didn't shine or reflect light...Just very white. it would not have been possible to see it without binoculars.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

bedroom window, with slits. my bed is facing north but the window is south and the flying object was southwestern. it was not there when i went to bed (around 10pm). and it was no longer there after the episode. i was staring in awe at it for about 5 minutes before i decided to record. i was nervous, i really wanted to hide under covers, and barely open blinds, as i was afraid they would get me if i opened blinds all the way. i mean, they were angled almost perfectly at my window. were they there for me? anyways i saw bright white, green, pink lights. i dont think i heard noise, since my window is shut. the orbs morphed - got bigger smaller, and changed shapes and the whole object hovered and went slightly side to side, making the lights more and less bright and visible/prominent. i finally recorded, and by then the lights were only white. i was low on memory on my phone, otherwise i would have recorded more, but ran out of memory, my cell phone cut me off.  i was quickly deleted files,pics, etc so i could record more, and i had to use the bathroom, but then they were gone. i was freaked out, but also excited that i had seen something so cool! i verified it by googling images of ufos and time sighting of them and yep, this was one. and also they seem to appear on dark quiet nites like at 4am. i made sure it wasnt any cosmic sighting like meteor showers or auroras, and nope, none, and it was not the moon, as the moon was on the other side of the sky. i was so excited it took me a while to fall back asleep. when i did, i woke up at 830am and couldnt wait to tell my loved ones.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

corner house of the main road i was walking down was a slow moving flying saucer shaped craft. it was plain as day and unavoidable it was impossible not to see.I could not identify it as any known craft but i must have believed it was extraterrestrial because i telepathically tried to communicate to it not to leave. it was blue and silver and was right above me and had a blinking white light. i was trying to send telepathic messages to the beings inside and telling them not to go. it moved north slowly across the street and then changed directions heading east keeping the same speed the entire time until i lost sight of it while ascending it then changed directions and headed north. i watched it until i couldn't see it anymore. it lasted for about five minutes until i lost sight due to it being out of range with the naked eye it finally crossed over the foothills.After reviewing and embossing the video i took there appear to be 3 more objects that stand out just like the one i had my camera directed at but these other three were not close to me like the one i described.After i lost sight of it i posted the event to facebook and reported it to the san francisco office of senator feinstein's office where i have an open case with the us air force. i also requested radar tracking data from the cia and nasa in a foia request form describing the date, time, location,

60-65 mph. it was still rush hour traffic. it was still a clear,bright day at that hour.  between big bend and marshall road there is a clearing on the right side of the highway that gives a very good view of part of fenton and valley park, as well as a bit of unger park.  as the clearing afforded me this view, i then saw the object.  it was metallic grey.  it was the shape of a cylinder with a sphere above it.  the cylinder was perpendicular to the ground.  it was hovering.  it appeared to have many different mechanical devices attached to its \"hull.\"  the largest of these objects appeared to be support beams that attached the cylinder to the sphere.  there were many of these support beams and they appeared to be very sturdy.  it was very difficult to get a frame of reference as to its size, relative position to the highway, and how far above the treetops it was.  i will say it was a very large object, probably at least, the size of a small 4 to 5 story office skyscraper. it made no noise, but i may have had the windows open and my radio on, which of course may have drowned out any noise the object was making.  at first i thought it could be a balloon of some sort, but i dismissed that idea because of the metallic nature of the object and the fact that there is no balloon that i know of that would have that many objects attached to its surface.  it simply hovered in place the entire time it was in my field of view.   i was in shock at first, then i was excited and elated.  i had a great need to see it again and even considered diverting my course and attempting to track it down.  i lost site of it due to trees and cliffs that blocked the view of any vehicles traveling southbound until you reach the i-44/270 interchange, which is a very large valley.  i looked back when i reached this point and the object was gone. it took approximately 30 seconds to reach this next visible viewing area.  i am fairly certain it was high enough that had it remained in

drive and therefore lake michigan. we were on the balcony having a conversation when i happened to notice a bright orange orb ascending from the lake. i quickly alerted the two other people who were with me to the object and none of us could identify it. when we first noticed it it was perhaps a mile out onto the lake and a couple hundred feet in the air. it was rising diagonally upwards at a slow yet steady velocity. once it reached a certain altitude, it appeared to stop and head east, at which point the brightness of the object quickly diminished. once the object disappeared we resumed our conversation, only to be interrupted by an identical object rising from the lake which followed the same flight path as the last object. once this object disappeared we continued to watch the lake to see if another object would appear and if we could pinpoint its origin. sure enough, about a minute later it looked as if someone lit a fire beneath the surface of the lake or on the surface of the lake from which another orange orb rose, once again following the same flight path until it faded away in the distance. this happened 4 more times over the course of the next 5 minutes, with one orb in particular seeming significantly closer and faster than the rest. my initial thought was that someone was on the lake lighting chinese lanterns, but i was forced to dismiss this idea for several reasons. each object followed the exact same flight path, and seemed much too large be a chinese lantern. there were also no lights from a boat on the lake where somebody could be lighting them off, which from our vantage point we would have most likely been able to see. finally, who would be on the lake after midnight lighting chinese lanterns? after the event we all went inside and prepared to go to sleep, all of us still wondering what we had just witnessed.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

lights heading north. 1st there were 2 they were flying and a formation both were exactly the same both were in the south but one was further west of the other.  watched them fly the western one dimmed just a little for about 3 seconds and then was gone the other flew for about 25 seconds then another one appeared east of the second one. then the second dimmed for about 3 or 4 seconds and then it disapperaed. the 3 flew for maybe a 60 seconds and then it dimmed and disapeared also. they all was traveling the same speed not super fast but for the distance they were from the ground they were not slow. they were the same color as your amber light on dash boards. i have seen aircraft before i was in the army and know what most aircraft look like. my parents both were pilots. i also live in a flight path of kci airport and have seen many planes or jets fly over and this was not like tradtional aircraft. they were as bright as if you was looking at a street light 4 or 5 blocks away. their was no noise at all. there was a breeze very light comeing from the southeast. they seemed to be in a formation and stayed in that formation up till they disapeared. i called to my mom she came out and looked at them. and she was able to see the second one and third one. also i am 46 years old and have seen a lot of things and never seen anything flying like this. i was not scared or excited at all i just watched and noted what happened i was trying to figure out what it was and be objective about it. i am not going to say this was out of the world stuff but it was not normal

mountains of our home town. and by that they are not aleans. the problem is that they still scare me when fronted with them but i getting to learn how to not be afraid of them , its been a long road but to any one that has never seen them befor thay seem to be as monsters. the way to overcome the fear is to look into there eyes and see the beauty that they are and let them know your not here to hurt them. then open your mind to pureness that they are all around you. witch im starting to do well. my bigest problem is when its gets dark the fear takes over me and i cant stay and i
