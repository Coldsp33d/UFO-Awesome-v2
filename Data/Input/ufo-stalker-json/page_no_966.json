a casa después de almorzar, y subí a la terraza para tomar el sol. el cielo estaba despejado, no había nubes, y se podía ver al volcán galeras muy bello, muy iluminado por el sol. pero había una forma extraña en las faldas del galeras que me llamó la atención. yo veo todos los días a mi volcán y lo conozco muy bién y lo que tenía en frente no era normal. una pequeña luz estaba de frente al volcán con un destello leve pero constante, no se movía, pero lo seguí mirandolo, entonces, su tamaño comenzo a crecer, y con esto el nivel de luminosidad. la luz se hizo muy fuerte, y se podía divisar cómo el ovni giraba sobre sí mismo. esto duró aprox. 15 minutos. luego, regreso a su tamaño original y poco a poco se intridujo en el volcán de manera horizontal, penetrando la parte frontal del volcan desapareciendo de mi vista. \r\nesperé y esperé a que salga y nada.... entonces entré a internet para informarme si alguien en facebook lo había visto, pero no encontré nada... \r\npasaron casi 20 minutos, cuando mi compañera de vivienda, subió a verme y le conté que había visto un ovni, y ella se rió, no me creía. le conté todo sin convencerla, pero en ese momento, el ovni volvió a salir y esta vez mi amiga lo vió. se asustó mucho por que el objeto volvió a realizar exactamente el mismo movimiento que yo ví, incluso  se acercó mucho más hacia nosotras que la primera vez que lo ví. ella vio clara su forma y como giraba. luego el ovni entré de nuevo en el volcán y no volvió a salir más. eran como las 14:40 cuando no lo vimos más. luego, salí a trabajar y no volví a ver nada. en estos días he estado muy pendiente de lo que pasa en mi volcán galeras... por estas fechas suele alterarse la actividad volcanica en la zona y me gustaría ver otra vez este suceso para poder grabarlo. lastimosamente el celular no graba de tan lejos. yo vivo en pasto-nariño-colombia. masomenos a 6-7 km en línea recta del volcán. es muy facil verlo, pero siento que tiene visitas muy seguidas de estas

jupiter, alder baron and the moon alleged and they were around there brightest on the 13th and 14th of july, observable from colorado. nasa confirms this, so at the time i was up observing the serenity of it all. on july 14 at 2:00am and 2:30am there were two flashes that filled the sky and made it almost as bright as daylight for several seconds. my watch started running backwards, my cell phone was working and sending text to the same number i text earlier on its own. very spooky. i was very close to the event although a hill obstructed my view slightly. i went to top of hill and about 10ft diameter crushed vegetation, i saw no orbs or anything else that night, just the explosions.\r\n on july 13 from 1am to 3am i observed 3 lights converging and then slowly moving away from each other, in an obtuse triangle pattern. i have never seen anything like this. my mood and others around were greatly affected. on july 15 i noticed black metal barrels at several locations around town while driving with friends. as we looked at the shipping address they were all the same, a kaiser permanence near 56th and ward. that's the only thing i could google in that area. these barrels were located near the first days events, at a shopping center near alameda and broadway and a neighborhood near old town littleton. maybe it was just a coincidence but i think they could have been soil samples for whatever purpose. each time there was 4 to 6 barrels. i was followed by a red light as i walked for several miles away from areas that i could see on the night of july 15, 2013. i figure this could have been an unmanned drone or something but i had all these visions for hours as i walked and unlimited energy. all very strange. i can go into the visions later but some showed aliens using sound to propel there crafts, like singing. some explained why certain races disappeared. ect. all very foreign stuff to me and one day i could share in detail. also during this time there were strange folks coming up to me and saying strange things, looking abnormal, one man was like 6ft8, skinny and pale white. he told me many things like where they were from and that i was being watched.

almost directly above me and that was strange. it didn't move. it grew brighter for a couple of seconds then faded out or ascended within a few more seconds until it completely disappeared. i stayed out for another 10 minutes and saw nothing else out of the ordinary.

stealth?), and the noise remained dull and never changed until it faded. no special manouvre sounds or changes. i could not see any other planes in the sky at all. please note, the level of disconnect from the noise and the way the craft moved may have led another witness to suggest they were unrelated.\r\n\r\nit happened so fast and with such stealth that even if someone had been right next to me it would have been difficult to get the person to look quickly enough. it certainly had me staring in the sky for the next 30 minutes with no luck.\r\n\r\nwith my rational head on, i would say this craft (although amazing and unknown to civilian observers) is not outside the realms of human capability. but this thought also made me shudder: \"there are humans sat in that thing??\".\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":59931,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":52.6329213,"location":null,"logNumber":"NL-09202014-0004","longitude":4.746929199999999,"occurred":1411205400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Holland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1411230615000,"summary":"Chevron/boomerang dark craft with red light at each wingtip and one at the front","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"Europe/Amsterdam","timeZoneName":"Europe/Amsterdam","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files/59931_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"1811PC","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Alkmaar, North Holland","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:102542"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Los Banos","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"About 630 7 pm while at the los banos flea market my 6 yr old asked what was in the sky?
