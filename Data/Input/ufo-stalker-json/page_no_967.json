facing south and was looking at the sky when i noticed a bright starlike light almost directly overhead.  the sky was still blue but the sun was setting on the horizon. the sky was slightly hazy but clear where i was looking.  i wondered if it was an aircraft with its landing lights on.  i walked over to a pole in my yard and watched it  while sighting it above the pole to check for movement.  i watched for 3 or 4 minutes but it wasn't moving.    there were no other stars out yet just this bright unmoving light that i didn't recognize.  i went in an grabbed my binoculars and looked at the light while laying on my porch.  the light didn't flash or pulsate it was white and bright.  i thought it must be a weather balloon reflecting light off the setting sun.  it had a strange shape in the binoculars reminded me of a shuttlecock laying on its side.  i then went inside my house to get my ipad to take a picture of it.  when i got outside it was gone.  i was only in the house about 15 seconds.  i scanned the sky for the next 10 minutes and noticed a starlike light  almost directly overhead moving south it brightened and dimmed into nothingness within 5 seconds like an iridium flare, it was close to where the stationary bright light was earlier.  it seemed strange to me since i have some knowledge of astronomy and have years of experience stargazing and watching the sky.  it wasn't a chinese lantern as i have lighted some over the 4 th of july and watched them fly off into the

following the plane that was leaving the trails.  i have attached the pictures for your review.  in the second picture not only is there this other object, but off to the right of it there is a

time was approximately 8:10 pm. on friday september 12, 2014. as we neared the turn to our house, we noticed three bright red lights in the northeast sky well above the treeline. they weren't blinking but just a bright steady red. it appeared they were moving slowly. one minute later we had parked in the driveway. i went into the street to see if i could get a better view. there are a lot of large trees and leaves that made it hard to see. as i looked up, i saw a perfectly round shaped disc clearing the trees right above my head but a little north of my position. it was quite high. it was hard to estimate the size but i assume it was quite large. i called to my girlfriend who joined me and was amazed at the craft. it appeared to be a mottled colour of tan and pinkish and light grey. it definitely wasn't silver. the color seemed very uneven almost pulsating but not bright. rather dullish. there were clouds in the sky but we saw this against the late blue of the sky. it was almost directly above our heads. it seemed to cruise slowly in a southwest direction until in vanished into some clouds. that is where we lost sight of it. although quite high (i have to assume) it still looked about the size of nickel if i made a circle with my forefinger and thumb and made no sound as it slowly flew by. as we looked over the house, in a southerly direction, we noticed two red glowing objects cruising in the same direction. they appeared to be two separate lights because they were quite a distance apart. one seemed much higher. i live near a small airport and have seen planes in the sky before but i have to say that these lights were different. they weren't blinking. just a bright steady red cruising through the sky slowly. they too disappeared past our limit of vision. i went to the backyard to see if i could see them as my girlfriend went for a camera but they were no longer visible. this is the first time in my life or ours that we have witnessed something so unusual. we initially saw three bright red lights and when i went into the street a minute or so later is when i noticed the disc object overhead and only saw the two red lights a couple of minutes later. they all seemed to be going in the same direction but i would say miles apart. i have done a fair amount of research on the internet regarding this subject and was quite elated that this has happened to me. my girlfriend on the other hand remarked that it made her feel very unsettled or uneasy about the sighting. sincerely this event happened just as i have described it.","distance":"501

mo. i was in my crown vic. it was just before midnight. an orange light got my attention out of my left peripheral vision. i looked to my left which would be due south of my position. i was surprised to see an orange fireball the size of an aspirin at arms length. it was moving at the speed and altitude of a satellite descending to the southwest. i grabbed my camcorder and began filming. it looked like a campfire in the sky. it was obviously flaming but leaving no trail or debris. my camcorder began going in and out of focus. i began to lose sight of the fireball as it went behind telephone polls and buildings. i got out of the crown vic to attempt another shoot, but it was no good. it was gone. the whole thing happened in probably just under two minutes. initially, when the fireball was due left of me at approximately 9 o'clock (i.E. 45 degrees), i was struggling to remove my camcorder from my backpack and the zipper got caught in the threading. by the time i got it out the fireball had traversed considerably further to the southwest. in the short time that i filmed it, as the camcorder came in and out of focus, i managed to obtain two distinct focal points. when i got off work, i transferred the film to dvd. i was able to zoom (i.E. magnify) the images to the 4th power. what i was hoping to see is what i refer to as a \"light signature.\" a pronouncement indicative of an energy source. i was not let down. what is evident in all of the images, both focused and unfocused, is something white-hot at the center of what appears to be a flaming ball of orange plasma. it is evident that the orange plasma is secondary to the white-hot intensity of what lies at the heart, or the center of the anomaly. ever-so-often the object or objects at the center, because in many cases i was able to count as many as four would suddenly emit a searingly white-hot burst of light that would flood the whole chamber of the surrounding plasma, and immediately return to an orange fireball with a white-hot center. at this point i am just filled with amazement.  no answers. sounds did not sync up with video for some reason, so we opted to mute the video.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

confused and asked if falling/shooting stars can do that. i told her those ain't stars, that's something else. we observed them for about 5-10 minutes before they just disappeared into the night sky 1
