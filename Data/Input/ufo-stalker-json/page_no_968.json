45 degrees. i then turn my head to look at it and it was stationary for about 10 or 15 seconds and then decended quickly changing colors to red. then it ascended quickly to almost where it started then turned blue and shot ten degrees ten degrees to the southest and stopped. at this point my wife was exiting her van and i pointed to it and told her to watch it, she observed it moving southward slowly changing colors and decend quickly. that was the last i could observe it because it when behind a tree and i lost track of it. i recorded the object with my smart phone but i could not see it when i replayed the video. i still have the video maybe it can be lighted up.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

and saw what appeared to be the same (or same type?) object that i reported in case number 59412.  it was hovering noiselessly at what appeared to be a similar altitude as my other report.  it behaved much the same way it did in my last report with little zig zag and slow ascents and descents.  more of the \"lightening\" flashes accompanied it, however this time they were to the northeast.  there was also the same creepy feeling and dead silence.  \r\n\r\nsince the other sighting, i've been a little more prepared and had a pair of binoculars near the door.  i got those and used a porch post to make sure they would be steady and located the object.  through the binoculars i could see a pattern of dim lights in a v formation with the point almost directly facing my direction.  the very back lights was a dim red then blue then a greenish white (  that wasn't visible with the naked eye) then the brilliant white.  as i watched one would flash brightly then quickly dim and another would quickly flash in what appeared to be a random order.  none of the lights ever completely went out though.  \r\n\r\ni also believe it to be one solid object rather than eight  as i was watching it, i observed a smaller white light shoot away from it at high speed.  it sped away to the east and also flashed.  though it stayed only white. it was clearly visible through the binoculars, however my mom could see it dimly with the naked eye as well.  \r\n\r\njust as my other report, it slowly made it's way up and away to the northeast as the \"lightening\" tapered off.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

approximately 4:40am on the morning of 9/16/2014. my husband just went back inside for a minute. i was staring up at the sky, stargazing as i very often do. it's a treat when i get to see a meteorite or even a passing satellite. but this time... \r\n\r\nthere were two very bright, but very high lights passing from east to west. i've seen many satellites passing in my life, and if i had to guess, they were many miles from each other, but within about 5 degrees from each other in my field of view. they looked like most satellites do when passing, a white to red/orange reflective light, but they were slightly brighter than other satellites i had observed.  one following the other perfectly. \r\n\r\nthen, a few seconds after i saw them, they rotated about an axis and switched positions while still moving west, and continued on in perfectly swapped places. then the new lead light continued on, while the new trailing light veered off south and disappeared. the leading light soon disappeared (faded) as i would expect of a satellite reentering the earth's shadow.\r\n\r\nall of this in the span of 15-20 seconds. my observation covered an arc of about 45 degrees from the time i noticed until the remaining light was not visible.\r\n\r\ni have observed many passing satellites, the space station, the old shuttles in my life.  i am a smoker who is up late night and early morning and go outside and stare at the sky.  i've never seen an event like this, and my main reaction was to repeatedly say out loud \"what the f#&$\".  and this was of course one of the few times i've walked

feared.\r\n\r\n1. i was in my grandfathers garden 1/2 mile from home in the middle of nowhere. it was my turn that night to sit in the garden until after dark to shoot at and scare away the predators that were eating the crop...Mostly deer, rabbits and raccoon. \r\n\r\n2. i arrived to the garden by foot about 8:15 pm and took my post in the corn rows. i noticed some deer jumping the fence into the garden area right at dusk (approx 9:10 pm.). i waited a few minutes for the rest of the deer to enter the garden before lifting myself above the corn stalks to fire away. when i quietly raised up on my knee, i noticed the deer were gone and that the street lights had come on. even though i did not know it at the time, this was my first sighting of the object. \r\n\r\n3. being a city boy, my first thought of the light was that it was the street lights coming on since it was dusk. since i was not alarmed, i looked back to the dirt and continued drawing naked stick figures and lust notes to my sweetheart back home. suddenly it dawned on me that there are no street lights out here. as a matter of fact, there are no houses or people on the property where i \"saw\" the light because we have very few neighbors for miles. at this point, i focused my attention on the \"street light\" in the next pasture 300' away.\r\n\r\n4. numbers four and five of the guide may be repeated since the object appeared, disappeared and reappeared to interact with me on numerous occasions. \r\n   4.A). i observed the light 300' away due east and slightly above the tree line in the next pasture. i thought it was unusual because there was no homestead in that direction. i observed the light for at least five minutes or so as it moved from side to side (north to south) over the pasture. it never made a noise and did not light up the landscape. it was an orange yellow glow that did not emit light and it quietly, smoothly and slowly hovered above ground as it moved from side to side.\r\n   4b. after a while, the light shot straight up into the sky without a noise and disappeared straight in the air. at this point, i was not scared and thinking like a normal fifteen year old boy. it was cool that i could tell my friends that i saw a ufo. at this point, that is all it was.\r\n   4c. after several minutes thinking how cool the sighting was, i turned on the miner's light fashioned to my head to walk home. suddenly the object reappeared and descended directly above me. i fell to the ground and cowered on my back with my 22 rifle pointed at the light as it continued its descent directly above me. thinking the glowing light was seeing my miners light, i turned off my light and kept my 22 rifle pointed at the descending light. \r\n   4d. the glowing light continued its descent until it was only 25' above me. at this point, i distinctly saw a silver metallic disk hovering over me. after a short time (seconds or minutes i don't recall), a door in the center of the bottom of the disc slid open and an apparatus extruded itself from the saucer that to me looked like a suction cup on the end of it. the whole time this was going on, neither the ground around me nor was i lit up with light. in other words, the craft did not emit light and it was totally silent. \r\n   4e most importantly, when the disk was hovering above me with the apparatus protruding from the bottom,i was able to observe the motion of the disc. it was not spinning or warbling or bouncing. it was gently oscillating back and forth between 45 degree angles.\r\n   4f. thinking i was going to be sucked into the craft, i continued to keep my rifle pointed at the craft knowing i would never pull the trigger. to be honest, at this point i figured my grandparents would track me to here and never find me again. \r\n   4g. after an unknown time expired, the apparatus that looked like a suction cup to me was retracted into the bottom of the saucer shaped craft and the door on the bottom of the disc closed shut. within five minutes of the door closing, the object shot straight up in the sky and disappeared over the west horizon at a very high rate of speed. never once making a sound and never breaking the sound barrier, even though its rate of speed far exceeded the military jets that we commonly saw and heard break the sound barrier. \r\n   4h. thankful the encounter was over, i lay trembling on the ground 1/2 mile from home in the middle of nowhere. i was small for my age and very slow to boot. i got up to lumber home and suddenly the object re appeared from the eastern horizon and silently shot directly overhead. it paused very briefly as i stared at the object with my miner's light on and then it dove directly towards me. \r\n   4i. i was mesmerized by the the object and dove head first into the pea patch while keeping my eye on the object. as it swooped directly at me at about a 45 degree angle, i saw the full shape of the disc and then it became a full fledged flying saucer. it got so close to me that i could see the full cross section of the saucer with what i perceived as windows and i closed my eyes and began to make deals with god.I did not open my eyes for many minutes (at least five minutes) and found myself alone in the wild when i found the courage to open my eyes. i was afraid to open my eyes for fear of what i might see in the windows.\r\n\r\n5.The best way to describe my feelings is unadulterated fear because of the isolation in the country. even though i did my best to remain alert the entire time and make meticulous mental notes once i realized this may be a once in a lifetime event, there is no way to share with the world what i know i saw.\r\n\r\n6. i lost sight of the saucer when i closed my eyes and refused to open them.\r\n \r\nmy close encounter is the single most significant event in my life. after laying in the dirt for minutes once i opened my eyes again, i had to decide if i should try to run home or wait for my grandparents to come find me. being the slowest kid on the team and in the school, i went against conventional wisdom and made the conscious decision that running home was in my best interest. the knowledge of the physics of speed imparted on me for survival have continued to carry me far in life.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500

crusing at very high altitude. i saw at least 6 planes cruising at very high altitude, probably 30k to 36k feet, following two routes patrern from east to west. every single one of the planes had very visible chemtrails. \r\nthen i realized there was a extremely bright esphere by one of the airplanes. it stroke me as odd, because it was too early yet for stars to appear in the sky. i told my wife to look at it, and we both realized that the brightness of the object was coming from the reflection of the sun light. it was definitely metalic and reflecting the sun light. but how could that be? the object was in the form of a large esphere, about 2 to 3 times the size of the airplane nearby it. it was crusing along the airplane. about the same altitude and same speed. no chemtrail whatsoever! we realized then that we could be looking at a ufo! we were very skeptical at first. but then the object which seemed to be following the airplane, turned to the opposite side, and start accelerating eastward. the speed in which it was going was about 10 times the speed of the planes. then it just went straight up and the bright faded until it was gone out of sight, which took about 3

to go back to sleep but i couldn't so i went outside on my balcony with my ex wife . i could not see any helicopters , but i did see a small cessna airplane flying low approach in our local airport . and as i was looking at the bottom of the plane , in the airspace between the plane and me about 30 white orbs appeared out of thin air . i kept asking my ex , what is that , what is that . they were all at the same altitude moving at the same slow speed . when all of a sudden a few of them changed colors . the one i was looking at turned red and i went from wonder to fear very quickly . i then went out side to follow them and just like that they disappeared . they were in a cluster formation the whole time they were visable . no sound at all . another time me and my ex wife were on the balcony at night were we saw a long flat rectangle shape probe slowly flying barley above the roof tops . at first sight it looked crome like a car bumper , but as it flew by we literally saw it slowly turn invisible like the predator . it made no noise , it had no wings , propellers , or jets . it was so close i could have hit it with a rock . just a flat long rectangle .

and planets on saturday evening, september 13. we have a large star field and good visibility from the farm we live on.  we noticed an odd orb shape in the sky, and turned our google sky map towards it, but it did not indicate that anything should be there of significance. we noticed that the orb was pulsing different colors randomly, and moving in jerky motions up and down, side to side. sometimes big jumps, sometimes small. we watched for a while as it continued to do this to see if it moved from the area, but it did not. we then both individually noticed and commented on at the same time, seeing a large white flash of light, like a flashbulb going off in the sky to the right of the object, and streaking straight towards it, creating a trail of light behind it.  i thought that might be a shooting star, but it looked more like an explosion and moved straight across towards the pulsating orb, dissapearing into it.\r\n\r\nmy daughters and i watch the nightsky a lot, and this
