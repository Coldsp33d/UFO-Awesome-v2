second. we thought it was the garage opening, cause it sounded close.  but it was unusual, unlike anything we ever heard before. it was so loud it caused alarm. so we immediately went outside. several neighbors went outside to expressing concern and alarm. the dogs in the neighborhood were barking then they got very quiet. this is when we looked directly north of the home and saw in the direct path of my home and my neighbor's home some very low lights in the sky, amber in color and changing color with some reds. we watched it for about 1 minute. it was stationary at this time, then it started to move to the west very slowly without sound. it was about 1/2 mile away at this time. shortly after i went to the 7/11 directly north about half a mile from me. asked the attendant did he hear any strange noise. he said yes, and all the power went out just in the 7/11. this would put the objects path directly over the 7/11 at the time of seeing the lights. the attendant said the computers all failed and nothing was working.  after the lights dimmed the object could not be seen any longer. heard a helicopter about 15 minutes after the object was seen. did not see the helicopter. i found this strange cause in the beach community it is extremely quiet we do not get air traffic so late.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

stopped the car to look, there was still plenty of light in the sky but the sun was at a descending angle allowing the light to shire sideways on the craft and actually making it more visible. i saw a dark possibly black triangular craft hovering perfectly still and making no noise. there where 3 indented lines from each corner to a center orb or dome shape protruding from the bottom. in each corn at the end of each of these indentations was a red light the center dome was white and luminescent. the triangle hovered of a few moments then turned and accelerated away. it started slow but very quickly accelerated faster and faster, from the time it started moving to the time it sped up to what i could perceive as full speed only a few seconds passed, maybe 7 seconds. the sighting took place at the top of a hill and allowed a view distance of a few miles at the elevation the ufo was at, and from the time it reached full speed while accelerating away it few that distance of a few miles and moved out of sight in an additional 5 seconds. i was in the military and have see many high speed aircraft, including blue angel f-18 and hornets and i have never seen any man made aircraft that moved that fast and made no noise while hovering, the craft did not maneuver anything more then turning and flying off in a straight line, but it was definitely faster then what man made air craft i have seen and i have seen quite a few military craft. unfortunately i did not have a camera with me, (of course... :-( ). i did however find a photo that some one else took of the exact same type of object . this photo is not a picture i took but it does perfectly illustrate what is looked like, the picture i found  was taken by another person who saw the same object some where else and apparently is the same craft i saw. i have added it to this file.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Patterned

this is when the goosebumps hit and i started feeling very hot all over, especially my back. i started hollering for my wife and son to come out. the formation broke apart to 3 single stars again, then back into formation. i never observed movement, just a sudden re-arrangement if you will. i am certain i saw a perfect circle in the sky, motionless and of equal brightness amongst the \"stars\" that created it. it was about the size of a half dollar if i held it out as far from my eyes as possible. by the time my wife and son came out there were only 2 stars remaining. they started to change brightness back and forth, one would get bright and the other would get dim and back-and-forth slowly and evenly, not at all randomly. after several more minutes they just dimmed out completely. this was about 8:10 pm or so. the next 15 minutes i saw two meteors and two of the super bright lights appear that i described in the beginning of this post, though they were not as high in the sky as this event and seemed unrelated. it was the first truly unexplained thing i have seen in the sky other than these stationary lights that blink out \"all the time\".","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":59850,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1088065,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09152014-0012","longitude":-94.57317669999999,"occurred":1410662700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1410816335000,"summary":" meteor-like object broke into several objects that created a formation.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"64152","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Kansas City, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:103975"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Holyoke","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My girlfriend and i were driving at 8:10pm when we looked over to the east from the highway(91 north) and above/slightly east of the holyoke mall were 4 orange orbs in the shape of a parallelogram approximately 50-100 feet apart from one another in the sky . the objects were not moving. \r\n\r\n\r\nwe then got off at the next exit and began to drive to the location where it appeared that they were. we got back on the highway and traced our path but did not see the objects again.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":59849,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.211268600000004,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09152014-0011","longitude":-72.6073009,"occurred":1410750600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1410813922000,"summary":"4 orange glowing lights in shape of parallelogram hovering above city","tags":["lights","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"01040","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Holyoke, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:103976"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Coimbra","country":"Portugal","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Ok. i wanted to take a photo of a tree in the botanical garden in coimbra and accidentally i photographed this ufo.

january 2014, approximately 10:00 in the evening. i looked out the 2nd story bathroom window when i saw a blinding halogen type large light that seemed to be hovering over the school across the street. at first i wondered if it was a helicopter but found that to be odd. i was stunned by its brilliance and could not look away. the light then proceeded to come slowly toward my home at rooftop level. i could not\r\nlook away although the light hurt my eyes. as the craft flew directly over my home i looked up underneath and saw two large rectangular lights one bright blue and if i remember correctly the other was red. because the white light of the craft was so blinding- even though the craft was so close to me as i looked out the window i could not make out a shape or an accurate size although i feel it was much larger than two cars.  it was so close to the roof of my home i felt very frightened. it was also so close i felt i could have thrown something at it and hit it in retrospect. \r\nas it passed out of my view i ran to the back of my home to look out my son's bedroom window to see it as it passed over and away from my home. i wanted my son to see it who was in his bedroom. in the time it took me to run down the hall, and look out the window, the craft had already passed over the subdivision and was as far away as the rural concession road and nothing more that a bright white light.  this suggests a change of speed because the object came quite slowly across the street and flew slowly over my home.  of course  i was upset and telling my son about what i had witnessed when he mocked me saying it was an airplane in the distance. the object just flew out of sight.\r\n\r\nthe fact i saw this object so close to me, scared me for quite a few months and it
