looked too low, too large, and too bright to be an aircraft, but i thought it might be a helicopter. i rolled down my window expecting to hear the sounds of rotors, but heard nothing, complete silence. as i pulled in my driveway, keeping my eyes on it, it didn’t appear to be moving. i got out of my car and stared intently at the light, which at the time appeared to be one big round light. i still heard nothing. the object started moving straight up and it appeared that another much smaller light off to the right of the object flashed brighter for a second, and i couldn’t really determine the direction, but it appeared that a beam of light flashed between the larger object and the smaller one. then the smaller one appeared to blink out. the object then stopped moving up and started moving in a northeasterly direction. as it passed over, i appeared to have two rows of yellow lights, fore and aft, with other white lights blinking in a diamond pattern. it picked up speed and was moving away rapidly, and the fire and aft lights appeared to turn white. before it got too much farther away, the lights appeared to turn green. there was absolutely no noise, from the first sighting to when it disappeared, which seemed unusual for how close it was to the ground. when it first started ascending, before the other object appeared to flash or be flashed by this object, there was an airplane in the same general vicinity, moving fairly fast, but far higher in the sky, judging by comparative size. we have a small airport here as well as a national guard base, so i’m used to all kinds of aircraft, but this was unusual for its pattern of movement, size, and complete lack of sound.","distance":"101-500

10:15pm. the road itself is 4 lanes wide (2 each way) and reasonably straight, surrounded by trees but has no street lights or any other kind of lighting. there was no other traffic around at the time either, i did not see any other cars for most of my drive.\r\n\r\nit was a warm night and perfectly clear, all the stars were visible and there were no clouds at all. i had the roof down in my convertible because it was so nice, this gave me a wide field of view that would typically be missed.\r\n\r\na bright yellow light came into my peripheral vision from the east very high up, moving quickly across the sky. it caught my attention immediately because it was the brightest object in the sky, it was also much faster than the couple of commercial passenger jets that i had seen earlier. at first i thought it was just a satellite or shooting star, so i slowed the car to have a better look. as i focused on it i noticed a slightly smaller (but still more noticeable than the rest of the stars) light was moving in sync with the larger one, except circling around it as well. i couldn't tell if it was a completely different 'object' or if it was one 'object' with one central light and one outer light spinning around.\r\n\r\nit was very difficult to judge the distances or size of the lights, because they seemed very far away in the sky with nothing nearby for reference. the larger light was roughly a quarter of the size of a normal full moon, but much brighter, so it was dominant among other stars. the smaller one was about half that size.\r\n\r\nthey moved from the left of the sky (east direction) to around the centre of my vision at a constant speed, while the smaller one was rotating around the main light. they both came to an instant halt, which was when i realised this was not normal. i slowed the car more to get a better look. the lights began to move around again, the main one making perfect 90 degree changes of direction and even halting occasionally, all while the smaller one was rotating around it. there was never any period of acceleration from them, it was either a fast movement or completely stationary. \r\n\r\nafter a few zigzag type maneuvers they were stationary for 15 seconds or so, it felt like a long time but i know it was not. they then suddenly started moving \"straight\" up at great speed, flashed much brighter than they had been previously and vanished. like a warp drive from a sci-fi movie or something like that.\r\n\r\nthere was no noticeable sound either... however that is hard to be certain about considering the engine

un supuesto ufóloga para informarle sobre algo extraño que vi y fotografié en junio de ese año, y otra cosa que un compañero camionero vio y fotografió en santa cruz, pero nunca se comunicó alguien conmigo.\r\nyo mostraba una insignia en un vehículo que algunas otras personas dicen haber visto en el sur de argentina.\r\nen julio de 2017 con aquel compañero vendimos nuestros camiones viejos y con un préstamo nos compramos un camión nuevo para largas distancias y ahora hacemos transporte a la patagonia y con eso nos ganamos la vida.\r\na los dos nos empezó a apasionar el tema y compramos cámara de fotos y binoculares importantes para registrar si vemos algo en nuestros viajes por las rutas.\r\na fines de octubre y principios tuvimos carga para comodoro rivadavia, caleta olivia, puerto deseado y puerto san julián, llegando a c. rivadavia el día 30/10 y p.S. julián el día 8/11.\r\ndespués de entregar y cargar en p. deseado, en lugar de volver los 121 km por la r.N. 281 hasta la r.N. 3, decidimos seguir hacia el sur por la r.P. 47 de ripio que sale desde tellier y hace unos 129 km hasta empalme con la r.P. 87 que hace 22 km hasta tres cerros sobre la r.N. 3.\r\na unos 6 km antes de llegar a tres cerros vemos estacionado a la derecha del camino un 4x4 blanco y 3 personas de a pie algunos metros afuera del camino extendiendo algo así como una antena de unos 4 metros, bajamos la velocidad y paramos al lado del 4x4 (modelo evoque) entonces otra persona que estaba adentro se bajó y nos saludó, preguntamos si tenían algún desperfecto y nos dijo que estaba todo bien y nos dio las gracias.\r\nal seguir vimos en el capot del 4x4 el mismo signo que vi en 2016 (mando aquella foto del 2016) en el litoral, y después mi compañero en santa cruz.\r\nno nos animamos a sacar fotos esta vez por temor ya que la persona que se bajó del 4x4 fue muy respetuosa pero al mismo tiempo hablaba de una forma extraña y muy seria.\r\nhicimos menos de 1 km y vimos a la derecha del camino arriba una lomada y justo en el borde aterrizado un helicóptero blanco de gran tamaño que tenía por lo menos 5 hileras de ventanas, era mas grande que el helicóptero presidencial y tenía a un lado el mismo signo y además era totalmente blanco.\r\nla presencia del helicóptero nos preocupó un poco así que solo lo vimos con binoculares mientras bajamos la velocidad.\r\nunos 500 metros más adelante, a 500 metros antes de empezar una subida donde a la izquierda del camino hay una casa de hecha de piedra, vimos a nuestra derecha calculamos que como a 500 metros dentro de un cañadón un objeto negro, de forma cuadrada y calculamos que tenía al menos 10 metros por lado, casi aterrizado en el suelo.\r\nparamos y tratamos de sacar fotografías pero la cámara (modelo d7200 de una marca conocida) tenía la batería descargada, le cambiamos la batería y apuntamos pero la cámara no podía hacer foco y daba error, un instante después se le descargó la batería `por completo, así que le pusimos otra batería y apuntamos y disparamos y luego esta batería también se agotó.\r\nlas fotografías digitales solo muestran un resplandor intenso como si alguien habría estado apuntando a la cámara con una linterna potente muy de cerca.\r\nleímos un poco de esto y pensamos que fue algo que salió del objeto pero nosotros no vimos con los ojos nada que viniera para el camión donde estábamos adentro, porque nunca nos bajamos sino que abrimos la ventanilla y los paneles del lado derecho para poder mirar mejor y sacar las fotos.\r\nentonces el objeto que era completamente negro empezó a elevarse sin hacer ruido, primero muy lentamente y después cada vez mas rápido hasta perderse en el cielo, miramos para atrás y el helicóptero voló hacia atrás de nosotros con dirección al este, no volvimos a ver el 4x4.\r\npudimos ver el objeto con binoculares, era cuadrado como un cubo, no tenía marcas ni señales, ni nada, los lados eran lisos y de un negro muy oscuro, es decir de un negro muy negro.\r\nno tenía antenas, y parecía que estaba aterrizado pero en realidad estaba casi rozando el suelo y debajo de él había como una iluminación muy tenue, casi no se podía distinguir.\r\nesperamos algunos minutos y primero pensamos en ir al lugar pero después pensamos que el objeto podría haber dejado algún residuo o radiación peligrosa así que decidimos que no era prudente.\r\ny seguimos viaje para tres cerros.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

made pulsating noise.  i felt sick like dizzy, nausea as it began to move off.  i blacked out. i woke up inside my house.  sightings are not a big deal to me.  i have seen the crafts a few times.  its the abductions that i have concerns about.  all of my life these things have happened to me but nobody ever believes me.  they treat me as if im crazy.  no, im not a cop, preacher, nor politician but that doesn`t make my case any less real.  since i was a child these things have been happening to me.  my mom and dad would come into my room as i sat up in my bed crying without having any clue as to why.  bad dreams, they would ask.  no, it was not bad dreams.  i would awaken with the craziest feeling in my head.  the main thing i remember is the intense pulsating and the paralysation.  i am grown now so the fear has diminished quite a bit and has been replaced with curiosity. what do they want?  why will they not let me meet them?  i mean sure, i can see it being scary as ever to wake up looking at an alien of some sort but i want to know what they want.  i caught a glimpse out of the corner of my eye once about two years ago and there it stood but vanished in an instance.  i remember wrinkled features on its face and it was about 4 and a half to five feet tall.  not green but actually pale skinned.  not giant bug eyes but just larger eyes.   i have even sent a portion of my journal to mufon but even they ignore me.  i wish i could be hypnotised as so many others have been because i guarantee you that they will know the truth of the matter at that point.  honestly this sighting is from a year ago and i have not been bothered for quite a while.  but it only makes me more anxious, waiting for the next time it happens.
