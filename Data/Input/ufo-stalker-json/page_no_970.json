enjoying a clear, cloudless, night and starry mountain sky. there was no moon out and no wind. we were in a mountainous area, with tall evergreen trees around our small clearing/meadow, so we could see maybe 1/3 of the sky. we could barely make out the nearest granite mountain peak (above the tree line) to our north-west.\r\n\r\nour campfire was probably the only light within a 5 or 10 mile radius - except maybe for car lights on the two lane highway 50 past placerville which we had come in on.\r\n\r\ni happened to look up and saw a strange, sparkling star-like object about at the zenith. but it was larger than a star, being a tiny visible sphere, maybe the size of a pea held at arms length. it was a golden color and had a peculiar sparkling quality - not twinkling, but like throwing off a lot of sparks. as i watched it, it began to circle over us (or maybe it was already circling) and then seemed to get larger and brighter. after it completed a couple of perfect circle descending spirals it became obvious that it was descending toward us. that is, the we were at the center of it's descending circular spirals.  as it continued this smooth, even, silent, well co-ordinated spiral descent, i became fearful.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend had not noticed the object and for some reason, perhaps a protective reflex, i didn't want her to.\r\n\r\nnow the object was closer and i think i remember it casting a glow on the surrounding terrain. it how appeared like a 4th of july sparkler, with the whole golden surface made of something like outward moving sparks, but much shorter than on a sparkler and many more of them.\r\n\r\nat this point, i put out our fire and pretty much dragged my girlfriend into our tent, saying it was time to go to sleep. although i had been very frightened, i was somehow almost instantly asleep and remember only that i saw a lot of flashing lights through the tent fabric as i went to sleep. i thought to myself that i had not put the fire out properly and the wind had come up suddenly and was blowing the fire back alight and the campfire was casting a lot of bright flickering lights and shadows onto the tent fabric. but this was strictly a rationalization - there was no evidence of that and i heard no wind nor any other sounds.\r\n\r\nthe next morning we woke up normally, packed up and left. for some reason i made no mention of the ufo and did not look around for any physical evidence. we just packed up and hiked back to my car. i never mentioned the event to her. a few months later, we ended our relationship and i lost track of her.\r\n\r\nwere we abducted? i don't know. a couple of years ago, during a routine exam, my doctor asked me about a scar and small lesion near the center of my chest. he asked how i had been wounded. i could only say that i had no idea and no memory of any such trauma. i had been aware of that scar for years. i looked for that scar recently and it has vanished -

appeared at first to be a meteor, except that it travelled more slowly and lingered longer in its descent than normal meteors do in just a fraction of a second.  the bright light appeared next to “hive off” until 4 objects were now continuing the downward path and then disappeared below the tree line.  the total time that elapsed was about 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nthe light was in the nw part of the sky and travelled downward to the right.  it looked to be approximately 1 mile or so distant.  i judge the size of the objects to be somewhere between 10 and 25 feet, although that is very difficult to know for certain.\r\n\r\neach of the objects was as bright as the original and the downward flight path did not deviate from the slope it originally had begun, roughly 45°.   what is especially interesting, is that these lights descended to the same exact place that the bright sphere emerged from on august 31.  (see reported case # 59513).\r\n\r\nas previously reported, this area to which these lights descended is uninhabited, and forms the western shore of blue springs lake, and the lake itself.   it is not known if the lights descended into the lake, or if the bright sphere from 13 days earlier had emerged from the lake.  \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":59813,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9182508,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09142014-0005","longitude":-94.3784624,"occurred":1410591120000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1410683200000,"summary":"Meteor-like light that hived off into four objects","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files/59813_submitter_file1__MeteorhivingintoTreetops.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/59813_submitter_file2__BlueSpringsLakeareacrop.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Lee's Summit, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:104886"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Pataskala","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving west on route 70 between the flying j and pataskala exit, it was very dark as there are no streetlights here. i noticed a falling object that started directly above and in front of me - very high up and it fell at a constant rate and did not leave a trail or fade but rather slowed, changed direction toward the west and then disappeared all in one impossibly smooth motion.\r\n\r\ni have seen hundreds of meteorites and even a flaming asteroid but never something that moved like this, it was exactly like the x-files so i'm calling it a ufo.

flying up from behind the roof of the apartment building across the street from our balcony to the south. i caught movement out of the corner of my eye, they were very bright and demanded attention. i didn't really know what they could be because they were much larger and brighter than aircraft lights. there were about 6-7 lights in an upside down 'check' formation. they were flying at a steady pace from the south, heading north. they were bright orange, with no strobing white, red, or green lights like on most aircraft. there was no discernible sound either, and we can normally hear planes and helicopters flying overhead all the time, even if we can't see them. so to see something this bright and close with no sound was strange. directly behind the check formation came two more lights, not following each other, buy not exactly side by side either. and then finally one last pair closer together. they all traveled the same speed, the same direction, and with no sound. they looked very bright in the night sky, brighter than headlights even. they disappeared behind a large tree next to our balcony and i was unable to get outside to catch them out our front door. the videos are admittedly poor, shot through our screen door, with an ipad. the second is slightly better though. i wasn't fast enough to catch the initial formation though, just the two pairs that followed.\r\nwe really couldn't believe what we had seen, i've always believed in the potential for alien life but have remained pragmatic about it, if i've seen something silver in the sky i just assume it's a plane i can't quite make out clearly. but these lights i just can't explain. didn't look like search lights from helicopters, didn't look like aircraft lights, or meteors. i honestly can't explain it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
