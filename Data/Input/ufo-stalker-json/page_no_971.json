a darker color than the obvious reflection of the sun.  that reflection is what initially caught my eye.\r\n\r\nat this point, i decided to get more comfortable in my chair and briefly sat back, without looking through the binoculars, and then attempted to resume viewing the object.  unfortunately, the object had vanished.  i could not locate it and i kept looking and looking and looking in the same area - and then moved around to a wider area, but still, no spinning object.  it was gone.\r\n\r\nthere had been no sound that i could hear.  object might have been at an altitude of commercial aircraft, maybe lower.  i simply don't know.  i do know that it could not be seen without binoculars.  object didn't seem \"huge\" but at that distance, i have no idea as to how large or huge it might have been.\r\n\r\ni don't think this was a man-man object or a drone.  in fact, my area is not known to utilize drones and at that high of an altitude i'm not sure what a drone could be doing.  certainly i would have observed a drone leaving the area or moving about the area, and i didn't.  i've also not heard of drones being round or spherical in shape - and stationary.\r\n\r\nwithin about five minutes or a little more after i could no longer see the spinning object, i heard a helicopter approach from the horizon west travelling to the east.  we have \"life flights\" in this area and i assumed that was what it was.  as the 'copter approached, and it was at a somewhat low altitude, it passed in front of me but not over me.  i had my binocs tracking it as it had approached and noticed that it was passing quite near - but certainly lower than - where the ufo had been.  as the 'copter passed in front of my position i noticed it was not a \"life flight\" or a news station 'copter or a private 'copter.  it was painted in a dark military green with a bit of camo color on its side. \r\n\r\nwe do not have a military base in gainesville.  we do have a military base in jacksonville.  frankly, this is the first time i've ever seen a military helicopter in this area, though of course that doesn't mean that they don't fly over.  to me, it seemed a bit of a coincidence that i saw this unusual object and then five minutes later a military helicopter flew in the same area (but lower) than the object.\r\n\r\nthe 'copter continued to fly east and then seemed to turn off to the north.  i heard it flying about in that area - we do have an an airport in that direction, so perhaps it landed there or went on to mayport in jacksonville.\r\n\r\ni've never seen a spinning or rotating ufo before (though at my age, i've certainly seen other anomalies in the sky both in gainesville and miami), so i thought i would report my sighting.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":59803,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.6885886,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09132014-0019","longitude":-82.38894619999999,"occurred":1410654600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1410670375000,"summary":"Observed via binoculars a rotating or spinning sphere unseen with naked eye but viewable via binoculars, daylight hours.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"32606","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Gainesville, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:105350"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Montelíbano","country":"Colombia","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was walking to buy something for eat, when the lights out in mi town and i feeld see the sky and this object pass fastly. them it pass, the ligth came. after that my life have a some diferent acts supernatural.

(green then blue and final being red) i hit his pillow again and he woke up. i began to feel embarrassed but asked him if he sees any lights. he said no and i asked again, \"you didn't see any balls of light near the ceiling?\". he said no again. at this time i was still seeing light residue through out my room. i got up, went to the bathroom then went to the kitchen and looked at the time to see if i could take some decongestant. so i took two and went back to bed. i continued with the same dream and woke up often after that but continuing with the same dream each time i fell back to sleep. i saw no one in my room and heard no one in my room. my dog likes to sleep on my side but this night we made him sleep in his bed due to his acting like he was going to throw up. he didn't react to anything either. i seriously want to remain anonymous due to the growing number of my sightings and i don't want to become the towns circus show. about 6 months ago, i woke up with my clothes in an odd position. i felt that someone convinced me to move them. i tried to let it go but then went outside to feed my animals and found my pond was plugged in. i had gone out several times the night before and i know that it wasn't on. even though it seemed crazy, it felt as though someone had come into my room that morning and then sat out on my porch and plugged my waterfall in to let me know that i was not imagining this. even though i couldn't even prove this to myself, i insisted that my husband bring home chain locks, then if someone entered, there would be proof as he would have to tear up the door to get in. nothing else happened till today.  about two years ago, i woke to use the rest room and felt like i had been laying on a machine or strapped to one. i could feel bar like impressions on both shoulders and running down my back in straight lines. they were not visible but felt like they were matching in length and width, feeling like an inch wide and running down to my waist line. i went back to bed and the next morning i could still feel the impressions on my body. i felt that if it was from a dream that after returning to sleep and waking back up that i would not continue feeling them, but i did. so yeah, i'm starting to feel crazy.

as i watched it became evident it was not moving or if it was it was heading directly towards me hiding its direction of movement from me. as i realized it was not going to \"blink out\" like i tough it should i ran and got my wife paula to see it to. we both watched it for a minute or two as it slowly got dimmer and them faded out. we congratulated  ourselves for seeing what we thought was a one and done event. my wife went back inside and i stepped back outside to look once more at the sky to reflect upon what we had just seen when what to my utter astonishment was to see the exact same object rising vertically into the night sky this time more to the east. as it rose i ran inside to get my wife! \"its back\"!! i shouted, and we both ran out side to see it again!! i simply could not believe it had returned! meteorites don't come back up in the air once they've fallen! what they hell is this we are seeing?? as we stared i ran inside and got my binoculars and ran back out. my wife was shooting video with my cell phone by now. as i looked at the object it moved erratically and was hard to fix on. at the very best i could only see what looked like a perfect round sphere of glowing light. i could not see a structured craft just the light. it was bright red with a glowing orange-ish halo to it. as we watched it, it moved around what looked like miles in the sky jumping form one point to another to quick to be seen then zooming along very fast covering greater distances in less time than any or the airplanes we watched after each sighting to compare their speed to what we saw and the planes were all slower and and straight flight paths. the red orb seamed to have no flight path until the last sighting. on this second sighting the orb faded out the very same way we first saw it do. now we are mystified will we see it again? after about 5min or so again it appeared low on the horizon moving straight up starting out small and growing in size. this time we had our camera on a tripod and we where still not ready for seeing the orb. this time it moved back and for up and down in a lurching motion. then it started moving north until like the first two times it jut faded lower and lower until it blinked out. after that it never returned. we came inside to review what we saw. i think if it was not a military drone then it is a genuine u.F.O. but i question the distances we saw it travel dozens of miles across the sky in the time it take to snap your fingers. none of the planes i've seen can move as fast as this object did. it made right angle moves while zigzagging back and forth and an odd bobbing or lurching motion.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"09:35:09","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":59786,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.54230786168275,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09132014-0002","longitude":-121.84999196646915,"occurred":1410505200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1410600443000,"summary":"Seen a red orb ufo over the mountains near fall city wa","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files/59786_submitter_file1__DSCN0649.MOV"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"98024","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Fall City, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:105366"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Seattle","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While looking for the northern lights, i observed a flotilla of at least thirteen craft, they were very dim. i watched them for about 10 minutes, they were like a flock of birds playing in the sky. they would change the direction and there formation(s). they just kept getting dimer and dimer into the night sky, and then just faded away. i hope others have seen this and reported it also..
