orbs, only spaceships.  these were orbs, i think, not what i ususally experience.  i first noticed the object before dinner, but i just blew it off.  we had dinner on the beach, overlooking the water.  my wife noticed it after dinner, when we went to leave.  i immediately saw a large bright light again, much brighter than the first time, approximately 45 earlier.  i knew immediately what it was, a ufo.  we just purchased a camera a few days before, and we went to the waters edge, and started filming.  my wife did.  the object...There were 4-5 of them, were extremely bright, varieng in size from a pin head to a quarter.  i estimate about half a mile to a mile away from shoreline.  they moved independently, and went from bright small in size, to immensely bright and huge, maybe the size of a quarter.  they moved up and down, remained stationary, and one of them went over land when big, over i would assume sandy hook area, 10-15 miles north of where we were.  there were 6-7 people on the beach watching and filming as well.  it was amazing to see.  my feelings...Very excited, very controlled.  i wanted to attract them, and stood in the light than ran across the water and did jumping jacks to attract it.  it did not respond.  the objects got extremely big and bright maybe 3-4 times.  these actions unfortunatlely were not captured on video of photos. i told my wife to take video, to make sure we had it on video.  i spoke to my cousin on the cell phone throughout part of the experience, because he knows of all the things i have experienced, and i was describing the scene to him as it happened. i am very lucky to have experienced what i have throughout my life.  we never lost sight of the objects.  we left after about an hour or so. i have digital video, audio, and photo.  when i enlarged the photo, you see amazing detail of 2 orbs around a tremoundous bright round light, sometimes two bright circles of light.  unfortunately, i do not know how to submit this to you right now, but will have my wife do so in the next few days to a week.  you will be amazed, or maybe not, since this is probably common.  but it is amazing, and i would like an explanation as to what this is...I believe it is extra terrestrial.  my wife thinks it was secret military craft, but she also said she did not know what it was. she does not believe in ufo, since she has never seen one, but then, she could not explain what we saw and filmed.

after making my delivery and when i got about 2 miles outside of asheboro, nc on i-73, i-74, i saw something i hadn't seen before and i make this trip every day. i looked to my left about 2 or 3 miles ahead (it was dark) and there are some power poles/towers  together that have some white lights going up the sides of them. they are not the tallest towers around, because there are a bunch of them around the few mile stretch of road, but those two are the closet two that are together.  as i got closer i noticed the color turquoise was illuminating from between the two towers. the closer i got the more distinguished it became and at 1st i thought it had to be a blimp. but then i realized it wasn't big enough. it was about half the size of a blimp. i kept looking for some kind of support under it like posts or metal legs holding it up and then i thought it must be a water tower they just put up, but i saw none when i got closer and it actually moved just a bit. i noticed as i got closer it had a string red lights all the way around it protruding like saturn’s halo but i think was attached. when i got as close as i could, which was about probably a ¼- ½ mile to my left off through the woods, i saw it the best i could. it was the shape of a sphere. almost like you would see in a cheesy sci fi movie form the 50’s. illuminated in turquoise with the red lights going around it.\r\nit was actually chaos on the road as others saw it and were struggling to continues to drive straight as they tried to make out what they saw. i thought i’d be side swiped, the only thing that saved it from happening was there wasn’t very many cars on the road…i saw 2 cars pull over, but i was afraid to, because i feared someone would ass end me looking at the site as opposed to seeing me on the shoulder, so i reached for my iphone to take a pic/video and struggled to get it on and just as i held it up, the damn trees blocked my view. so i drove real slow for the next mile hoping to get a break in the trees as everybody else did as well. the speed limit is 65 there and everybody was doing 40. i took my exit about a mile later to go off on the split where i-74 leaves i-73 and hoped to get to an elevated spot where i could still see it. finally as i began to give up i looked back and turned my neck as far as i could and i saw it! it had taken off and was headed due west (i was headed north) and it had climbed high in a short amount of time, and it looked like a green airliner disappearing in the night sky. in about 3 minutes or so approx, i saw what appeared to be an air force jet go by high in the sky in that direction. i also saw about 6-7 nc state police doing about 100 mph headed south toward where i just came from.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

bikes/ped that circles the old dump in american canyon. i checked my watch at 5:55 (4min fast)... i looked up from my watch at the moon, clear sky - no prominent clouds or features caught my attention - and for various reasons i try to pay attention to the sky. i look at the watch, look at the moon, get my coat on and take my hairtie off - look back toward the moon in the west and there is a very odd cloud in the sky.\r\n\"comet?\" was my first thought. \"but no comets have been forecast\"\r\nthe shape of the cloud is what made me think this... but right away there was a obvious issue with any comet hypothesis... the cloud was in a circular formation. i wasn't sure what i was seeing.\r\ni was alone, so i gave it my undivided attention.\r\n i pulled my phone ding the best i could to not take my eyes off the scene- but my camera on my s3 wouldnt pick up anything in the low light.\r\nwhatever it was it was picture worthy for sure.\r\n\r\nhand open at arms length, the cloud appeared to be that size, in a 8o'clock to 3 o'clock clockwise swirl, starting diffuse and broadened at the 8 position, more or less tightening into the \"comet\"- 12 to 3 segment, with a very luminous cloud of water(like)vapor, to the glowing bright \"starlike\" point of light at the head of the \"comet\" (3 o'clock).\r\nwish i had a picture but, hope that helps.\r\n\r\nright away my impression was that this was a static formation.\r\nno visible changes right away. i stood there watching for 15 - 20 seconds before i noticed any change in the scene. the point of light at the nose of the comet moved slowly out of the \"nose\" - leaving a \"horn\" or a pointed trail of cloud as it moved - until it was well apart from the cloud.\r\nthe \"object\" that moved slowly out of the cloud on a linear trajectory grew dim until it seemed to be stationary again at the brightness of nearby stars - some one finger width away from the cloud where it made its exit.\r\n\r\nit could've been a man made rocket or something, i have never seen anything like it, but i also have never seen a space flight. just the thought that this could be some project of ours makes me feel like a moron for writing all of this. there have been folks i have ultimate trust in who say that they have witnessed rockets or missiles flying into orbit from the bay area....\r\n\r\n[item moved/cms/nd]\r\n\r\nit would be cool to get a look at some photos if there are any- \"sunol\" describes something like what i saw with some mention of \"shadows\" and \"craft\"... while i only saw a light.\r\n\r\nanyway... hope this

(i know the exact time because i shot a video with my phone, but unfortunately the quality is too poor to post or show proof.  it just looks like small blurry pin dots of light in the video), i noticed approximately 12-15 orange/red fireball orbs coming up the coast from the south.  my immediate thought was someone set off chinese lanterns from some type of ceremony.  however, they were moving much too fast for a chinese lantern in the wind, and the wind was blowing in an easterly direction while the objects made a very clear and lengthy path from south to north before turning east out towards sea.  the objects were in a loose group and not a patterned formation.  they moved from the south, up the coast line.  before reaching my location, the objects turned from their northern direction and headed east out to sea.  the objects made no noise and disappeared as they headed east and appeared to increase in elevation.  approximately 10-15 minutes later another identical fireball too a similar flight path by itself.  and then another 10-15 minutes later, a second individual identical fireball orb made a similar flight path.  others on the beach witnessed this occurrence and i spoke to some of them asking what they thought it was.  nobody knew, and everyone agreed it was strange.  it was a mostly clear night with a few clouds and the moon is close to full.  the objects all appeared to move in a fluid motion.  there was no starting, stopping or apparent change in speed.  there were a few planes around the area, but it was very evident that they were planes with their red and green lights and noise.  these objects appeared larger than the planes and as significantly brighter glowing orange/red fireball orbs with no distinct shape, design or sound from my vantage point.
