wasted my time, but i'm sure it's ok now :)\r\n\r\ni can't remember too well the exact time of the event, i'm 39 now, but it happened when i was in my mid-teens, probably about 15, on broad street, surrey, between the roundabout where the aldershot road and rydes hill road meet, and wood street village.\r\n\r\ni was cycling to my morning paper round, early on, it was still dark. about 5-5:30 am would be about the time.\r\n\r\ni noticed as i got onto the straight stretch of broad street, that there was an oval, bright white light, about 40ft wide by 10-15ft high ahead and above me. it was swinging from side to side, as if on a pendulum, and totally silent. i immediately thought ufo! cool! \r\n\r\nas i continued cycling (all the houses along the street had their lights out, so i guess everyone was asleep - most people were at that time of morning) the ufo? began to communicate with me, telepathically... the thing is, the communication did not have any emotion, no positivity, no negativity, no urgency, no disdain, no happiness, no sadness, nothing like that at all, it was perfectly neutral, i'd never had anything like this before (and never experienced telepathy before) i tried projecting back communication with my mind, and we had a conversation. unfortunately i cannot remember the conversation (i'd really like to, trust me!) this lasted about 5 minutes, until i got near to the base of the hill climbing to wood street village itself... i had the suspicion that i had been found by aliens, as i was ahead of everyone else at school, and picked up on anything i was taught very readily, maybe that's just big headed, but i was regarded as a child genius. \r\n\r\nthen the ufo asked me if i'd like to come onboard (again with telepathy) i'd been having a calm conversation with it, as it kept pace with me, moving along at my speed, ahead and above of me, swinging from left to right, on an invisible pendulum, silently for about 5 minutes. my initial reacion was \"yes yes of course!\" and i got the sense i would get a free ride and see things i'd never seen before! but then i panicked! - i might never see my mum and dad, my sister, my cat, my friends, planet earth, anything i knew, ever again, so i screamed back telepathically - \"no no no ! wait, let me think, no ! wait, i don't know!\" or something along those lines!\r\n\r\nit was at this point that i lost track of the ufo as i entered the trees and had to climb to the top of the hill. about a minute later (i was a very fit cyclist in my youth, not anymore!) i got to the top of the hill. i looked south, towards normandy way. i saw the ufo, bright as anything in the still black early morning sky, and it had moved a good 2-3 miles, totally silently. it was now stationary a few miles away, still lowish to the ground.\r\n\r\ni told my dad, a retired aeronautical engineer about my siting, and he said it was not a ufo, it was just a helicopter, and i only thought it was so low, because of the effect of parallax error. but i don't believe this, nothing man made could travel 3 miles silently in a minute. \r\n\r\nthis is verbatim, to the best of my memory, and i will swear on my life that it actually happened. \r\n\r\nwhether or not it was aliens, i have no clue. i'd like to think it was though.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, Over 1

look.He also said that it was moving.It started moving in a straight path.It was just looking like a star but shining more brighter white than any other star.Then i gave a thought that , it might be seemed moving as earth rotates but than i realized that earth dose not rotates that fast as it was moving,and even no other star was moving.So,it was clear for me that it is not a star,but it looked just like a star.It was shining white brightly. it even did not made any sound while flying. its shape,body or any other features were not able to get identified as it was shining bright.Then i thought it could be an airplane but airplane has more lights that keep on pulsating,and that are under its wings,but so such other light could be seen.My friend ignored all this as he is quiet a dumb type of guy,but i could not remove m eye from it.I saw it moving more quick than it was moving initially from when i noticed it moving, and that thing moved from where i first saw it straightly in opposite direction until it became out of my sight.I was bit of confused and excited as just few minutes ago i was watching a star and that star like thing just flew straightly from where i first saw

movement. all of a sudden i see a large cloud that was moving at a steady slow pace. as i was looking at this cloud i realized that it was more of a mist. at the tail end of this object i could see small geometric shapes. at this point there was no sound or light coming from this object. moments after i saw the geometric shapes in the object it stopped moving, a buzzing noise started, and it began to move in my direction. i hurried inside and sat in my room. maybe 10 minutes after i had gotten inside i heard my mother coughing violently, and my dog yelp. i hurried downstairs to wake my mother from a dead sleep... after asking if she was okay, she told me she wasn't coughing and did not hear the dog yelp at the foot of her bed. as i was walking back upstairs i heard one solid tap on my front door. at this time i was sitting in my room. the blinds in my room were up, and my right ear began to hurt a lot (a horrible throbbing pain). as i turn to look out my window i watch an object move very quickly out of sight (my room is on the second floor). also my ear stopped hurting at this point. i decided to call a friend and explain what was happening. obviously he didn't believe me and wanted photo evidence. so i sat back down and waited for anything strange to happen. as my ear started to hurt yet again i quickly got up a took a picture. after i took the picture i tried to send it to my friend, but for some reason my cell phone stopped working along with my wifi. after around 30 minutes all went back to normal... until last night when they came back.","distance":"20 Feet or

ufo related?  my mother and i along with my older sister and little brother were on our way to the store,  we pulled onto the hardtop road and a rain cloud from out of nowhere started to hover over our little vw beetle.  it really bothered me. it started to rain only on our car!  i could clearly see that rain was not falling any where else.  it actually followed our car down the road for approximately 2 miles.  when we rounded a curve it did too,  when we sped up it did to, when we slowed down it did too.  finally we go to the end of the road and made a right and the cloud and rain vanished.    i found it very odd that not one other car was on the road with us that entire time.  it's a small town but not that small, and it was in the middle of the day.  what bothered me too, is that as soon as we turned right and the rain cloud vanished it was if nothing had taken place.\r\n\r\n  i asked my mama for an explanation as to what had just happened to us, and she acted as if it were a normal occurrence.  when i disagreed and said that it was not normal she just stopped talking all together and would not respond to my questions she just stared straight ahead, so did my sister and little brother... they were like in a daze or something, now i'm really freakin out.  once we got to the store they got out of the car and acted as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n i've thought about this a lot and i don't have any answers as to what happened that day. nor have i found any other accounts of something similar happening to someone else, so i thought i would ask you,  is this a normal experience?  does this happen ever so often to a lot of people?\r\n\r\nplease e-mail me back with a reply, as this is very important to me.  thank you in advance for your attention.\r\n\r\n[item moved/cms/nd]\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

ne.  what caught my attention was its appearance which was a very bright, white, fuzzy, elongated shape.  at first, i attributed this to a glint, but as it neared this appearance didn't change.  during its passage, it passed behind several, low, scattered clouds, the bases of which were at 3200 feet (as per the nws).\r\n\r\ndue to its appearance remaining ill-defined, i decided to get a picture of it.  by the time i had the camera out of the truck, turned on and zoomed, the object was nearing a tree in the parking lot, so i was only able to take one shot.  luckily, i captured the object just before it would have been lost behind the tree. as it was, it was just behind the tip of a leaf.  i did not see it emerge from the far side of the tree, but it was receding into the distance and would have likely been very distant at that point.\r\n \r\nthe object followed a straight-line trajectory at an elevation of 25 degrees above the horizon and was not leaving a contrail or any other trail.  it made no sound that i was able to discern.  the object's brightness and appearance were constant until it disappeared from view behind the tree.\r\n \r\nthe camera is an image-stabilized canon power shot a710 with 6x optical zoom.  digital zoom was not selected.  when the image was examined, i saw that the object was just as i had seen it--an elongated, bright white, fuzzy shape.\r\n\r\na subsequent test of the camera photographing an airplane at considerable distance, and in the same frame with a tree 50 feet from the camera, resolved the plane with no problem.  that seems to confirm that the camera was essentially focused at infinity when the exposure was made.  there was no post-processing of the image.\r\n \r\ni later went back and traced the outline of a leaf from the tree which could be used for scaling the object's size if there would be some way to determine its distance or altitude.  as mentioned, the tree was at a distance of 50 feet from where the photo was taken.  based on the total duration of the sighting (50 seconds) and arc through which it was observed (100 degrees), the average angular velocity is 2 degrees per second.\r\n \r\ni have attached the full-frame photo and a cropped zoom done with window's photo viewer.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
