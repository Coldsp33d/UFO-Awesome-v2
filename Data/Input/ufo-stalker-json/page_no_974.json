home at around 11 at night we had no power in town and there was a curfew in place so i wanted to get home in time anyway my dahghter saw something in the air comeing from our left and said daddy what is that i could see in the corner of my eye red lights and said its just an airplane and she said no it isn't,about that time i was exeiting the hwy i had to take a left at the stop sign to go to my house.When i stoped i looked up and it stoped right in front of us about 2 or300ft in the air and just hoverd there;iwas trying to figure out what it was iknow it wasn't a helicopter it didn't make a sound it wasn't a blimp and it wasn't a plane we just stared at it i guess about 5 minutes then it tilted at about45 degree angle toward us then i could see it was a disk with red lights all around it i coudnt belive what i was seeing i watched in disbelief for another 5 minutes or so and it just sat there still at that angle then i started to get a little freaked out and thought it was time to get out of there .So i took a left and went on home i got my daughter to watch it as long as she could see it and it was still hovering in the same position.I didn't sleep that night i know what i saw and told a few people but it seems like nobody wants to belive you so i didn't talk about it anymore but it bugs me and that's why im doing this","distance":"101-500

before i die.  in 1955-56, my family lived on hamilton avenue in wilmington, nc .  i was 5 and 6 years old at this time.  one night, as a special treat, i was allowed to sleep on a \"fainting couch\" (chaise lounge) in our back room where we had our piano.  \r\n\r\nthe room was off the kitchen and had a brick fireplace, and one of the windows was to the left of the fireplace.  the chaise sat slightly to the left of this window.  the window was tall, as this was an old house.  the chimney created an alcove of sorts outside this window.\r\n\r\ni was happily snuggled in with pillow and blanket, when a small flying object appeared at the window.  it was perhaps 25\" - 30\" across.  it was what they call a classic saucer shape, although i didn't know that then.  it had a structure atop the main body of the object, and a 4\" - 6\" band around the perimeter of the main body.  this band was rotating clockwise, and had round lights about the size of car headlights.  i remember white for sure as being one of the lights' colors, and i think also yellow, but am less sure about that.  but there was other colors than white.\r\n\r\nthe dead leaves that i knew to be outside the window were being pulled up in a funnel shaped mass that also rotated clockwise.  i could not see the bottom of this object as it was canted in toward the window.  i was terrified, and had the distinct impression i was being watched.  i don't know how long i observed it before doing the typical kid thing, and pulled my covers over my head.  when i peeked out af  short time later, it was gone.\r\n\r\ni never tell this to anyone, except both my husbands, and i think they think i'm crazy.  just this past year, i finally told my daughter, who is 43 years old.  her immediate reaction was, \"so that's why they were there!\"  \r\n\r\nwhen i asked her what she was talking about, she told me that when we lived on felicita avenue in spring valley, ca (ca. 1978 - 1979), she saw the exact same object hovering outside her bedroom window.  she would have been about 7 or 8 years old.","distance":"20 Feet or

neighbor was sitting out there with a friend, she told me to look up, when i did i saw round flame like object.At first we thought something like a plane was on fire, but it wasn't burning.No smoke.No noise(i would assume a burning plane would make some noise) also, it was not falling.It was moving across the sky pretty slowly.It looked like a burning red-orange ball of fire.This last about 4 minutes.As it moved over our apartment building, my neighbor and i ran through to the other side(3 seconds), we looked and saw it moving up and further away,within a matter 5 seconds it was so far away that anyone who didn't follow it would have thought`bright star`.A few minutes later we noticed to more objects to its right,we thought were stars, but we're changing shape into boomerangs.About twenty minutes later we saw a black helicopter move toward the initial\"fireball\"and pass by it.Then circled about ten minutes later and passed in front of it again.As we are watching, we saw the objects change from, green, to blue, to red, dim out and get very bright again,it continued to that the entire time.The \"fireball\"was next to a star, so we used that as a vantage point.And would see the initial\"fireball\"move up and several minutes later back down again it did this a few times.@10:00pm i and my neighbor and her daughter went inside,i put my little girl to bed, went back outside 15 minutes later.And all three objects were gone, completely cleared out! all that was left was that one star we were using as a vantage point.I called wdrb,wlky,whas news and asked if anyone reported anything,i told them what i saw they said nothing was reported and they were not expecting anything in our skies to be seen with the naked eye.Wdrb actually told me it was the\"super moon\"lol thought that was funny! obviously i know the difference.I wish i would have been able to take a photo or video but i have a very old cell phone, and my neighbor's phone wasn't working right at the time.Any

here is more of what happened to me.. i was 2 miles from home and trying to sleep when i just could not! i heard this low frequency pulsating sound that sounded like haarp or something? she said you just keep tossing and turning  why don't you go home and see you in the morning. i said ok it was then about 12 am. i was nearing the driveway there was super huge lights casting on in the sky about 2x treetop level i looked and seen 3 lights up in a row  but then as i turned in i realized it leveled out and was now a huge triangle with super bright led direct current type lights on each corner. it was too late for me because i had already turned into the driveway did not really know what was going on and at that point i decided to backup floor it and get outta there fast. so i did but then panicked because i thought wait a min. they could possibly abduct or disable vehicle. i had 2 seconds to make decision i dropped the shifter into drive and did 50 towards getting inside. i did not know what to do so i ran into the room where i have tv hooked up to a outdoor camera system installed due to past outdoor theft. not for anything else anyway i for some reason was  very afraid huddled in a corner near the tv waiting to see if the any of the cameras motion sensors went full screen my primary focus was on the side opposite me where the thing was; my main concern were 2 bedroom windows where the craft was now hovering tree top and also the easiest point of entry. the camera sensor went full screen to just what i did not want the 2nd and easiest window/entry point; here a neon green grasshopper had somehow jumped right onto that 3 inch lens maybe it was attracted to the red led lights? and just jumped up there but maybe more? i watched this thing in hd and admired how it had 2 arms 2 legs was kinda built like a human and had a more triangular face with solid black almond shaped eyes as i was watching this the camera went out! i almost pooped! then i heard a fighter jet and seen the lights of the ship pass across the back tree top silent jet close behind. there is more that i would like to say because they did return 3 times but i am afraid to talk the dvr hard drive was destroyed and replaced due to the black heli 20ft from me i did not ask for this. i want nothing with any of whatever.\r\nthanks","distance":"21-100
