hovering and got some shots if the craft. it looked like something out of an old 1950's sci-fi film. it was a disk shaped craft with rounded colored lights that blinked red, green white and blue. i got several photos of it and when i zoomed into the shot the colors were windows with shadows back lit that looked like greys. i was shocked to see this and kept filming with my camera. i had it zoomed 200 focal lengthy but with this camera due to the sensor it makes that distance about to a 300 focal length, the aliens inside had very dark eyes seemed short and had awful posture from what i could see in the one zoomed shot. i believe the light refracted off the craft so i could see them in the shot. they seemed to be facing each other and one looked like it was driving something that looked like a submarine viewfinder or something. i was shocked i even got photos if this when i 10x zoomed into the shot all the other photos are on my camera as well as the videos.  the ufo was very far away so it was tricky to focus but i got some good shots when i had my tripod.\r\nthe ufo itself went from 10 o'clock to about 1o'clock over an hour period.\r\nwas hovering and every time i looked

i even thought maybe they tied strings to them to keep them together but with wind in the sky i don't see them holding position. and, if they were wedding lights, how could two of them move up and down without the other 10 moving out of formation, or even move up and down?

clarkson on 07/13/2014. he contacted me and related this account on the basis that his identity would be protected. i spent substantial time interviewing him and i am convinced that this is a true high strangeness event: highly credible witness reporting an extraordinary aerial vehicle that demonstrated performance characteristics that are either extremely advanced and most probably classified military technology or it is non-human intelligence of unknown origin. further, there is now radar confirmation.\r\n\r\nwitness statement:\r\non july 2, 2014, at approximately 1300 hours, i was on-duty and near the intersection of (location deleted by jc), vancouver, washington.  the weather was warm, with excellent visibility, and a partly cloudy sky.  i was in my vehicle, facing east, toward (deleted).  my window was rolled down, providing me with an unobstructed view of the southern and eastern sky.\r\n i noticed movement in the sky, approximately forty-five degrees above the horizon, to the southeast.  i observed a metallic disc, silver-in-color and circular in shape, moving rapidly across the sky from the south to the northeast.  this movement was from my right to my left.\r\n the object was shiny and glinted in the sun as it moved.  it appeared to be several thousand feet in elevation, and from my perspective, appeared to be the size of a dime held at arms-length.  i heard no sound at all from the object, and there was no contrail.  further, it looked uniformly metallic and circular, with no visible wings, tail, windows, lights, landing gear, or other components of conventional airframes, both rotor and fixed-wing.  it also did not look similar to any unmanned aerial vehicles i have observed.\r\n i observed the object travel up and to my left, which was north/northeast.  i saw it increase in elevation rapidly in a straight line, and it appeared to be travelling faster than any conventional aircraft.  after approximately five seconds, i observed the leading edge of the object shimmer and disappear.  i observed this continue, as an image of the surrounding blue sky enveloped the object, moving in a vertical line across the surface to the rear edge, until the object blended in with the sky behind it.  \r\n as this change occurred, i observed a slight blurriness in the changed areas, inconsistent with the sky behind it.  this distortion was similar to looking at an object immersed in water.  however, once the entire object had changed, this effect stopped and i immediately lost sight of the object.  the time from complete visibility to disappearance was approximately two to three seconds.\r\n at the time of disappearance, the surrounding sky was blue and cloudless.  i continued looking but was unable to find the object.  approximately thirty seconds later, i observed a jet fighter aircraft flying rapidly along the same course the disc had taken.  i recognized this aircraft, based on prior experience, to be an f-15.  i was only able to observe the bottom of the aircraft, and no insignia were visible, but it looked identical to the f-15 fighters based at the portland air national guard base.  \r\n i observed the f-15 follow the same flight path, moving from my right to upper left.  it continued, flying beyond where i had last seen the object, but in the same direction and elevation.  from my perspective, the f-15 was the approximate size of a quarter held at arms-length.  additionally, the f-15 was extremely loud while passing over, whereas the disc was silent.  i observed the f-15 continue to the northeast, out of my line of sight.  \r\n based on my training and experience, this was no known military or civilian aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicle, astronomical phenomenon, balloon, atmospheric effect, or misidentification of a known object.  this object was a real, physical, tangible craft, and it exhibited flight characteristics at least comparable to a military fighter aircraft.  further, the object's ability to adopt complete camouflage, which was capable of effectively mirroring the surrounding environment, is a capability which to my knowledge has not been successfully developed or implemented.  nothing further. \r\nnote: radar data has been obtained and analyzed that confirms this account; i was assisted by  [item moved/cms/nd] . i will be adding his report. also, investigation continues.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

- i could not tell how far away it was.   i asked the others if they thought it was a star, planet or plane, and they thought plane, as 'stars don't twinkle like that'.   it didn't seem to be moving, so i figured it was a plane or helicopter coming towards us, but after several minutes it was still in the same place - it might have moved a bit to the west.   after 5 minutes or so a second, identical light rose up from behind the trees and hovered next to the first one - or at least it seemed to - it might have been farther or closer away.   after another 5 minutes i saw a third light

miss seeing this. over the course of about an hour, the light moved up and down, to the right very quickly. it also disappeared and reappeared changing in size and brightness.  there were two other lights that also appeared but didn't stay long.  i did get a picture of two lights but not all three.\r\n\r\ni tried taking pictures of it with my camera and my iphone.  it is difficult to focus on a ball of light behind a cloud over water in the dark, so the best pictures are where i tried to focus on the reflection it made in the water below.\r\n\r\nit was a very unusual thing to watch.  i have never seen anything quite like it before and doubt i will see anything like it again. the moon was on one side of the house and the lights over the lake were it wasn't the moon that we saw.  the moon
