my area, and other parts of orange county.\r\n\r\nin around 1995 an investigation of these lights were done my mufon of orange county and me for 2 nights.  the objects observed went into mufon's records as 'unknown' that years later jan harzan (now director of mufon) told me 'unknown' means ufo.\r\n\r\nit is now 2014, and i still see those lights with eyewitnesses.\r\n\r\nthey are the size of an aspirin, and blink and flash.  years ago they appeared in all directions coming in at 2 at a time about every 20 seconds.  recently i observed them for around 40 minutes, so i do not know, at this time, how long they appear.  one's sighted time is usually around one minute.  they appear and disappear seemingly from nowhere.  sometimes one or two nearby each other take on the size of a basketball.  they are reddish, and appear less than a hundred feet high.  for the past couple of years, at least, i seen them only in one area over a main street.\r\n\r\nobserving the lights from ihop restaurant i was sitting on a planter with a 2 foot square window behind me.  as i was observing one or two of the lights i started hearing loud knocking on the window 2 feet away from me.  i assumed it was one of my friends who worked there, so i put up my hand and wiggled my fingers.  but when the knocking kept up i turned around, and saw nobody there.  as i was looking at the window the knocking continued. and it continued for about a full minute after i looked straight back at the lights.  the knocking on the window sounded like it was coming from the inside of the restaurant.\r\n\r\nover the years i have been trying to figure out what those lights were, as i photographed and filmed them.  now i presume they are nuclear powered propulsion systems that accompany invisible spacecraft with invisible occupants.  thank you.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet,

was coming from the east, kinda floating. my first thought was to pull out my camera but i just had to focus on it and didn't feel the need to video it. at first i thought it might be a mylar balloon, but then it came down real close. it was a brilliant white aura and all i could see were some slight dark vertical lines within the aura. the only thing i could think to relate it to would be like the shape of a hockey puck. it was so close and so brilliant it was hard to make out anything but the light,the lines were the only thing i could see to give it any kind of shape. it came in from the east almost floating like a feather, except the wind was from the south. it then started heading north along the ridge, i started to follow it then thought, \" i can't chase this thing\" so i stopped.I put my hands down to my side, and thought,\"what? i'm here, talk to me\". i showed no fear or aggression. then it was as if it stopped to look at me. i saw and felt this web of energy come from it. it looked like lines of electrical energy connected together to form a web, like the lay lines of the earth. it felt like some kind of scanner, like it was collecting information. i actually felt a connection to it. when it left i saw a small zig-zag then i saw a small flash of orange and it was gone in a split second.                 \r\n    \r\n   i also saw a ufo up in meadview a few years

liner passed over the formation during the sighting; the air liner was closer in our field of vision; the jet liner was dwarfed in comparison to this formation. i distinctly remember feeling nauseous

avenue which becomes maryland's hwy 4. which is where i was when my daughter, who is 10 years old and quite bright, and i noticed the object straight in front of us but off to the left a bit.  i at first thought it was a plane, as this is very close to andrews afb, but as we got closer, it had an odd almost triangular shape with some sort of rounded compartment at top center.  we are quite used to the planes buzzing everywhere, what struck us about this object was that it was just sitting there in the air above the trees.  we saw no exhaust or fumes or propellers.  i have no idea how this object was actually flying.  we continued to observe it as we drove toward it on a straight portion of the road until finally we passed it and could no longer see it.  the whole 15 minutes or so that we observed the object, it never moved, made a sound, flashed a light, nothing.  it just hung there in space looking very odd and out of place.  there were no markings, flags, symbols or insignia of any kind painted onto the exterior of the craft, it was just covered in a dark smoky gray paint. that's all we recall at this time.\r\n\r\nthe experience was disturbing enough to bring me here and to try to see if anyone else reported the object we saw.  i've never seen anything close to a ufo before, and maybe i still haven't, but after a lifetime lived on military bases with planes flying almost constantly, i can honestly say i've never seen anything like that before.  the only thing close to that hovering capability would be a helicopter, and this was in no way a helicopter.  as i said before, there were no rotors visible, no propellers, no propulsion device visible at all.  it just left both my daughter and me with a very odd feeling and a question we couldn't answer, which is

bright glowing orb in the northwestern sky.  at first, i thought it might be a lantern, but it seemed to move exceedingly fast, faster than even a plane or jet would appear to move across the sky, yet it made no sound. i was amazed to see how fast it moved.  i had never seen anything like it before. its glow pulsated or flickered, but randomly, not like aircraft lights.  this may have been related to the atmosphere, as the stars were flickering in the same manner.  it was difficult to estimate its size or altitude.  i could see its shape plainly, so it seemed closer than aircraft fly, but it may have been a larger object farther away. i watched it pass behind the neighbor's house.  i moved to the backyard and saw it again on the same path traveling from north to south. it did not deviate from its course. it did not speed up or slow down. there was a faint white glow around the orb. i went inside to tell my wife to look out our southern facing window, but it had disappeared. it had covered the distance in a matter of about 1 minute. i was explaining what had happened to my wife when she said that she saw something out the window too.  this was about 5 minutes after i sighted the first object. when i looked, i could see the same or a second, similar object.  it had the same appearance and was traveling on the same path, but it appeared to either be smaller or further away.  i grabbed binoculars, but it was far away and i couldn't make out any more details.  it passed behind a tree and flickered more before fading out.  at the end, it appeared to fall toward the ground and flicker out. it was visualized for about 45 seconds.   the temperature was 64 degrees, skies were clear, winds were light out of the north. the moon was a nearly full in the southern sky. \r\n\r\ni know this was not a meteor because it was too slow and steady. it did not appear to be a traditional aircraft because of its shape and speed and lack of standard lights and sound. my best guess is that it could be a lantern, because of its glow and lack of noise and the appearance that it may have burned out at the end.  however, it was moving very fast.  i wouldn't think a lantern could move that fast unless the upper level winds were much faster than those at the surface.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

look up at the sky just as i was about to arrive home. i observed 4 large, apparently low-flying, pulsating, glowing red orbs with orange highlights flying in formation. they were traveling from e to

existence.\r\n\r\nthree of the orbs formed a perfect triangle while the 4th was trailing slightly behind the \"rear lh\" corner of the triangle. the distances between the 3 points of the triangles were equidistant while the \"straggler\" was closer (about half the distance between the others). they made no noise.\r\n\r\ni am an amateur astronomer who lives near an airport so i see all manner of planes, satellites, etc. i have never seen anything like this and cannot even begin to explain what it was. if i was observing a solid craft with lights (although there was no indication that it was such) it must have been massive. a city block wide and at least twice as long.\r\n\r\nnot more than a minute after the orbs simply vanished right before my eyes, a small commercial plane flew by just to the south of the orb's flight path but in a w to e direction. whatever these orbs were would have been just head of and to the left of the cockpit and i find it impossible that the crew of that

observing me through my window. my cousin was there with me and she saw it too. when we ran to the front door to go outside a bright bluish white light lighted up the whole house and it was gone. this happend like around 2000-2004 cant recall exact date. no one believed us. it was a disc as big a a regular bedroom and it was slanted over my neighbors roof but really close to my window, directly at my window and it was just hovering there turning slowly, had round windows red and green, red and green all around.\r\n\r\nthen after that i kept seeing weird white lights in my bedroom and sometimes i would hear someone calling me and no one would be home just me.\r\n\r\nthen when i moved to san antonio i still kept seeing white orbs here and there in my new home with my parents.\r\n\r\nthen i moved to poteet last year.\r\ni stoped seeing the orbs.\r\nbut on july 4rth of this year i was outside alone inside my mini van listening to music. my cat tagged along and was inside with me. i had my windows down and i turned the light on from the inside of the van. i was taking pictures of my cat whom was acting silly. then all of a sudden my phone froze and i wasn't able to scroll through it, then it blacked out, and i thought the battery had run down but then it turned back on on its own and i saw that it still had enough battery so i thought that was strange. i also had a strange feeling like if someone was watching me but i felt brave because my cat was with me so i didn't feel completely alone.\r\nit marked 3:13 am on my van's clock but on my cell phone it marked 3:15am when i decided to keep taking pictures of my cat right after my phone had turned back on... so i took like 3 pictures of my cat repeatedly to try to capture a good pic of him. \r\nwhen all of a sudden i noticed something on one of the pictures... it looked like a face but i didn't want to freak my self out so i didn't even stare at it for long i just turned off my car and went inside.\r\ni felt scared, i felt like something was watching me.\r\n\r\nthen... friday aug 29th around 3 am i can't quite remember how things happend that night.\r\ni don't know if i had a dream or if it was real because it felt real\r\nany who this is what i dreamed or so i think i dreamed.\r\ni heard a noise and i went to my kids room and checked them out then i went outside and circled around my trailer home. \r\nwhen i was infront of my trailer home i noticed that there was something in the sky and it was approaching me. it was a round black ball, no lights... i freaked out and as i turned around to run inside all of a sudden i felt a light carry me off my feet. i was trying to move to try to get out of that light and i couldn't, i kept feeling like it was taking me up. it was like a reddish bluish kinda transparent streaks of light but i couldn't see that well through it... then after that i can't remember a thing except remembering waking up on my sons bed with a grey alien ontop of me. i wasn't scared, i felt anger and i manged to get my arms out of his restrain and i quickly tried to slap him, i don't know if i hit him but he was able to restrain me again and he gaved me a look, an emotionless look and that's all i can remember after that, his face, his round black eyes and his little nose and mouth... it was scary \r\nthen that whole weekend i couldn't stop thinking of his face

begin to move south, it had a reddish tint at first until it got closer to the middle of the sky. it flashed randomly as if reflecting the sun, there was a short white line that came out and moved in and out around the object. i watched it as it got more distant and faint, eventually i stopped watching it. i saw two more which were similar, except one of them seemed higher so i didn't see the line coming out of it. then i saw a fourth one, by this time i had gotten my telescope. its not a very good one but i was able to see the shape of the object very well. at first it looked like a crecent, but then i realized the crescent shape was wings and there was a small dot on the bottom that resembled a tail, there was no head but there was an outline of what looked like a body. the object didn't move like a bird, it wasn't going in the right direction for the position of the wings, it was traveling very slowly across the sky and it was spiraling slowly, but its wings didn't flap at all, it was spiraling like a leaf in the wind or like a plane spinning on its side. it neither looked like a plane or a bird though as it was so high up i needed a telescope to see it properly. all the sightings took place between 1:08 pm and roughly 1:30 pm. if someone gets back to be via email i will send a drawing outline of what i saw. i haven't had time to scan a drawing yet because i really wanted to report it first but if someone can reply to be about this i can send a picture. i tried taking a picture of it with my camera but it didn't come out.\r\n\r\ni also recorded the event with a voice recorder but that isn't any different from what i have written here.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

work at. it appeared to be the size of a commerical airplane possibly a bit larger, however the video i have is very breif and requires frame by frame viewing on a computer, but the object is detiled and clear using these methods. after viewing the video i \"think\" that when viewing frame by frame you can see other circlular grey in color shapes moving about. the video is breif due to the fact that i was driving at the time. i have more footage of different shaped craft as well but this is the first time ever speaking publicly about these sightings, i would just like to get more information as to what is going on in our skies. i would appreciate any thoughts into what i have sent. thank you for your time in advance.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
