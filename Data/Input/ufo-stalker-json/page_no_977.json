greensboro, nc, near-north part of town [about a half mile from friendly shopping center; light pollution not an issue].  the sky was relatively clear in the west, where i observed what at first i thought was a star roughly 20 degrees off the western horizon, due west.  i am a stargazer and have even had an astronomy course or two...  simply to say i'm fairly familiar with the better-known cataloged heavenly objects.  this \"star\" was stationary and about the size of sirius, but the coloration was wrong, and the quality of the light was .. unusual.  i pointed this out to my friend, and we observed it for about 20-25 minutes.  \r\n     the \"star\" was white, slightly toward yellow.  rather than the blue-white one sees around sirius, this one had a dominant red-flash pattern.  there was the slightest hint of yellow-orange-to-red starting at the edge of the white core to the clearly red beams, as well as a softer blue that i could only barely see, but my friend definitely saw the blue.  also, the blue wasn't just star beams flashing; it also seemed to be more \"around\" the object, quite dull compared to the red beams.\r\n     the quality of light is what first captivated me and was also commented on by my friend.  where one might describe sirius as kind of \"sharp\" in its ambient appearance, this was quite bright like sirius, but softer; yet the scintillating beams, such as one observes around sirius or any star, were strong.  for the most part during our watching it, it appeared to be unobscured, but during the last few minutes, it seemed to dim, suggesting cloud wisps, but was never entirely out of sight.\r\n     an intriguing incident occurred when the flashing red light of what may have been a small airplane flew, in relation to our observation point, toward the star-like object, at an angle from about 7-2 o'clock.  then from �gan inch or so out�h clearly it seemed to fly around the ufo as if to avoid it, from about 9 o�fclock to 12 o�fclock, at which point it abruptly changed its flight pattern again and flew upward as if continuing its original trajectory as observed.  if the ufo object is the middle of the clock hypothetically, then the small plane [light] was first noticed at about 7 o�fclock.  once it partially circumvented the considerably larger object to a little past 12 o�fclock, it abruptly continued its upper-angled path from, we can say, 7 o�fclock to [1.30-] 2 o�fclock.\r\n     over the 20 or so minutes we observed it, although it appeared to be stationary like a star, it seemed to drift a bit northward and also appeared to be moving toward the western horizon in the way of stars, etc. setting.  \r\n     when it became dimmed by cloud wisps, and since nothing else was happening, we quit observing.  i have been trying to learn where sirius was during that time, which am fairly sure had not yet risen into visibility in this part of the world yet, but i am very sure this was not sirius.  also it was not jupiter or saturn -- the typical scintillating star beam phenomena were strikingly evident.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":59614,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.7595731,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09062014-0009","longitude":-79.01929969999999,"occurred":1409977800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

due east), i noticed how cloudless the sky was and how dynamicly the stars appeared in orion & between that constellation and jupiter.\r\n\r\nthis is a residential suburban neighborhood. after gazing upon sirius because it was so clear and twinkling from blues and purples to whites and greens, i looked over to jupiter (slightly more ne of the constellation).\r\n\r\nupon looking at jupiter, i saw an extremly bright white/green \"star\" at jupiter's 1-2o'clock position (if you will). because i never recalled seeing a heavenly body that dynamic or bright near jupiter before, and knowing that powerlines could easily obscure my view, i walked down the drive more to see the sky beyond the cables.\r\n\r\nthe white/green light then flashed again, proving that i did see a flash and wasn't getting confused by the powerlines. this time the flash was slightly less large and seemed to be an aircraft headed due east.\r\n\r\ni waited for another flash of bright light, as i see planes and heliocopters often in the sky being near piedmont triad airport in greensboro, nc. however: i heard no sounds of an engine or propulsion. the light from this \"plane\" was not constant with a red and green starboard/port indication.\r\n\r\nthis light in the sky grew brighter and faded with the deliberate and speed of a lighthouse beacon that brightens and fades as it spins. i was able to see three or four of these cycles as it appeared to head east quickly (i say quickly because after the deliberate cycles from bright to dim, the object was gone from view... seemingly growing smaller as it headed east)\r\n\r\ni know what i saw was not typical. i have seen planes and other aircraft at night having grown up outside of newark airport in nj. i have also been lucky enough to have seen the mir space station as it entered the atmosphere near greensboro at about 3:15 am on my way to work years ago. this object faded and brightened to the same white/green color i found unique about

up at my apartment. he was trying to sleep with me. he knocked on my door and generally fumbled around loudly in the apartment hallway while calling me and trying to get me out of bed. i turned my phone off and lay there. i heard him laugh and there was a strange power tool noise but the door was deadbolted and i did not answer. i am pretty sure he was drunk. he must have woke the neighbors because i heard them move around and water sounds like people using the bathroom. this building is a quadplex and late at night if the air isn't on you can hear sounds. i was a little embarrassed and annoyed so it took me a bit to fallback asleep after he left. that is where i get the timeframe for the occurance. i fell back asleep and at some point i heard a noise at the front door and i woke up enough to think oh, he's back. it sounded like the front door opened and i lay there, feeling something approach my bed. it felt like something leaning over me in the dark and i tried to move but i couldn't. i tried to say help me and i actually did manage a help me with a lot of difficulty. that is different from my other bouts of sleep paralysis. i heard a loud rumbling noise rush at the head of my bed. it sounded a lot like a movie explosion. i couldn't move and i had the thought, oh. i'm going to die. then all the sudden i could move but it was more like i turned on. my heart stuttered into fear and i lay there pretty creeped out. by tuesday i realized part of my bike had been stolen. i had run to work on monday so i didn't notice my bicycle damage. tuesday morning i went outside to unlock my bike and the back tire was missing with the lock attached to the front (dumb me, i know). weird about it is that it was locked under my garage window which was opened. inside my garage is a television and two very nice unlocked bikes. i guess i'm confused why they walked off with my tire. there were also several adult bikes laying around the yard from kids and they weren't locked. i reported it to the police. not the sleep paralysis. not my coworker, either. i don't think someone trying to sleep with me would try and steal my property. plus, i've had other strange theft events lately. i also discovered that same day i reported to the police there was a package delivered that wasn't there. it was a grocery store box and wasn't worth much. but a few days earlier a package disappeared being delivered from a different postal service that never made it past ohio. i used online package tracking and it just disappeared and had to be re delivered. i'm pretty sure the fbi is here or some group is with me. maybe because 9/11 is like sweeps week with me. i was texting that same co worker yesterday and something interesting occurred. he said, yelp. i said if he was making dog noises at me that i prefer bow wow. a few minutes later a man in a truck drove by me walking and said out his open window, woof woof. he had a serious look on his face and i'm guessing he wasn't making an expression about my looks. he looked a little old for that. as a little history i was pregnant with my first son on 9/11 at fifteen which is legally rape and never prosecuted. my 2nd son was born on mother's day which is the anniversary of my first baptism. the day of my 2nd baptism the lottery numbers came up 9911, that is the daily four. i baptized into the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and 9/11 is a date of significance in that church as well as a historic event and the day i gave birth to my rape baby as a teenager. 9/11 is a really big deal so i'm not surprised i have a little company this week. i wish they would just stop and shake my hand and say hello. say something like, hi karen. we are here for observation (or whatever). don't be alarmed if you see us hanging around. for starters i could at least not embarrass myself or be unintentionally rude. sometimes i feel like a caged animal or poked at (not literally). when they do stuff like drive by's it really makes me agitated and upset. it makes me hostile because i am a rape victim and so sorry someone wants to make signs at you through me. it makes me feel like i'm in trouble and i might be prosecuted for giving birth or something. it pisses me off. it scares me and i have been having anxiety attacks since that day and i'm really angry at my co worker and really, even my whole company i'm employed with right now. i just feel agitated and depressed. i do report things to the fbi because i have had many conversations with muslims over the years through chat rooms and these are people who represent they are from overseas. this was after 9/11 and i'm not sure as to the validity of claims to who they are but because of unusual events it seems safer to just let someone know. i would be curious if there were any unusual anything else in my area that night. i am only a mile from a small airport also. i may also be unwell but it has been many years since i've had a bout of sleep paralysis. that's all i have. maybe it's stress the sleep paralysis but someone is here with me right now. some

pollution is pretty bad in my neighborhood...) and noticed what i thought was a \"shooting star\", complete with the \"poof\" some of the bigger ones make when first entering the atmosphere, appear near algenib in the constellation of pegasus(about the same altitude, but maybe 3-5 degrees to the left of the star...). at first, the object appeared to be a dull white in color with a matching tail of ~5-7 degrees in length. the object traveled in a northerly direction for ~20 degrees, where the tail faded away and a pinpoint spherical object of orange/yellow remained. this sphere continued towards the constellation cassiopeia. i tried to bring the object into focus with my binoculars, but object would not focus and appeared as a fuzzy orange/yellow orb.\r\n\r\nit was when the object reached cassiopeia that object appeared to \"rebound\" off the star schedar, change color to reddish/orange, and started travelling back towards pegasus.(the 2 lads with me swore that they could now

again changed course and appeared to be descending towards the constellation aquarius. \r\n\r\nwhen object reached the general vicinity of aquarius, the object(which still wouldn't focus through my

the air.  it had a contrast to the sky that really made it stand out compared to any airplane i have seem.  there was absolutely no engine trail either.  i did not think much of it at first, but then i decided to take a picture and video of it.  by that time is was starting to get blocked by the trees at the park.  when i started to record it, that is when it seemed to be changing direction.  after looking at the video, it seemed to also to be descending.  earlier it had just been going in a straight line across the sky.  i eventually lost sight of it because of the trees.  i did not have any particular feeling other than wondering what i saw.  i was not able to judge the distance to the object or the size.  i am thinking it was not too close due to the size.

i was requested by dr. stanton friedman to report this sighting to you. in late july, 1968, my grandfather and grandmother were moving into their new residence on the grounds of the tranquille hospital 6 miles from kamloops, bc, canada. my grandfather was starting his new job as medical superintendent of the tranquille hospital. we spent the day unpacking boxes etc. as it was extremely hot (kamloops can get to over 100 degrees during the summer), we all (my grandparents, my mother and father, myself, and my sister) stepped outside to cool down. the time was approximately 10:45 pm. as we were standing in the garden, i happened to look up to the sw sky. i observed 6 bright star-like objects flying in circles around each other. i pointed the lights out to everyone there, and they saw the lights too. it seemed as though the lights were playing a game of tag in the sky. the 6 lights continued to fly in erratic patterns in one spot in the sky, sometimes changing direction 180 degrees instantly. the size of the area in the sky the lights occupied was about the size of a dinner plate held at arms length. we continued to observe the lights for approximately 10 minutes. after 10 minutes, the lights started slowing down, and eventually formed a stationary circle of 6 lights. the lights remained stationary in the circular pattern for about 15 seconds, then they all flew outwards in 6 different directions so fast, they were gone in less than 1/4 second. i estimate the speed they flew off in the 1000's of mph. my grandmother was a believer in extraterrestrials, and was one of the first subscribers to \"ufo magazine\" in 1967. i asked my grandmother what the lights were, and she immediately said \"oh, those were flying saucers\" the popular term for ufo's in those days. as a person who grew up fascinated by \"the space age\", i thought at the time \"no big deal\". it was like growing up knowing that exotic animals existed in africa but never seeing one, and finally seeing one for the first time in a zoo. i now realize how lucky we all were to have witnessed this amazing occurrence. as a footnote, to this day, tranquille is still a hotspot for ufo sightings. there are large mineral deposits (copper, silver, and gold) in the area, and that may be attracting them to that area.

8:22 cdt (this was the time stamp, on the exif data, though i believe the time is off by about an hour, as i think the moonrise was after 9:00 pm that evening. ) perhaps the camera time is off, and or daylight savings time. \r\n\r\nlocation: duluth, minnesota on great lakes aquarium waterfront balcony overlooking duluth harbor facing approximately south east.  \r\n\r\nweather: fairly pleasant, skies generally clear, with some clouds.\r\n\r\npurpose of photo shoot first sighting: i am a contributor to flickr, having been a member since 2006, i regularly, upload photos of the area, this photo outing, to try and get some photos of the moon rise. as such i had the equipment all preset for such, and on a very sturdy tripod.\r\n\r\ngroup 1 photos (3 of them)\r\n\r\nphoto 1: img_7563.Jpg monday, july 22, 2013 at 8:19 pm focal length 70mm.  \r\nas i was waiting for the moon to rise, i noticed some lights off in the distance in the sky. i focused the camera on the lights, and took a photo. the lcd screen did not give me any indication of detail, so i wasn’t able to fully appreciate what i had captured, until i got home, and viewed on my computer and a 40” samsung un40d6000sf lcd tv that i use as an extended display with my mac. the photo is best appreciated by zooming in, (i’ve included some crops), as the lights were some ways away, though not sure how far. i suppose it could be extrapolated, by the focal length, size of the lights, etc. \r\n\r\nmy frame of mind: a bit of wonder, as to what they could be, they were a bit of a mystery, though at the time, i didn’t draw a conclusion of alien ufo or the like, just a bit of wonder, of what they might be. unusual, and that is why i tried to see what they might be. \r\n\r\n\r\nphoto 2: img_7564.Jpg,  july 22, 2013 at 8:20 pm focal length 70mm\r\nthis one shows, 2 ufo lights, the one dimmer than the other, and upon zooming in, on the lower one, it seems as though a shaded shape is seen. you must zoom in to see the fainter set of lights, (even with the crop).\r\n\r\nphoto 3: img_7565.Jpg, monday, july 22, 2013 at 8:20 pm focal length 70mm\r\nthis photo, shows one lighted ufo, the other one down below, barely noticeable, as a dark unlit blob. \r\n\r\ngroup 2 photos\r\n\r\nphoto 4: img_7566.Jpg, monday, july 22, 2013 at 8:20 pm focal length 70mm\r\nthis one is lower on the horizon, showing 2 different lighted ufo’s, of a slightly different configuration. these are the 2 ufo”s in the movie as well. (img_7569.Mov)\r\n\r\nphoto 5: img_7567.Jpg, july 22, 2013 at 8:20 pm focal length 70mm\r\nthis one showing 2 the different lighted ufo’s, of a slightly different configuration, again. rising in the sky.\r\n\r\nphoto 6: img_7568.Jpg, july 22, 2013 at 8:20 pm focal length 70mm\r\nthis one showing 2 the different lighted ufo’s, of a slightly different configuration, again. rising in the sky.\r\n\r\nphoto 7: img_7569.Mov, july 22, 2013 at 8:22 pm 1920x1080h.264 movie (length 01:06 minutes)\r\n1920x1080p movie showing the group 2 lighted ufo’s, rising in the sky.\r\nthey were rising in the sky, so i thought to switch from photos, to see if i could get a movie of them. the unusual nature of them, now starting to register as something possibly unusual, and a movie may be a good thing to try and get. i eventually lost focus as they were about to go off of the frame, trying to readjust. near the end, you can see an airliner traveling by,  and at the end, due to losing focus, a bug in the near foreground. i muttered something to myself on the soundtrack near the end as well. this is unaltered, as it came from the camera.\r\n\r\nphoto 8: img_7570.Jpg, july 22, 2013 at 8:22 pm focal length 70mm\r\nthis, switching back to photos, group 2 lighted ufo’s, rising in the sky, one dimmed and barely visible.\r\n\r\ni’ve also included img_7562,jpg, showing my location at the back of the great lakes aquarium, taking a test photo of our aerial lift bridge, waiting for the moon rise. this has no ufo interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nsome of the photos are dark initially, (i “stop down” exposure, at times, to enable faster shutter speed), but they do show more detail when zoomed in. i normally upload all my photos into adobe lightroom, and rework as necessary. these are the untouched originals though as downloaded from my camera. \r\n\r\ni decided to upload originals, even though a bit dark, for veracity. i have included cropped copies, to show the center of interest, with some exposure adjustment, that is all, just to lighten them. the exception being img_507 crops, the second sighting photo that i tried to enhance due to them being a bit grainy as the iso was higher. these are better to view and show detail better. i think the best photo is img_7563, the first one, a group 1 photo, as it shows the chain link of lights.\r\n\r\nmy initial experience with showing others photos, is mixed, interesting to see the variety of reactions, you get “the look,” from some people, so i’ve been reticent to show them to some. i did upload them to flickr initially last year, but took them off, getting weird comments and such, and not wanting to turn my artistic photo stream into a side show. i recently renewed my interest in these, and also found some ufo reports from minnesota  the other day, that mentioned “chain of lights,” so with that in mind thought to offer them for what they are worth.\r\n\r\nthanks for your time, and cooperation. hope these can be of use in some way.\r\n\r\ni was not able to upload all the photos as i intended, some of them were crops for easier viewing. i created this report on text edit, planning on being able to copy this and upload all photos. most pertinent information can be gathered from the ones i uploaded.\r\n\r\nkind regards, [name removed/cms/dr]\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":59590,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.78667189999999,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09052014-0010","longitude":-92.1004852,"occurred":1374553200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1409952742000,"summary":"Viewed, photographed, and took movie of 4 ufo's. lights appeared to be in a chain link of sorts.
