go upward at his fence line as to be going up the trees. then it disappeared for a second and then i saw a contained blue ball of light come down and appear to land in the next yard to the north which is vacant but i feel that it disappeared into the ground. i stood there looking for it to reappear but it never did but with buildings and trees in the area, it could have continued it's path without

direction it headed was south. we first spotted it at about 7:25 pm in a store's parking lot. the comet was white and looked an inch wide and several inches long in the sky. during our drive home, he saw it change direction:  it took a sharp, roughly 90 degree turn south. we temporarily lost sight of it because of trees. when we sighted it again three minutes had passed and an orb of light began to luminesce behind it and continued for approximately three seconds until it was as bright as a brilliantly glowing white star. it was so bright my son thought it was a supernova because it was still broad daylight. about ten seconds later it dimmed in the same amount of time as it earlier luminesced. immediately after the light had faded away, my son said that he could just barely make out what appeared to him to be a circular, grey object from which the light came from. as if we weren't amazed enough, a second orb-light appeared in precisely the same manner:  in intensity of light, size, and the amount of time it lasted as the first one. while these events were occurring, one big plane and two small planes were trailing the orbs. while the second light was still glowing, it came perilously  near one of these aircraft, as if curious of its presence, before distancing very fast. at our house, we had a clear final view of the spectacle before it disappeared over the trees. we saw the comet being trailed by the orbs, which were now pulsating white yellow and a steady stream of aircraft following them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

practice run for the cleveland national airshow held over labor day weekend. i went outside to take a look.  i pulled out my phone to get some video of them, as they pass pretty close.  as i faced north waiting for them i noticed an object traveling north to south.  i thought airplane when i first seen it.  i then seen it stop and then continue.  chopper i then thought.  the distance and my eyesight didn't allow for a clear view. the object paused just for a second or two at least a couple of times before i started filming.  i picked up the video about half way of the time i viewed it. unfortunately i didn't know how to zoom in on my newer phone. the video going to the ground at the beginning was my attempt to find the zoom.  the object has a small pause in it's motion near the beginning and a longer pause near the end as it nears the building.  \r\n\r\nthere is no wow factor in this video, nor was i thinking, hey, a ufo.  as i watched it and ruled out airplane and chopper the only shape i could make out was square to rectangle.  the object appeared bigger in person than it does on video.  a drone of some sort was my only other thought but with the distance it traveled north to south a regular quadricopter used for gopro type video wouldn't have that range, i presume. i estimate the travel range that i observed north to south was 3 to 5 miles.\r\n\r\ni stopped filming because of sun glare and assumed it wouldn't show up.  the video is shot facing west.  lakewood is about 5 miles in that direction.  the fact that mufon posted another video of a similar object in the same vicinity is the only reason i am submitting this one.  \r\n\r\nwithin 30 seconds after i stopped filming the object that i can't identify, the blue angels were in my face and i hit record again.  i'm also including this clip so you can verify the time stamps.  i was facing north again but turned east to follow the angels.  the same building is at my back. it wasn't until after i went back inside that i realized a no fly zone was most likely in effect while the blue angels were in the air. \r\n\r\nhere's hoping that you have some video software that may be able to help zoom in without much distortion.  the object appears very small on video and is just left of dead center at the beginning, moving to the left (south) in case your not seeing it. the audio sound is from machinery in the building behind me.  i'm not big on email so feel free to call me.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

to tell me he had been observing what he believed to be a ufo. he told me that he had been watching the object for approximately 20 minutes. he came to get me at approximately 2220 hrs. he said that it caught his attention because it was very bright in the sky where we had never seen a star before. we live under flight paths for hartsfield jackson airport, but we have never observed a plane flying toward us directly from the west before. he thought maybe it was a plane anyway. he noticed as he continued to observe it that it never came nearer or distanced itself, as he thought it might have been a plane coming toward him. he noticed that with the naked eye, he could see red, green and yellow lights moving from right to left horizontally across the object. then the lights would pulsate one color at a time in no particular color pattern, but still only red, green and yellow. i came downstairs and observed the same as my husband. i watched it with the naked eye and binoculars for approximately 20 more minutes. at approximately 2245 i asked my husband to have my brother come outside so he could see it too. my brother came out, witnessing the same as my husband and i. we got out one of my husband's sniper spotting scopes and could see the same as before, but nothing was much clearer. it appeared that when the lights were in motion, they seemed to be moving around an object. when the lights pulsated, it seemed orb like, or rather the lights were larger. after observing a few more minutes, we noticed two planes that we assume we fighter jets because they were at an altitude of approximately 70,000 feet. they did not have a defined flight pattern as one flew under the object from north to south then banked east and flew east northeast over my residence. when wwe noticed the other plane, it was flying west southwest toward the object, also flying over my residence. when we noticed the two planes, the object started moving. it flew north (possibly north northwest due to it becoming dimmer) from its location. it took it approximately 2 minutes to get behind the treeline and exit my field of view. we watched the next night to see if maybe we were mistaken and maybe it was some sort of star, but we have not seen since, nor had ever seen before, anything like what we saw that night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

general time and area, in the mid-1990s near vandenberg afb.  they're the only two sky-related sightings i've ever seen, but a lot of other weird stuff happened around vafb in the 1990s (sounds, electrical/communications interference, etc).\r\n\r\nfor this event, i was sitting with five friends in a hot tub on the air force base itself (military housing).  it was probably around midnight, in late summer.  there were three girls and three boys present, ranging in age from 15 to 20.  it was a clear night, and we were looking up at the stars and talking.  one person noticed what looked like a star begin moving around in the sky, and pointed it out to the rest of us.  at first, we assumed it was a plane, but it didn't have the flashing strobe light on it, and it was spiraling around so erratically that it didn't seem possible that a human could be flying it.  we all stared at it, totally enthralled, trying to figure out what it could possibly be, and then it stopped moving and split in two.  we all gasped/screamed, but still kept watching.  \r\n\r\nwhat had been one weird star was now two of them, and they began the crazy spiraling movements again, almost like they were dancing.  this went on for maybe another minute or so, and then one of them just vanished -- seemingly blinked out of existence -- followed immediately by the other one.  we all confirmed with each other that we had just seen what we thought we saw, and spent the rest of the night arguing over whether it was aliens, ball lightning, or some kind of super-secret military craft.  \r\n\r\nthe entire event lasted probably 5 minutes.  the objects didn't make any noise, and they weren't at all colorful.  they just looked like dancing stars.  i still have no idea what we saw that night.","distance":"Over

the sunset and right after it set we noticed big \"flocks\" of very fast lights zipping all across the sky, we watched them dart all across the sky for about thirty minutes then they just stopped, my friend went home and i went to bed but i couldnt sleep so i just kept watching the sky. sure enough a big single light was slowly hovering above the city over from me and i saw hundreds if not thousands of these faint white lights fly in and out of the multicolored hovering light all night long, i went out to th e roof for a better view around five am. as things were starting to take on a morning glow i noticed the hovering craft start some sort of bright strobe light that lasted for a few minutes and all of the sudden a oval shape craft buzzed over me at about 100 feet. it was moving so fast that i barely saw it, the sound it gave of was like a deep rumble. it shot up into the sky and i lost it among all of the other ufos. then right as the sun came up the hovering ship just vanished, i didnt even see if it flew off, just one second it was there, the next it was gone. i promply went to the bathroom and threw up from the shock of seeing all of this. i didnt believe in aliens one bit before last night..In fact i didnt believe my own eyes for the first few hours of watching. i tried to get video but the lights were faint and my cell phone couldnt pick them up, but after watching the ogden utah sighting video from may 2014 i can say that those were th e same ufos i saw last night 9/4/2014. i know that my lack of video hardly makes this evidence but i know what i saw and after comparing to the recent sightings in houston texas and ogden utah i know those are the same things me and my friend saw.  seems the aliens are here..So cool.

summer of 1996 or 1997.  it was a warm evening, and my best friend (male, age 15/16) and i (female, age 15/16) were lying on our backs on his backyard trampoline, looking up at the stars and talking.  as we talked, i noticed what i assumed to be a satellite -- a small, star-like object traveling silently at a constant, slow rate of speed across the night sky.  i pointed it out to him, and he saw it, too.  then we noticed another identical one nearby traveling at the same rate of speed.  \"wow, two of them, what are the odds?\" was our reaction, until we quickly noticed a third identical light, and that all three lights were moving in formation as a perfect equilateral triangle.  \r\n\r\njust as we were commenting on how weird that was, we noticed that as the three lights passed across the sky, the \"triangle\" they formed blocked our view of the stars between them.  that's when we realized it was a single solid object, not three satellites.  we both became terrified and ran inside his house to get away from it.  \r\n\r\ni have no idea how high up it was, but since the lights looked like little satellites, i think it was pretty high up.  if so, it had to be huge -- maybe hundreds of feet across.  it made no sound and was traveling north-by-northeast in a straight line at a constant, slow rate of speed.  i think that if we had stayed outside to watch it, it could have taken at least five or ten minutes to pass out of our range of view.  we lived right next to vandenberg afb, and in the years since the incident, i have come to believe that what we saw was an advanced, \"skunk works\"-type aircraft on a test flight.  at the time, however, it scared the crap out of us.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

was scouting in the south west skies,to north.I noticed a ball of energy,much like an explosion,in the west skies a few hundred feet off ground level and at a distance of approx a few miles at most.This was followed within seconds by another exact \"explosion\" which then merged with the former.It was becoming bigger & brighter,then from its right hand-side protruded a burst of fire/light/energy which eventually formed a yellow/orange crescent in the sky with a number of points of energy along its length,like yellow stars.I would guess at between 7&9 points.Then each of these points of energy seemed to \"pop\" in sequence until they had all disintegrated soon followed by the original source until the skies were clear.This lasted for about 30 seconds in all.\r\nabout 20 minutes later i spotted two orange,crown green bowling ball shape,objects very high in the sky,guessing at 10k feet,travelling from south to north west at a slow speed and in tandem. this was then followed by a bright white object travelling much faster but in the opposite direction,at similar altitude but with an erratic flight path,as if it was constantly changing altitudes,up/down during travel.\r\naround midnight is when i noticed a blue light descending very fast in the s/w skies around a mile or so away from me.This blue object was flying in a zig zag path just above the trees/houses straight towards me.It got to within 100 yards from me,slightly paused on the turn & shot off up the adjacent road at tremendous speed!.This was followed by a larger blue object descending from the skies at a slower speed than the first & in a weaving path as opposed to a zigzag path.But this time \"it\" glided right over my house at a altitude which was no more than 25feet above my position,which was by this time actually hanging out my window with my camera in hand,& at a speed of approx 50kph.On closer inspection i found it was larger because it was two objects flying side by side,but one slightly higher than the other.They were approx 15ft wide by 3ft,12inches deep & of a rectangular shape,a black matt body with blue lights around the edges top & bottom.As it flew by i could hear it slicing the air & actually felt the air stream against my face!! by this time my heart was pounding & i was full of frustration that i was alone. soon,another one appeared which followed the same path as the first blue object.It got within 50 yards of me & flew off in the same direction as the first at the same speed.I then after a minute or so decided to go & see if i could see where the two objects where at the front of my house.I then witnessed the two objects returning from the east gliding at approx 50kph at an altitude of 50 ft above the houses.It was one of the most amazing but frustrating times of my life as i had no one their to witness it with me,but quickly phoned my son to tell him what i had just seen,just in case they came back for me.The videos i am sending are of very poor quality unfortunately.In the first video the crescent is to be found above the bathroom light in the house.In the second video the two blue objects flew towards me,but as i

so many possibilities. i have often watched ufo-related shows and videos, hoping to hear of an object like this one but have yet to hear of anything even remotely similar. \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":59562,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.29389703010374,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09042014-0009","longitude":-79.10685572727623,"occurred":1113181260000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1409850721000,"summary":"5year old nephew & i standing my mother's porch. absolutely silent/still outside; from the corner of my eye, i detected movement. we both turned & watched as it, without sound or visible means of propulsion, made its way across the street @3mph  ","tags":["sound"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"28326","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3433,"locationName":"Cameron, North Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:109638"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Quakertown","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I observed a hovering object in the western sky of upper bucks county, pa, shortly after 10pm while taking out the trash. my first thought was that i was witnessing a very bright star. however, i immediately realized that the object was much larger than any star or planet (much larger than jupiter) and was pulsating extremely bright, vivid, and varied colors. the object three dimensional and appeared top be pyramid or diamond shaped. the object flashed randomly in intense red, orange, blue, green, yellow, and white. as a licensed pilot i immediately recognized that these are not standard aviation colors. the object was fairly fay away, probably a few miles away. i ruled out a standard aircraft because the object hovered for about 30 minutes before moving very slowly in a west/northwest direction. the object did not appear to be a helicopter due to the apparent large size of the object, the intensity of the lighting, and the multicolor display that were atypical of faa approved lighting. although i could not rule out a blimp, i thought that it would need to be a very large blimp such as the type that might float over sport stadiums. given that there are no large sport stadiums in upper bucks county, i thought that it would be very odd for a blimp to be floating in the sky late at night on a work night. my family and i viewed the object through binoculars. i was impressed with the beauty of the light display.
