sky i noticed several redish orangish pale lights northeast of my direction. initially i thought it was a plane but i quickly realized that it wasn't making any noise, it was too low for a normal plane and it wasn't moving. there was a definite shape to it and i believe these lights were attached to the object and weren't independent of each other. i think it might have been a triangle similar to the one i observed in this same area a few months ago with different colored lights, however i'm not positive on the exact shape due to the distance and angle i was from the object. the lights seemed to pulsate simultaneously with eachother. i only got to observe the object for about a minute and then it just faded out and never reappeared.\r\n\r\ni see planes here at night often and i am

noticed the light. they ran inside from the back yard and got 3 more witnesses to go out front of the house where we watched it continue across the sky. the white object pulsed brightly several times when straight overhead, at roughly 2 seconds intervals. it had a trail at all times it was visible, about 3 or 4 degrees in length (6 to 8 times the width of the moon). toward the end of its flight it appeared to break into two pieces. having the witnesses individually reenact the sighting pinned the timing down to 50 to 55 seconds. i was in the basement and because it took me 15 or more seconds longer to get notified i saw it the least of anyone, but was still able to see a dim rusty trail drift down towards the north-north-east horizon and slowly disappear behind the roof line of a house across the street, probably 5 degrees above the horizon. its angular velocity appeared faster than an airplane or the iss (we watch that often), but much slower than any fireball we've ever seen. at

and for about ten seconds saw a triangular aircraft probably of an altitude of 300 to 4oo feet. made no noise. had flashing white lights on what appeared to be wings. red and bluish green lights were underneath. the thing that startled me was i heard nothing, no sound as it approached or it past. i thought it may have been a plane when i first saw it but it is very cloudy tonight and the craft was lower than any plane of that size i have seen at that altitude.I don't think i would have noticed it unless my phone got screwed up. was moving in a straight path and constant speed as it was lost from sight behind trees. there was a strange blue flash that appeared to be like a camera flash a few seconds before i noticed my phone wasn't working and i happened to see the object. it startled me quite a bit and strangely my dogs began barking as i was outside, immediately as i saw the craft. the dogs were inside the house. one of my dogs is deaf and she barked as well (don't know why, she never does).","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings, Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

thought it was the reflection on a plane but it didn't move.  i look at planes all the time since i work around the airport.  it was not a plane, not a blimp, or a helicopter.  i finally lost sight of
