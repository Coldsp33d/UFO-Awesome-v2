States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This happened around july or august 1985 to the best of my knowledge. \r\n\r\ni was traveling on i-435 west toward i-35 south after leaving our home in kansas city, ks en-route to olathe, ks. my just under six year old son was in the front seat of the car with me and my one year old in the back in his car seat. i remember it was about 10:30pm because we were on our way to pick up my then-husband from work at mid-america nazarene college in olathe, ks. he worked evening shift and we had one car otherwise the children would’ve been in bed by that time. above was a dark, cloudless sky as i was driving with the radio on. i thought it odd that the radio announcer was saying that the residents in the area were not to be alarmed by what we were seeing as it wasn’t a ufo but merely a russian satellite re-entering orbit. i thought, “well, that’s weird.” but i was in my mid-20s and busy raising kids, so didn’t think much about it. i didn’t see anything at the immediate time of the announcement but when i got further down the highway all of a sudden this huge rectangle object that had glowing red-orange borders lighting up any linear shape within and outside it came slowly, very slowly floating above. it had a grid pattern to it as if a building were cut in half and you could see all the stories of the floors lit up along the edges. they weren’t windows unless it could be described as floor to ceiling windows that were unobstructed. it actually looked as if the walls were transparent. i could see what would be the right side of the craft and the underbelly looking from an angle.  all this happened within a couple minutes of hearing the radio broadcast. when it was still behind me somewhat because i could see it peripherally, i noticed that there were many cars pulled over on the side of the highway going both south and north bound. a lot of cars with their occupants outside of them looking and pointing up into the air. normally, i’d never do such a thing as to pull over on an interstate highway unless it was major important but this now met that criteria. even my young son was wondering aloud why all the people were outside by the road. i pulled over and even allowed him to come stand beside me, eventually sitting him on the trunk of the car to have him close. by that time the usual busy highway had slowed down both due to the later hour but also because so many of us had stopped to watch “something outta this world”. it was completely silent except the few cars that i guess had a lot more going on than to bother to stop and look at this giant glowing box moving slow overhead. i could see each detail of the “floors” that looked large enough for a small plane or car to go through an opening as if it were a multi-storied hanger. each outline of a wall or floor made up numerous stories high and glowed red-orange. i swear i thought i could even see an outline silhouette of a couple of “people” in different “windows” but chalked that up to seeing things. i mean, i was looking at a giant floating box!, the insanity of seeing people within it didn’t seem too far away. the object seemed like it was a couple football fields in length and a football field in height. it passed by about a half mile above. my six year old was bug-eyed and held my hand tightly. i wasn’t afraid so much as i was curious, intrigued, and dumbfounded. i didn’t feel like we were in any danger. we stayed watching for about a half hour as it moved from what seems like the northeast to the southwest direction. i’m not great at directions so that’s my best shot. the land is flat in that area around so there were no obstructions to block my view. after about 20-30 minutes i got to thinking my husband was going to get worried that we hadn’t arrived yet. i told my son we needed to get going as we had seen the whole thing go right over top of us. we started back on the road and again the radio was repeating how it wasn’t a ufo but a burning up satellite and that just didn’t feel right to me. it felt like a ufo experience, most definitely. it looked outer worldly. i glanced away as i re-entered the highway. as i got a little bit further down the road the object seemed to disappear. i told my husband about it about it and my son was excitedly adding in his observations. i kept listening to the news on tv or the radio the next few days to hear anything else about it and there was none. just a total clam up about the event. after that night i didn’t discuss it anymore until just a few months ago during a phone conversation with my now grown son. during our visit he suddenly asked me if i remember, “...The ufo we saw when i was little…?” inside me i was elated. i was so happy to hear that it wasn’t some kind of false memory, that i’d made some story up. even though i’d not talked about it since the event i certainly did think of it. my adult son started describing to me what he remembered and it was so much of the same experience i had at the time. he was like, “wow, mom.” and i was like…”no kidding, son, it was something else!”","distance":"101-500

and my self were standing in my yard observing a small hawk on the hunt for squirrels and small prey for lunch in out neighborhood.  as we watched him dodge and dart about i looked up for mr. hawk and plain as day and clear as a bell we saw 25 orbs in a frenzy and all working the same area. these objects or orbs were kind of clear to blue in color. they initially looked to be big bubbles  and then my friend and i both noticed that these orbs had small wedge like wings on them. kind of like a bubble with sharp \"v\" shaped wings attached to the center of the orbs. each orb had two wings. one on each side of the round orb or object. the wings were pointed and sharply joined in the front and then flaring out and progressively become wider at the back of the object. they were 100% not just floating in the wind and being tossed about by the wind currents... while my friend tried to take a picture with his cell phone, i counted each and every one of them within my sight. there were 25 of them. all orbs were totally busily working in a fixed area straight out in front of us and absolutely nothing to block our view. they looked to be focused  on working in a small contained area in the sky.  some orbs moved up, some down, some side ways and all at the same time saying close to one another.  constant movement in all directions. but never straying from their original area that we sighted them in . kind of looked like fish feeding on fish food. that type of a pattern.  we watched for about two minutes and then this group started to move off to the north of us. we walked about 90 feet as to look again and they seemed to just fade out as they sped on quickly out of our sight. my friend was constantly trying to take pictures with his cell phone and it is a good one. it would not take pictures of the orbs...My friends cell phone totally went down and out with no power for about five minutes and within about five minutes after the orbs were gone..His phone powered right up and working fine. i have never seen a ufo of any type in my life and i have looked many times as to see one and not with one result until today at 330pm on 11-19-17. and in my own back yard.  i am an older man now and too old to waste my time telling big lies on the internet for attention. my friend saw it all as well.  clear as a bell. no chance for in the world for it to be any thing other than 25 orbs with easy to see wings on them.  good day.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s), Wings","flightPath":"Hovering

( i am no astronomer, i worked in it at the time.)  now you know how you often look up at night and you see one of those very high, fast-moving dots that are obviously satellites; from my experience if you spend a while stargazing you're almost guaranteed to see one.  anyway on this night i also caught sight of one of these 'satellites.'   however, now imagine the same dot *suddenly* get bigger and faster *simultaneously,* giving the appearance of something that had descended very rapidly, which i thought was odd.  i initially thought that i had been following a satellite that had somehow crossed paths (albeit at hugely different heights) with a commercial airliner. then i waited a few seconds and to my astonishment it descended again, now moving faster; a brighter, larger dot of light, of the kind of size and speed you would associate with a low-flying light aircraft, but i confirm it had no flashing lights.   finally, the object suddenly 'descended' again into a large, dull, fuzzy orange disc/oval; absolutely featureless.   now the key here is the object then started to perform 'arc' manoeuvres in the sky.  to best describe this, imagine someone shining an orange-coloured torch light against a wall, and flicking it back and forth with the wrist in an arc, giving the impression of something moving at an unimpressive speed but with immediate acceleration.  i watched it for about 5 minutes, desperately trying to think what it could be.  there were no orange streetlights, and there was no cloud cover at all onto which a projector could have been aimed.  after this 5 minutes it went behind the 'horizon' which was actually just a medium-sized industrial complex (nothing special, it was called vandervell engineering and they made engine bearings at the time, my dad worked there.)   anyway, i went back in, very puzzled, and carried on reading the book.  i kept checking outside from time to time.   finally, after about half an hour, i went outside and the object reappeared from behind the backdrop of factories, still describing arcs in the sky.  it then stopped, and proceeded to ascend smoothly, this time to the kind of 'height' and luminosity that you might ascribe to a mid-level commercial aircraft, changing colour from a dull orange to more of a white dot.  finally, the bright dot accelerated unbelievably quickly and flew across the sky at precisely the kind of ultra-high speed you would normally associate with a shooting star.  this was a clear sky, no clouds, very little light pollution, about 2:30 in the morning in maidenhead, berkshire, about 30 miles west of london, facing approximately east, about 25 years ago. \r\n     \r\n   i was really quite spooked by the incident, but i forgot about it, as you do, and it wasn't until a year or so later that i read a newspaper article about historic ufo sightings that it all came back to me. this was a 'feature' story in - i believe, either the daily mail or the mail on sunday, and it was one of those big 4-page feature type stories they run from time to time.   anyway, it was a big feature about historical ufo sightings and one really caught my eye - it described a ufo encounter witnessed by the pilots of a squadron of us airplanes in the 1960's i think, and one pilot's description of the object and its flight characteristics was *precisely* the same thing that i had witnessed - he described it as having descended rapidly, performed random arcs, before shooting off again at incredible speed.  i've always meant to revisit this article, but i'm afraid i'm pretty clueless when it comes to making historical searches in newspapers, maybe at some point in the future the british library will finally get all historical newspapers onto their database and i can do a search, as i'm convinced the only explanation is extraterrestrial.\r\n\r\n  so, for what its worth, that's my record of the sighting.  maybe it will come in use at some point when cross-referencing sighting types or what have you.\r\nanyway, all the best.\r\nnick.\r\n\r\np.S. for the record, the reason i'm writing this now is that tonight i've been idly watching hangar 1 ufo mufon files on the tv.   i've reported this sighting before as said, but mainly to some low-key british ufo associations but never heard anything back, so i thought why not log it with you guys.   disappointingly i've never seen anything like it since.  i was lucky enough a few years back to see a  fireball, ie a meteor skipping off the the atmosphere or a maybe a bit of space junk burning up which was quite spectacular, but nothing like this. \r\n\r\nhave a great day.\r\nnick.\r\n   ","distance":"501 Feet -

bed. we were talking, i was turned towards her and she was looking off to my left, directly in front of the porch up above the treetops. her eyes were so big and the look on her face actually made me stop talking and ask, are you okay? she didn't even look at me, she just asked, dude what are those? \"those\" like objects, not just stars or a plane or a shuttle. i felt my stomach drop as soon as she said it, and whipped my head around to look ahead of my. i saw two lights that reminded me of the northern star,very bright. but i instantly got goosebumps.\r\n \r\nnow, brooke is afraid of aliens, dare i say a phobia. i wanted to remain calm. at this point we had grabbed onto each others hands, communicating silently, just watching these slightly wavering orbs that seemed so like a star. its like looking into a well and being dizzied by the depth that you cant see - my eyes wanted to believe they were very far away, but they seemed to be in the not so distant sky.\r\n\r\nthe two hovered, the right slightly above the left, for almost a minute. then, like a mother goose and her babies, the higher one made a swooping turn going first straight up and gliding left as the the other orb caught up to it. i got a terrible shock  just then, almost like someone had socked me in the gut. it felt so wrong, so unnatural, like it wasn't possible. i squeezed brooke hand as her nails dug into mine, both still silently supporting each other as they moved.\r\n\r\nthey finished their arc, not moving what seemed all that far, and stopped as they \"fizzled away\" almost like a puff of smoke disappearing. no trailing arms, just less and less until it was gone, a matter of a second. \r\n\r\ni immediately said \"we just saw two f*cking ufo's!\" and her reply was \"no! this is not okay!\" and i helped her up as she was struggling to run inside. inside i held her for a minute and realized we were both crying, breathing incredibly rapidly, and shaking terribly. the hair was standing on my entire body, and even my dog couldn't stop grunting under her breath because she could tell something was wrong outside. \r\n\r\nwe've both felt very spiritually sensitive all of our lives, but i believe that we both have felt changes since that day, and a tone of wariness. i wish i had an explanation.

light that emanated from these anomalies, and they were randomly \"dancing in the sky\", at what seemed treetop level and slightly higher; circling, moving in all directions in a very close pattern. other objects of the same caliber would join in appearing and reappearing. they were transparent, resembling the characteristic makeup of a jellyfish. i was able to observe one close enough to see it did have a transparent structure outside of the light which was predominant. internally it appeared to have channeled,blackish vein-like structures that i can only say looked like a gas. as a former marine having served in intelligence, i am familiar with strategic moving vehicles, however, there was nothing i could see or imagine threatening in these close aerial movements. the objects simply disappeared before our eyes one,two,three at a time, maintaining the same close pattern with a few more anomalies joining late. the fantastic event lasted for about half an hour, only three or four more materialized in a fifteen minute time frame. i called the local police department around three o'clock to find out if there were any reports, they had received none at that time.
