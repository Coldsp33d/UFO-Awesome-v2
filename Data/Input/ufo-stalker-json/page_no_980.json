north. so far off, at first i was a little excited as i thought morning might be iss station. i continued walking about another minute and looked up again. same object in sky but now, please don't laugh, another object appeared almost as if it popped in, no, it didn't come out of a cloud bank either, just appeared. i watched as both objects headed towards each other, then, literally, stopped and headed in different directions. wasn't scared, just a little bewildered and amazed. looked around for someone else walking or neighbors outside to ask if they saw what i was seeing, of course, no one. watched sky again and finished walk looking up severs times again but saw nothing. i'm in dayton, ohio right near wpafb so could have been anything. i checked online. nothing at the moment.

open to woods behind our house, i saw a light so unusual that i jumped out of my chair to look at it.  i realized that i had seen it about two nights earlier just very briefly as it passed byï¿½ but at the time gave it no thought other than it was characteristically unusual but did not stop.  that time i jumped up too, it was so odd.   \r\nthe spherical light appeared at 8:15 pm by clearing the trees.  in fact, i could see that something was preparing to emerge, it was so bright.   \r\nthe nature of the light that was so unusual is not only its brilliance, but that it appeared to be constructed of many hundreds of ï¿½raysï¿½ that were a bit wider at the origin of the sphere, but which became pointed at the outside of its halo.  i have seen many different lights, spotlights, strobes, brilliant incandescent, fluorescent, etcï¿½ but never anything of this nature.  nothing like this has ever been part of any type of aircraft that i am aware of either.\r\nthe light hovered for about 2 minutes and was constantly lit.   it came from precisely 240 degrees, or nnw, and just floated and was probably 1-2 miles away...Although it was hard to be precise.  the angle was 15 degrees from the horizon.   almost anywhere between us and 2 miles distant would place if over the undeveloped western shore of blue springs lake.\r\nit was a bright light unlike anything i have ever seen, but then moved away to our left in the general direction that would lead to lakeland lake, and out of sight.  when it turned westerly, what may have been behind it appeared as a red second light almost as large as the first.  it may also have morphed into toï¿½ canï¿½t say for sure.  the front one very bright yellowish white, the second was red.   the lights stayed on, but did seem to pulse.

like a toy spinning top with lights on the cone and on the bottom in a circular pattern which i could see as it wobbled.  the lights were green, red, yellow, and sometimes bright white or blue.\r\n\r\nthe strangest thing about the event occurred approximately 15-20 minutes after i first sighted the object.  an extremely large helicopter, virtually silent, came in from the east, going west, just north of the apartment complex i live in.  i could make out the shape of the helicopter, but none of the details on it.  it was jet black, with no lights on in the cabin.  it couldn't have been further than a football field away from me.  i could barely hear the rotors on it.  it had only red running lights and none of these lights were blinking.  it looked like it was rectangular shape.  the closest variant i could even come close to comparing it to is the ch-53 super stallion - but that's just a guess.  it was moving very fast at about 300 feet of altitude.  i live in a valley (chenal valley), it flew over the western edge of the valley and i lost sight of it. \r\n\r\nto be honest, i just assumed i was seeing venus or the atmospheric distortion of a star.  i've seen it twice now since that night, but it does not appear every night.  i saw it again last night and used binoculars to verify the shape and lighting configuration which match what i saw with the naked eye.  i saw it around 10 pm last night in the same position i saw it in at 2 a.M. on the 12th.  it rose in the sky (like a star or planet), until i could no longer make out it's shape or coloring.\r\n\r\nplease someone just confirm that i saw a planet or star and the blinking colors were just air pollution refracting the light and i can move on with my life.  i accept that my eyes could be playing tricks on me.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":59508,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.8125041,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09022014-0013","longitude":-92.48496589999999,"occurred":1407834120000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cone","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1409689943000,"summary":"Hovers, wobbles. not a star or planet.  multiple blinking lights. cone shape on top -

husband looked at the ne sky and noticed what appeared to be a planet and asked me if i noticed it - i told him that there was no planet in the ne this month. it seemed to sparkle and have alternating colors and we were unable to determine a distinct shape . it hovered in the sky for over 10 minutes a i got out of the pool to get my astronomy binoculars and gave them to my husband while he was in the pool, he was amazed that the colors of the lights did change  (white, red, blue, green) . my daughter came out and looked at the object, she saw the same thing, then i looked through the binoculars and witnessed the same alternating flashing lights on this hovering object. my husband then found his camcorder and was able to record this object. the object was still in the same spot at 2am. i wanted to report the object to 911 but, my husband told me knot to because we have a family member that works for the local municipal government.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":59497,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.440653399999995,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09022014-0002","longitude":-78.6540442,"occurred":1409641200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1409650859000,"summary":"Flashing

there were two planes in the sky, it was near them, then all of a sudden it just steaked down the side of the mountain, and was gone. it was amazing, i have never seen anything like it. it was just a brightly glowing round green light, it was probably the size of a small bus best i could tell from were it was it was moving around below some regular planes in the sky, then when i started to watch it was just still for a few seconds, then all of a sudden it streaked down the side of the mountain and was gone. i never saw it again.  this is the first time i have ever reported anything, i did experience one other instance many years back. but it was nothing like this. about 15 yrs ago, i was in manchester ky, early in the morning like 2 or 3 am one niht wile sitting at a stop light with no traffic around, above me was a huge square building just floating over the 4 lane, it was maybe about 40-50 foot above the road. it looked like a huge building just floating across and then it was gone, blocked by the trees, that's all. i wish i could have captured these moments, they were so unexpected, and i do have a witness to both times, i was not alone. i hope my report helps in someway with answers or a better understanding. there really is something strange out there that we dont understand..","distance":"501 Feet - 1

traverse bay in the northern lower peninsula of michigan. the moon was less than half full and becoming orange as it was settling down on the horizon mostly west but slightly southwest of our position. the sky overhead was full of stars and the wind was almost calm though slight, variable breezes would occur. the waves in the bay were moving from north to south. you could hear a truck off in the distance for several miles and several minutes until it faded away. we were waiting for it to disappear so that we could witness complete silence with exception to waves and crickets. at approximately 23:15, i noticed a red light above the bay coming from south to north (left to right). it was common for aircraft to fly along the bay but most often it would be a coastguard helicopter or a care flight air ambulance going from traverse city to charlevoix or petoskey at that time of night. the coast guard helicopter is red and i thought since the light was red it was probably them but i continued to observe expecting to hear the typical sound made by copters and to see a blinking light. i estimated the craft to be 4 miles south of us and pointed it out to my friend. when it had traveled another several seconds i recalled thinking it was traveling the speed i expected a helicopter to move. its course was level and unchanging. when it was about a mile south, i said that it was odd we couldn’t hear it since it was so quiet outside. this made me think maybe it was a small plane of some type since they are sometimes less noisy. i continued to monitor its unchanging flight and at the point it passed the directly in front of our location i asked my friend “what is that? there’s no strobe light and no sound.” he didn’t have an answer and neither did i. at this point, i estimated the object to be about 300 feet above the bay and maybe 5-7 miles out ... which is to say ½ of the way to the leelanua peninsula or right down the middle of the bay. the object never seemed to be definable with regard to shape though it was rounder than any other shape since it was just a fairly bright red light and i guess at that distance it seemed rounded. as i write this recollection it occurs to me that the object may have been a bit closer since i really couldn’t determine its size and i had no sound to use as a guide. nonetheless, the object continued its heading and maintained the same altitude on its northerly flight. i changed my position on the deck in order to continue my observation until trees obstructed my view. i am curious what this was but might tend to believe it is something man made. perhaps a drone of some type.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

multiple lights in triangular formation flying over the denver area. these lights were white/yellow/reddish. there were at least 9 lights because there was several triangles created by these lights, they were definitely not a) fireworks or b) parachuters. i know this because the lights lasted at least 4-5 minutes and flew from denver toward aurora. there are a few people on youtube with comments saying they saw 6-10 lights in aurora that night as well. we thought they might be airplanes but we could hear fireworks from quite a distance (downtown denver) and these lights made no noise whatsoever. several other people nearby made remarks about these lights as well. \r\ni could not be more of a skeptic, personally. because of this i idiotically did not film these lights with my phone. i assumed i would look up a good explanation for them the next day. i have been looking into this for a time and cannot find a satisfactory explanation. the parachuters that night were probably only 4-5 people at most and the videos i have seen of these do not resemble the lights i saw, which definitely had a trajectory toward the east and formed more than one triangle. i regret not having written this report sooner. i hope someone on lookout mountain that day might have some footage so i can be sure of what i saw.
