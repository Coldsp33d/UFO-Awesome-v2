top.It had a definite aura or lightness/darkness around the object.I am x-military and no that this was no plane,helicopter,drone or like.It was also not traveling in a plane route,and moved very strangely.I would guess its size of 400 ft round,but not perfectly round.It also reminded me of a moving hole in the atmosphere being jet black/dark blue against the light blue/white clouds.When it

our to an hour, i left my place and enjoyed a peacefull evening stroll. i was walking through a dark alley that cut through two apt building ending up at a old school that is across the road from the high school which has several large football feilds. while in the alley heading home i talked breifly too  a group of guys who claimed to have seen a ufo in the sky and if i hurried over to the field i could still catch them, he pointed me in the direction that they seen the ufo and said they have to leave. i hurried over too the feild and did not notice anything and thought for sure i had missed them, shortly after about a minute of observing the sky i observed some lights that seemed to come from nowhere, i saw five bright circular lights in the sky that were in a boomerange like v formation, the ufo was in the very bottom part of the cloud layer and the clouds around the ufo's lights vanished all around for hundreds of feet. i felt a feeling of fear and astonishment when i first seen the craft, the lights were in the east direction moving south climbing in altitude, i observed the lights as they began to get smaller, the light started to pulsate and grow brighter when the ufo dissapeared in a streak of light much like what a shooting star looked like only the streak of light traveled into space instead of the ground. i was still watching the sky and observed a light travel back from the direction in which it had shot away, the light was moving at super speeds because it traveled towards myself growing a bit brighter, the lights then slowed down and stayed stationary. the sighting lasted for about ten minutes and occured just after 9 pm. i could still make out the ufo when i left the school field.\r\n\r\ni walked home very excited about what i had just observed and the first thing i was going to say to my roomate was if he wanted too come and take a look at a ufo in the sky near the highschool, so i came upstairs gave his door a quick knock and enteed his room. i was instantly hit by a big gust of wind that mad the curtains hit the roof and i almost blacked out, it felt like i had been drugged or was overcome by s deamonic dark presence, i remember seeing a dark shadow creature come over me freezing me with fear. i thought immidiatly to myself oh my god i just had my roomate abducted and i went to the living room where i noticed that 20 minutes had elapsed in 40 seconds, i looked around the house for my roomate and finally found him outside when i told him the things that had just happened, he didnt think it was crazy at all. i was overcome by an energy and dreading feeling that i had too get out of the house, i thought for sure i was going to be abducted and i did not want to put anyones life in danger.\r\n\r\n i left the house and walked for about an hour too a picnic table at a small creek that was still in the city but it was late and i barely observed a vehicle. at this time i was starting to calm down and was beginning to accept what had recently happened to me, i was a little bit on edge because i jumped when something came out of the bushes, it turned out to be a dog that stopped to take a drink out of the creek and  ontinued on his way.\r\n\r\nit was starting to get late, approximately 1 am, i grabbed my backpack and was about to head to the road when i heard something i  the bushes again and thought it was the dog havi g another drink at the creek so i walked down to the waters edge to see if i  could pet him and make a friend, i was mistaken because i observed two short human like creatures, around 4' tall and a slender build, they had dark eyes that were larger then our own and no visible hair clothes to speak off. the creatures were dark in colour but not black, possibly a dark grey. i watched the et's run away from me running towards a carwash looking back at me for a glance, the one et jumped o top of a car with ease and ran over the top of it jumping down and continuing to follow the other et as they ran into the dark where i could not make them out. i i stantly thought\" if they are running that way i am going this way\" and i made my way to the brightly light highway that was nearby. i was honestly scared of these things and all i wanted to do at this time was too feel safe. i honestly dont know what they were going to do to me or why they ran away, it has even crossed my mind that perhaps they were either comming to drink water from the creek or were stalking the stray dog that recently came from the path that the et's were. i accept now that we are not alone and am

while conversing with mr. \"b\", knowing i was with mufon he stated to me that on several occasions he had seen orbs of red light about the brightness of the moon traveling at elevation about 1/2 over the horizon from the northwest to the southwest sometimes in numbers from two (2) to seven (7) at a time. he stated that the objects moved in a floating to fast moving manner in which they seemed to be controlled, \"not in a way shooting stars move\" and made no sound. he also stated that objects were approximately a mile away and about approximately three thousand feet in the air. he stated that from where he was viewing them they were about the size of a basketball and upon looking at them through his telescope that they seemed to have the \"divited-like\" surface pattern of a golf ball. he stated when the objects would reach a certain point that they would simply blink out and disappear. mr \"b\" stated that his wife mrs. {name removed/cms/tg], his step daughter \"m\" and her husband

command master chief in the navy, invited us to okinawa japan. the ufo sighting i am referring to occurred on november 7th, 2006 above chicago's o'hare airport. our plane was united airlines flight 0878 and i was seated in row 37(i still have my boarding pass). the sighting happened at roughly 4:00 pm. our plane was descending to land and i was waiting to see the airport as we were passing through the clouds. when we cleared the cloud level, i immediately saw the airport and gradually noticed a grey, round object. this object was motionless. i know this because our altitude's \"crossed\". meaning there was a definite moment when we were above it, a moment when we were level, and a moment when we were below it. it was during this transition in altitudes that i have my most vivid memory of it's description. it was elliptical in shape, dull grey, with no visible markings. there were no openings for windows or doors. as we landed i lost sight of it but saw it again as our plane was turning on the tarmac. i cannot say if it was still in the same location but as we were moving it stayed in the same position. it's size at that moment was about the size of a half dollar held at arm's length. i remember the flight attendant handing me a customs pamphlet to fill out. i looked at her and looked back at the object. it was still there. within seconds of me looking back at it, it rapidly \"shot\" up. the only way i can describe this movement is if you were to hold an object at eye level, release it and watch it fall to the ground. in other words, imagine the cloud level as the ground and the object \"falling\" towards it. i remember ducking to see where it might have gone. i remember seeing a \"hole\" in the cloud level. i also remember seeing light reflected off the interior of the hole so the hole must have went straight through the cloud level. i did not mention this to anyone accept my wife who did not see any of this happening. it was only later, in january of 2007, that i saw a news story of this object that i had saw. in this story they mentioned that the workers on the tarmac and some pilots had seen this object so i knew i had not hallucinated this event. i remember being shaky after we left the plane and went through customs. that's all that happened. i have never seen a ufo before and never since. i don't know what it was but i know what it wasn't. it wasn't a drone or military craft. why would the military be flying a secret craft above one of the busiest airports in the country? it wasn't a weather event. i've been thinking about this for the last 7+ years and have come to realize that for it to go from completely motionless to fast enough to punch a hole through the clouds, it would have created a sonic boom probably powerful enough to shatter every window in the airport. how it did not do this is probably a bigger mystery than the object itself.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
