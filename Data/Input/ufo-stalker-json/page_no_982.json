a strange object glowing a brilliant orange in the sky just above the tree line. immediately we thought it to be a planet but after concluding that it was far too bright to be a planet we continued to observe it.\r\n      after about 30 seconds, remaining in the same location, the light began to dim gradually while retaining its initial color until it was no longer visible, after which it began to immediately glow again, far less bright than before and began to steadily move to the right. as it moved, the object began to change colors from orange to red and back at about a 1 second interval. it was not the light pattern of a plane as the colors and interval were both incorrect. the object followed its course until the tree line obscured it from view. after believing the object to be gone, we left the area.\r\n       after calling the closest airforce base only to find out it was closed, we returned to the same spot about 30 minutes later. to our surprise a faint orange light, in the same position as the earlier one, began to glow brighter and followed the initial pattern, this time moving to the left however until it dissapeared behind the treeline. after this, another appeared more to the right, rising very slowly and then began to follow the original pattern to the right until it seemed to dissappear from view. after this, another appeared in the orginal spot and the pattern was repeated by at least two others. these lights appeared to hover for a longer duration than earlier.  during this time, i recorded two videos of the events. another object appeared far to the right and appeared to move towards our location. after witnessing this, we left.\r\n      about 15 minutes later, we returned and began to watch the objects from a new location approximately 400 feet from the initial location. there we witnessed two dim orange lights above the treeline. one dissapeared from view while the other began to glow suddenly, much to our surprise. around this time, a police helicopter flew toward the area of the lights. the objects and the helicopter did not appear to make contact. after watching the strange lights for about 15 minutes, one began to hover overhead and it appeared to have a cigar shape or at least what appeared to be a tail, although i am not certain of this. this was odd as the videos recorded earlier revealed that the objects were in the shape of a circle flashing orange and white at a short interval. the object now flying near us emmitted a strange humming sound, too quiet to be a helicopter as we heard a helicopter only a few minutes earlier. after this we left the area and i did not see the objects again. the humming sound however occurred throughout the night and was heard by several people throughout different locations in the forest. our group split up and i was told by some of the people that were present during the initial encounter that one of the objects later dipped to avoid a plane. however i am not sure that this happened and do not know the details as i was not present. this happened at least an hour later. at least 9 objects were observed that night by at least 7 people. the majority of these objects appeared in the same location. we were terrified as well as intrigued.

(my grandfather was a major in the airforce, a fighter pilot and a cargo pilot for sair aviation. i was an infantry marine, all my life i have lived within 5 miles of airports and flown in and been around airplanes and military.) i may have seen one thing like this on a video on you tube but have not been able to find it. i believe it was a video clip from monster quest or ancient aliens. i will continue to look for it and upload it if i do happen to find it... the \"pulsating\" object was approximately one to two miles away which made its size approximately 3 to 4 times the size of the fuselage of a 747 airliner.  it moved from northeast, south to due east, then back over to north hovering a few spots in between. its speed was between 250 and 500 mph, using the general speed of an airliner at the same height of about 15,000 to 20,000 feet. finally in the north it was hidden by a cloud after about 15 minutes of maneuvering. i have a few other reports to make as well in the same manner. about 6 to 8 times over the last 3 months starting memorial day weekend we have been seeing this bright light in the sky just appear out of nowhere travel a little ways and then disappear or fade away. the first time a beam of light came out of it. at first i thought it was a satellite along with the space station as we saw it simultaneously with the space station, however the nasa satellite charts prove otherwise and the speed and times are too erratic... given the approximate distance of the satellites the object must be at least as high if not a little closer, but that makes the speed of the object to vary from 17,300 to 10,000 to 51,000 mph...Sometimes it moves in 90 degree angles  sometimes it moves in sharp 180 degree turns... if one would spend a week observing the northern celestial hemisphere around cassiopeia toward the east, between the hours of 2145 and 0230 you can be sure to see it at some point at least around where we live in syracuse. thank you very

and there were no missed calls or messages or anything to have cause my phone to be causing the vibrating, which at this stage was very loud. \r\nthe bright blue/turquoise beam or light that was

well.\r\n\r\nuntil i saw it i dismissed them as 'probably shooting stars', but then we started noticing that whatever these were were actually 'shooting' in all different directions, up, down, and sideways. they were super fast, like they were 'dipping out' of the clouds in the eastern sky, 'shooting' straight to the west, and then 'shooting up' back into the cloud base, all in like a half-second. we saw several more of these craft/lights do this, alternating between e-w and n-s trajectories. very strange. \r\n\r\nthe 'craft', it they were, were to us just very very bright

groupings were seen, three lights in front, two in rear.  lights were moving relative to each other and stars could be seen between the lights indicating they were not connected by any solid object.  all lights were moving at generally the same speed in the aforementioned direction.  the first three lights moved only slightly in relation to each other.  the trailing two lights moved at great speed in relation to each other, where one light moved 270 degrees around the other light in approximately 10 seconds.  the movement was not in a perfect arch, again suggesting the two were no physically connected.  while the trailing lights were performing the 270 degree movement relative to each other, one of the leading green lights became intensely bright relative to the others.  this could best be described as seeing a laser pointer that was suddenly pointed directly at the observer.  this lasted approximately 5 seconds.  lights did not blink and were constant, and their brightness in comparison to each other was similar, with the exception of the sudden brightening of the one object.  light intensity could be described as that of a slightly brighter than a standard green airplane navigation light at approximately 1,000 to 2,000 feet (as compared to known aircraft landing at chs on most any other night).\r\nabsolutely no noise of any kind was heard during the entire sighting.\r\nlights were first seen approximately 45 degrees from directly overhead and it took approximately 60 seconds to move to the corresponding 45 degree angle.  90 degrees were covered in approximately 60 seconds.  the objects were seen for another 90 seconds, moving to the nnw, until they slowly faded from sight.  no additional movement relative to each other was seen at that point.\r\nmany flights go over the house in the direction of charleston international airport.  the direction of these lights was different in that it was 30 degrees to the west of the normal flight pattern to the airport.\r\nsky was clear, no clouds.  no haze was observed.\r\nthe pattern below generally reflects the relative position of each light although there were subtle variations of this during the observation.  the distance from the lead light to the trailing light was the distance from the pinky to the thumb with full spread of fingers at arm’s length when the objects were directly overhead.  the distance from the two trailing lights to each other was approximately the size of a half dollar at arm’s length.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tx\r\n\t\tx\t\t\t\t\t\t\tx\r\nx  \t\t\t\t\t\tx\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \r\ngiven the speed the trailing two objects moved relative to each other, it gave the impression that these objects were not at any appreciable height.  the general speed of the objects across the sky was much slower than an aircraft landing at chs.  a landing aircraft takes approximately 15 seconds to cover the same 90 degree arch these lights covered in 60 seconds.  however, landing aircraft are only visible for approximately 20 to 30 seconds where these lights were visible for 90 plus seconds before they slowly faded into the distance.  that gives the impression these lights were higher in altitude which contradicts the impression of a lower altitude given by the relative movement of the trailing two objects.\r\nmy wife observed the objects for 10 to 15 seconds before calling me outside to see them.  we were the only two witnesses that we know of.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

:d oh and when i think back, since it went overhead exactly the opposite direction i saw it first, there is a small chance that when i first saw it it was moving in a direct line towards me which gave the allusion of no movement. but again. gut instinct and memory tell me it was not moving originally. oh and this literally like just happened so i'm not just like trying to remember it or something haha ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":59432,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0378755,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08302014-0016","longitude":-76.3055144,"occurred":1409456400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1409460171000,"summary":"Very bright white light, with other blinking lights flying low ","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"17601","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Lancaster, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:112485"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Canfield","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We where swimming at my grand parents and i noticed a orange light and i did not see any lights characteristic of a plane so is said \"guy look i think it's a ufo!\" then my dad saw it and so did my grandma, brother, and sister and we saw as it silently moved south to north and turned red and it disappeared behind the trees.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":59431,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.0637584,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08302014-0015","longitude":-80.7376208,"occurred":1409457300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1409459235000,"summary":"Orange light moved s to n and turned red","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"44406","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Canfield, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:112486"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":982}
