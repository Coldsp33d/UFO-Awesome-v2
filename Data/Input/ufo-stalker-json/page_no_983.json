States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My sighting occurred on, or about, april 19, 1979 and involved both my visual sighting and visual and radar sighting from the memphis international airport air traffic control tower (atct). my story begins with a phone call from my best friend on sunday morning april 14 as i recall. he was excited and related the sighting that he had witnessed the previous night while at the southwest twin drive-in theater. he said he had noticed people getting out of their cars at one point during the movie and looking up at the sky. he did likewise and saw 4 red lights moving over the drive in in a square or diamond formation. after the ufos hovered silently over the drive in for a few minutes they suddenly departed at great speed in four different directions. i believe this sighting was reported in the local newspaper.\r\n\r\nmy story:\r\n\r\nat that time i was employed by the memphis-shelby county airport authority as the senior airfield electrician for memphis international airport. at that time i had been working on the airfield for about 3 years and was very familiar with aircraft, on the ground and in the air, both during the day and at night. i also had a close relationship with the controllers in the atct as i interacted with them on a daily basis in the course of maintaining the runway and taxiway lighting systems. for clarification of the story i also need to point out that my wife had just given birth to our first daughter on april 4th and was at home recuperating. at the time we lived about 3 miles southwest of the airport. it was advantageous for me to live close to the airport as i was on call 24 hours in case of any airfield lighting problems.\r\n\r\non the afternoon of april 19 i had arrived home from work about 4:00 pm and shortly thereafter my wife put the baby down for a nap and ask me to be sure to not let anything wake the baby up as she was going to take a well-deserved soak in the tub. i should also point out that i am a licensed amateur radio operator and therefore decided to do a bit of listening to one of my radios to pass the time. i had an air-band vhf radio in the spare bedroom and i turned it on and tuned around the band to listen to the airport tower and local air traffic. i happened upon the west approach frequency for the airport and immediately heard a conversation between the memphis atct and a small beechcraft airplane that was on approach to the airport. the controller on frequency called the pilot of the aircraft and ask if they could see anything off their right wing, which would be to the south. the controller stated that they had received some ufo reports from that direction. the pilot immediately responded that yes, he could see something that appeared as 4 red lights hovering in the distance. the controller responded that they could not see them from the tower but they had requested the memphis police helicopter to check it out and they were in route.  he also stated that they were painting something on radar but could not tell what it was.\r\n\r\nat this time i tuned the radio to the “local” or “tower” frequency which is the frequency used for aircraft on final approach to a runway, as i knew that because of their usual low altitude flight, this was the frequency that the police helicopter monitored. i immediately heard the police helicopter pilot in conversation with another controller in the tower cab regarding the ufo (the previous controller was downstairs in the tracon looking at a radar screen). the pilot stated that they had the ufos in sight and were in position underneath them and making an attempt to get closer by ascending. however, he said that the ufos appeared to be ascending at the same rate as they could not get any closer to them. at this point the tower cab supervisor whom i knew well came up on the frequency and said that they could now see the objects from the tower. as i was located only about 3 miles away to the southwest i thought perhaps if i went out in my driveway i could also see them. this meant however that i could no longer monitor the radio conversation.\r\n\r\ni ran out the screen door onto my carport and out to the driveway and looked to the west and could see three red lights and the police helicopter a distance underneath. the weather conditions were a relatively solid overcast that i would estimate at about 2-3000 ft., perhaps lower. i retrieved my binoculars from my truck and proceeded to stand up on the tailgate of the truck and observe the objects. they appeared as glowing red lights similar to the obstruction lights on a radio tower. the first thing i noticed was the helicopter depart the area, to this day, i still don’t know why, perhaps an emergency call of some sort. i continued observing the objects and noticed the one to my right seemed to me changing color or “strobing” from red to white. it was almost imperceptible at the time but over the course of a few moments it became more pronounced and rapid. suddenly the craft shot off to the right (north) and disappeared at incredible speed. i jerked the binoculars down from my eyes just in time to see it disappear. i cannot say if it disappeared into the clouds or just went out of sight.\r\n\r\nnow if you recall my 1 ½ week old daughter that i was supposed to be listening for was still asleep in the house….At that moment the phone just inside the screen door began ringing and i knew this might wake up the baby and invoke the wrath of my wife so i immediately ran to the door and answered the phone and promptly hung up on the telemarketer on the other end of the line. i ran out to the driveway and looked in the direction of the objects but much to my disappointment, the remaining two were gone. i know this sighting was reported by several people and was covered by the local newspaper. i learned some time later from a mufon investigator that the national enquirer had done a story on it and interviewed the atct supervisor.\r\n\r\nnot a visually incredible sighting but one with good elements of radar confirmation and visual sighting by atct personnel and pilots as well as myself.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

a swig of orange juice.  i had just done that and was going to go back to bed but remembered that the gated parking garage, adjacent to the short “high-rise” condo complex that i live in, was not gated for the past two days.  since i have a vehicle in that lot, and the vehicle is exposed to the street, i decided to take a look out of my living room window, which overlooks the parking lot, to check on my truck.  i had been a little worried about the truck overnight, because we have a ton of auto burglaries on our street, and in general, a lot of scuzzy people walking around up to no good late at night, early a.M.  \r\nin order to get a good look at the parking lot, i had to lie down (on my belly), on my carpet.  we have a large window but the shade is always drawn, so i decided to lie down and look out the window.  truck was fine and i didn’t see anyone around but i noticed some lights on in a dilapidated building kitty corner to ours.  since i wasn’t feeling sleepy, i went and got my binoculars and took a look.  i was checking out the strangely nice furnishings inside of this dilapidated building when “it” happened.\r\ni think i heard the low hum first.  the rest, i am absolutely 100% sure about.  i looked to my left, and a giant rectangular, flat, object was “floating” slowly in my direction from up high – gliding long side up, and then closer and closer.  it sort of “twisted” slowly which was a movement that i found incredulous for any manmade air craft.  it made no sense.  it then hovered for a time (maybe 2 minutes?) and it was “facing” me at a diagonal/slanted  angle.   there was a white light (not blinking) on each corner of the craft.  in the first moments of seeing this thing, my brain was trying to categorize it as an airplane or some kind of military jet and i couldn’t understand why there were only white lights as i know that our aircraft use colored lights to indicate port side or starboard.  then the shape of the object became clear to me – it was so close and so low.  and since it hovered for what seemed like a long time, i had a long time to look at it.  but even so, i feel fuzzy about what it really looked like with specific details.  i know that at the moment i realized it was absolutely a ufo, i was in absolute shock at what i was witnessing.  i thought my binoculars were starting to fog and put them to the side and i think the craft was emitting some kind of glow or steam.  i’m not sure about the foggy part.  … then, it put itself horizontal and glided up, and headed in a northern direction, staying quite low.\r\nmy husband was sleeping in the other room and i didn’t call out for him because i didn’t want to disturb what was happening by making a huge commotion, and even though i wished so badly i could go grab my camera i didn’t want to miss a moment of what i was seeing.\r\nweather:  it was very dark out (for an urban city), and very quiet.  our street actually is not very well lit, which is unusual for the neighborhood.  the sky was dark, but it was clear overhead and i could see off on the northern horizon that there was a heavy band of low fog.  that was the direction the craft took off.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then

received a notice on my google home-screen about the 'perseid meteor shower'. i was intrigued, and began investigating into it and trying to find out peak viewing times. after 22:00 (approx.)me and my family headed out, hopeful of seeing a meteorite. i set up my seating apparatus and sat down with a cup of tea, and watched the pitch black, but cloudy sky. after my family went off to bed, i felt no desire to retire for the evening and stayed on watching the hardly visible stars in the cloudy night sky. with no luck of seeing any meteors. i went in to replenish my tea cup. when i came out, i sat back down for a few minutes. suddenly, i saw what originally looked like a disk, travelling much slower than an aircraft. i'd observed about 30-40 commercial aircraft that night, another family member pointed out and drew attention to the large number of aircrafts, and i agreed. all the airplanes flashed green and red repeatedly, unlike the ufo i was seeing, which looked a lot like something out of the x-files. i looked again, and saw the craft change into a star like object. my eyes were fixated on the craft, that was easily mistakable for a very bright star, and i noticed it was still moving, slower than the speed of an aircraft with no flashing or pulsating lights. it didn't shine any ray of light or a tractor beam, just flew across the sky out of sight. \r\nmy initial reaction was shocked, i was always optimistic about the idea of extra-terrestrial beings, but this was weird. the craft was a very strong white light; easily visible due to the dull lights of the other stars and the close proximity (it was brighter than the moon) of the object i saw that. the object didn't change colour or shape after the transformation between disk and star that night.  \r\nthere were no

working for a quiet town's police department. i lit a cigar and sat on a park bench facing east. for twenty minutes i watched a busy meteor display of shooting stars flowing west to east. at 4:50am, i looked over my right shoulder in a southwest direction. i saw either an elaborate prank or the greatest sighting of my life. just as i looked over my shoulder i observed a dark red \"pinwheel\" spinning in the sky. it was up about 65 degrees. as it spun it expanded. it was fixed, stationary. i took my iphone from my pocket and began recording. the event spun, creating an expanding hole in the center. after approximately 10 seconds it closed, leaving behind a cloud. \r\n\r\ntwo minutes later and while still recording, a second event occurred. just below the first event and slightly to my right, a white light appeared inside a small cloud. the light grew as did the cloud. it too ended and left the cloud remnants. \r\n\r\ni called another police officer over. i wanted a witness for any third event. he witnessed only the remnant clouds. \r\n\r\ni replayed the video and could see nothing. later my son played it on his television and we could see the entire event, but it's very

foot wide and white in colour) come from the side of the house. it crossed the neighbors back yard across the street and the next neighbors back yard. at the time just thought it was the neighbor with a flashlight but thick cedar trees surround our yards. went around the corner of my house and didn't see anything so i went back to bed. the next morning my wife and i were having morning coffee on

of the fur was right where i saw the light come through the trees just 6 hours earlier. the neighbors white rabbit wasn't in it's cage and the type of cage it was in the door was in the top and they had a 5lb rock on it to keep it closed. the rock when i took the pictures was still on the cage or put back? the funny thing is there was white fur everywhere but no blood on anything? the white fur/grass,nowhere! as i followed the trail of fur from their yard to ours(20-25 feet) at the end of the trail in our yard found the rabbit's lower jaw bone with the teeth.(still have some fur and the jaw bone.) the funny thing is the neighbors weren't around and the next day they packed up and left without a word to anybody! being their ground floor bedroom window was 3 feet above the rabbit's

in a strip of farm land known locally as the \"cotton flats\". there were angular clouds that come when fog is about to set in.  there was a sudden series of flashes that i thought was lightning at first to the southeast of my position.  i quickly realized that it was green and blue and all hews in between and couldn't be. i slowed the vehicle down and started realizing that the clouds were starting to glow with lights that seemed to be scanning outward. then the object/objects lowered beneath the cloud radiating still from blue to green and back again. it was two lines of circular (maybe slightly oval) lights in two parallel lines. i am awful with depth perception so the size (though cover a significant amount of space in the sky) would be impossible to accurately guess.  the lines would hover and then shift attitude ccontinuing the light show.  i was slowing down more and trying to reach for my phone in the floorboard to take a shot of it.  then the lights at the top of the parallel lines got closer together while the ones incthe back pinwheeled further apart.  both lines stayed straight but were at approximately 45 degee angles of each other.Then, they took off. i am not sure how to discribe this. it didnt fade away or simply disappear butit pointed ti the southeast and then jus went. it was so fast, my eyes peceived it like acloud of lights vanishing like a fast car would leave dust floating where it had been.  i thought i had lost my mind.  i travel another five to ten minutes south on 43 and begin coming inti russellville. it reappeared.  i grabbed my phone, got the camera pulled up continued driving and tried to snap a photo. i thought it had disappeared befire i could catch it on film but i managed to capture a streak of blue on the middle of the sky at the left center of the photograph.  that is basically it.  i sincerely though i had lost my mind after a long day on the road until i saw it the second time and caught that streak of light on the photo.  thanks for giving me a place to tell my story. i would love if you can explain this

it seem odd. so we were just out there smoking and i noticed two oddly colored lights single orange red colored balls or what they seemed to be from a distance. the two objects flew in a formation  from the southwest but not how you would see two planes flying one was higher in the sky and the other was lower and seemed to be leading the higher object. they both stopped and seemed to hover still in the odd formation about a minute passed and we were trying to make sense of it when the higher object started moving west while the other was still hovering. the object flying west suddenly made a what i would say and impossible turn and was heading directly to the east and seemed to be coming right for us. all four of us were pointing and being loud at this point and it just came faster and faster. then it no longer had an orange reddish light it had two white lights underneath it the closer it came the bigger it got about a minute or so it was moving in the same direction and went right above us all where we all saw three white lights two in the back and one in the front there was no clear outline of the shape but the lights underneath gives me the idea it was triangular. when it was above us it seemed to be moving slower then before and shortly after it passed over us the two rear lights got bright and shot off east to the blue mountains. the lights were gone within a couple blinks of an eye after the lights got brighter. we all were in aw when we looked back to where the other object had seemed to be hovering and we saw the orange ish light and it just faded and was gone

 they were moving east at a high rate of speed.  it caught my attention because with the tv on stars and planes aren't usually visible.  the first object had an unusually bright white light shining that i assumed to be either landing lights of a plane or perhaps a searchlight from a helicopter.  i thought that was confirmed when the secnd object stopped and appeared to hover while the fist oject continued off to the east until it disappeared from view. \r\n\r\nas i watched the second objct hover it started flashing from a brilliant white to red to blue.  at this point i'm thinking it is a police helicopter or something.  just as i was about to lose interest, it zig zagged downward.  watching a little more, it slowly rose in the air then zig zagged downward the opposite direction.  it then rose again and appeared to make a circle in the sky.  at this point i began to wonder if my eyes were just playing tricks on me.  i woke my mother and she observed the same behaviour.  the object spent probably 20 minutes slowly rising or lowering only to zip around back to where it started.  \r\n\r\napproimatey 10 or 15 minutes into both of us watching this thing, we became aware of what looked like extremely frequent flashes of lightening to the northwest.  i don't know if it is in any way related, but ther was no thunder or sound at all associated with either the object or lightening.  \r\n\r\nabout 30 minutes into the sighting, we both observed that the object appeared to heading north at about a 10 to 20 degree incline.  it took a good 15 minutes to disappear from

birds at first or maybe a trail from a jet or plane.  but when i watched it it was perfectly rounded on the leading edge, which was slightly darker and the only aspect of it that gave it away. it was also very high.  it was almost invisible if it wasn't for the leading edge.  when watching it it did appear that there was more to it than just the leading edge.  its hard to describe but it was a little blurry behind it.  it was flying almost directly from the north to the south.  it was a little cloudy and i lost sight of it after about 30 seconds.  i know that i have never seen anything like it before. i am unable to explain it that is why i am reporting it here. i did some research on the web. most of the images i found were triangles. but i found one image that is identical to what i

little clouds in the area. we were looking at the stars and planes and watching for unusual stuff bc last week we had seen something that peaked our interest.
