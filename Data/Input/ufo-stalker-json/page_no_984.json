husband,daughter andyself were standing outside watching the meteor shower.. at approx 10pm my husband spotted a large object in the northern sky , it was triangular in shape and had white lights at each point..The lights were bright and lit up the underbelly of the craft..So much so that you could see a metallic reflection...It moved eastward.. going very slowly and it wasn't very high ( not as high as an airplane) and it was completely silent..All 3 of us witnessed the craft and watched it move slowly across the sky until it disappeared behind the tree line..Then a few mornings later at approx 615am while my daughter and son were standing outside to catch the school bus my daughter and son witnessed 2 oval shape crafts that were connected side by side ( they said it looked similar to the infinity symbol) they ran inside to get me ..I ran outside and witnessed the connected ovals and watched as they hovered then moved northwest .The craft was very large and silent.. it moved swiftly but strangely sideways.. as the craft continued north west it changed shape and went from 2 connected ovals to two connected slits before completely disappearing ...I can't describe the color but it looked textured in a scense and metallic like...My children were completely terrified and freaking out.This event lasted approx 3minutes...Then a few nights ago my husband was outside at approx 10pm he screamed for me to come outside with my phone camera..I ran outside and looked up and directly over our heads, maybe 200ft was a single huge bright light..It moved north to south and it was pretty low..The light was bright but didn't seem to project light..It was like this bright burning white light contained within itself... it moved slowly straight over our heads then sped up quite a bit them the light simply dulled in and out then faded away..It disappeared..The sky was crystal clear each night of the 3 sightings...My daughter witnessed all 3 as well..And its the strangest thing..During these past 2 weeks  we have been noticing these flashing strobing lights in the sky..At first i thought maybe lightening or fireworks or the cell phone tower close by..But the strobes and flashes vary in brightness..And they come from all directions.. we can't find or pinpoint where the lights are originating from..Sometimes the strobes will be quick and so bright other times its more dull...The sky has been crystal clear...We are starting to get a little freaked out..What we've seen may very well be nothing out of the ordinary but to us its strange..We see planes, jets and helicopters all the time and even see the occasional hot air balloon..But this is different...Words can't describe it..We are all just in amazement and a little fear ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

for fear of ridicule. on the night it happened, it was approximately 8:30-9:30 pm, it was in the fall, because we had the windows up to brace from the cold. we were returning from my grandparents farm in independence ky, traveling east on columbia parkway, we had just crossed north, over the ohio river, and turned east onto the parkway, as we turned right/east exiting the bridge, i noticed an unusual light in the sky to the west. i continued to watch it as we traveled east on the parkway, it seemed to be following the path of the river, moving slowly over the northern ky, shoreline. it got closer and i pointed it out to my brothers-(one 5 years younger, one, one year older), and sister(one year younger),i was between 7-12, as we watched it, it changed colors several times-(i was sure it was not an airplane because it was too slow, and at the close distance would have over-taken us, not a helicopter, because it was without sound-(we had by now rolled down the windows to watch it). by now my mother had also noticed it, as we became parallel with it as we drove, she then pulled over so we could get a better look. i did notice as we stopped, several other cars were also stopped along the parkway watching it also. when we got out of the car, it seemed to have slowed quite a bit, by now it was almost hovering, we were at the side of the road,(right), in the eastbound lanes, the parkway is situated about 100 feet above the river, on the hillside, the object was directly above the river, maybe 500 ft. over the water, and the same distance from us (500ft). it had no sound, and my mother said it was a blimp, but the shape was such, that it couldn't be, it was almost rectangular, but had sharp edges to the outside of it, more resembling a building of sorts, and it was, judging from the distance, approximately, 150-200ft in length, on the bottom \"layer\", and 200-240 feet in length on the second layer, the top was hard to judge, and seemed to change shape, the center had what appeared to be windows running half the length of the ship, starting at 30 feet from the front, and ending 30 feet from the end, centered on the object, they were the height of the center \"deck\". at first they were illuminated in blue light, after a few minutes, they went dark-or shadowed, at that time, we could clearly see there was what appeared to be \"people\" moving around in the windows, at this time it was stationary over the river, and changed colors several times, it also appeared to change the shape of the exterior somewhat as the lights changed. it was a very clear with, no clouds, and it was about 100 yards to east of us , still at 500 feet above the river, by now there was at least 4 other cars along the eastbound side of the road also watching it, the size was immense, i thought to look down, to find an object to compare it to, there were no buildings in the area, but there was a barge (single one) being pushed west on the river slightly past the object, the object at that distance was at least 3 times its length, the barge being about 80-100ft. it moved very slowly, on a north-easterly path, seeming to follow the curvature of the river, this too 20-30 minutes as we watched, when it was about 1/2 mile away, it changed direction to a more northerly path, and continued north-east until it went over the hills behind us and out of sight. i have never forgotten this, and seeing recent sightings reported, and being of an age now that i no longer care what people think, i hoped more people would recall, or reported it then, i was too young to make a report myself, and my mother lost interest, (as far as i can recall). one more thing, my youngest brother recently told me he has \"time loss\" in his memory of the event-i don't recall anything like that-it just increased my interest in the event, having read other peoples stories. i intent to speak with my family at length, and gather all the information i can, at this time i was hoping there might be another report form that time frame, so i can pinpoint the date, and find more information on the incident.","distance":"101-500

the rode in order to continue to watch the ufo. at that point the ufo began to silently descend behind the mountain. although i realized that i had seen a ufo, i was visibly shaken by the experience. after processing this occurrence, it made little difference if others did not believe in ufo's because i believed.   \r\n\r\nthe ufo was the proverbial saucer shape with a dome on top and a red glow emitting from the underside. in 1969 an article appeared in the florence times - tri cities daily describing a ufo that a retired draftsman had seen hovering over what is now the university of north alabama. the article included a drawing (to scale) of what the man had seen. to my amazement, it was the same object that i had observed the year before. i do not remember the gentleman's name but

were driving west down the road, and he's driving i'm sitting passenger in his truck (2 door). country like area coming into the city limits, corn fields, small local airport on the left, like small enough for just crop dusters and personal aircraft. well we're driving up on the airport breaking the tree line and the airport is on the left and as you start to pass right in front of the airport you can start to see the local school bus garage also on the left, houses on the right. so this is when the next 2 minutes seems like a very long time. the bus garage has telephone poles that have lights on them shining down like street lights, parking lot lights, well we just start to see the bus garage and almost at the same exact time we both said to each other \"you see that?\", i said \"yes, dude what is that light?\". the light was like a blue white or white white and it was like an orb/sphere like the light was the craft itself or it was on the front or bottom of the craft and the craft was basically stealth. i personally think the light was the craft itself due to the size which we about the size of a regular size car or maybe one of those giant balls that people get inside of an roll down big hills in and it was just illuminating light on the entirety of its surface (giant glowing orb). it was just hovering almost directly over the bus garage office and i noticed it because it was sitting just about 5-10 feet above the parking lot lights and it was off in color to them as well, the parking lot lights are the yellow/orange/amber color so it immediately stood out, i do not know what made my friend notice it and i don't know if he seen it the entire time as i did because he was driving and had to keep looking back on the road, i couldn't take my eyes away. when i first noticed it i thought right away that it was odd, i felt anxious and started feeling an adrenaline rush just a little bit, i wasn't panicking but the complete opposite, ive always been fascinated with the everything unknown, my friend seemed to be fine also. so as we approached down the road and just as we asked each other if we saw it, it started to slowly float away from over the office building and started moving sw direction towards the open field that sits in between the bus garage and the middle school. it moved really slow too, and is almost like it knew we noticed it an started to move away. just as we were getting the closest to it as we did it was probably about 300 feet away give or take, and we were coming up to a t-intersection in the road, left only, which was nice because it runs parallel to the field so as we seen it start to move i said \"dude, turn left turn left turn left\" and he did. then as we're making the 90° left turn it starts going more south, then stops moving just for a split second, and as my friend was straightening out the wheel, in literally like half a seconds time, it had shot to a mile+ away straight south like it knew we were watching it or following it. but the coolest/weirdest thing about it moving the way it did was that it pretty much jumped, there was no travel path just points a and b and it was at point a, then it was at point b, it was like a magnetic gravity pull or like it opened up a tiny jump portal an just popped out a mile away, like the movie \"jumper\". i clearly remember the space the stars the lighting right in front of the light looking almost twisted/warped like it was altering time space as it was opening the jump hole. the only one thought that i had in my head besides wow and the jaw dropping expression i had stuck on my face was confusion, i was literally confused, that's the only sense my brain could make of this event and also i had an instant headache like as if it actually hurt my brain trying to compute what it was that it just seen, thus the confused feeling. after that, we lost it, and we turned right and continued on our way talking about it. i said flat out that it was a genuine ufo sighting, he still to this day says that it was a government aircraft they were testing due to the proximity of a well known hot spot afb just in the next state over. didn't have any camera or anything like that, i really wish i did though. i have never seen anything like it before or since that moment and it just couldn't be anything natural or man made in my opinion.

sighting\r\ndate: i am sorry to have not recalled the specific date of this occurrence. it was roughly between august 2012 – november 2012.\r\ntime: approximately between 12noon-3pm\r\nduration of sighting (before my departure): 4-6 minutes\r\nshape: metallic oval-disc\r\n\r\n\tmy location started at the east end of downtown ojai. there were no visual obstructions in my view. i am a person with 20/20 vision.  approximate location of ufo was above and possibly slightly behind a mountain ridge of north-east ojai valley. the distance between the object and myself, judging east downtown ojai to the mountain ridge it hovered above, is approximately 2 to 2.5 miles. the objects size from my perspective could have been from 100 ft long and 20 ft tall  to 300 ft long and 60ft tall. it appeared to hover above, either directly above or back and above, the mountain ridge. there was a very slight distance between the object and the mountain ridge at about a 16th of an inch, if i were to hold my forefinger and thumb to measure from my location.\r\n\r\nit was a clear sunny day without a cloud in the sky. i was walking down the sidewalk looking at the scenery along the ojai valley mountain range. my first observance was spotting something metallic, noticing sun reflection on its surface. my first impression was that is was either an airplane or a satellite dish. there are airplanes in flight traffic pattern in the east end sky of ojai valley. however, as i noticed it was not moving along the mountain ridge or diminishing or growing in size, i knew it could not be an airplane. i then, thought maybe it’s a blimp, but again, it was not moving in any direction, just fixed. also, the shape was very much more oval or disc shaped to be a blimp. so, then i presumed it to be a satellite dish i hadn’t noticed before. i did think it seemed much too large to be a satellite dish atop a mountain ridge at that distance. i simply came to the conclusion that that is what it must be, a satellite dish. so, then i got to my car, proceeding to drive in the opposite direction, still observing it and wondering about it, since it had such a mysterious and odd looking presence. \r\n\r\nthe next day i was in the same area, i remembered where i had seen the supposed satellite dish. i kept looking and looking along the mountain ridges. it wasn’t there anymore. i thought “no way, it couldn’t be what i think it is.” i have been going over and over in my mind about this sighting. i tend to take a scientific approach to things. i thought, there can’t be any denying it, it has to have been a ufo. i have heard from others in the ojai valley that they had had some experiences of the ufo or extraterrestrial kind, though not sounding as clear and present as my sighting. i had never had an encounter of this sort before. even though i knew it was possible, i thought it had to be impossible to happen to me. i do believe there are other technologically advanced life forms in our universe. the age of the universe and the time it has taken for us, alone, to develop to what we are today and know what we can be capable of, is a good enough ratio of time for others to have developed far and beyond what we have accomplished or can imagine. this is a chance for me to add to the plethora of genuine and growing evidence out there. i wanted to finally share this to help to bring awareness that there are other beings and forces out there and around us. i believe that there are those that would harm us, but also those that wish to aid us. hopefully someday we will all be able to witness and know the truth that has been so well kept through deception and secrecy. as for my account you can take it or leave it. i simply would like to add my observance to the collective. i hope that this will help for further investigation or for confirmation of other eyewitness accounts in this area and beyond.\r\n\r\npeace be with you.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

stars do not disappear like that. i immediately called my friend to tell him that i had saw the object again because he had seen it first, and then i saw it twice all within a week. it seems that

house) was black. i was at home and i walked out my back door and picked a tomato off a patio plant.  i then walked to the fence on my right and tossed the tomato over it, for the birds. \r\n\r\nwhen i turned around, i saw a large orange/red glowing object that reminded me of a burning ember from a fire, very bright.  my first thought was obviously, \"what is that?!\", my second thought was that it looked like \"a jellyfish on fire\".  \r\n\r\nit came from over top of the neighbor's lower roof (which is probably 10 feet high), moving steadily toward the southeast, through our backyard. it seemed to move right through trees/leaves - if it navigated around them, i didn't notice that.  there was no sound, no smell, no anything.\r\n\r\nit appeared to be tranlucent with fire inside of it (or like churning gas), and at some point i saw a clear edge to it - i remember thinking i could see through it, if it weren't for all that fire inside.  when i say it looked like a jellyfish, it was the shape of a contracted, bell-shaped jellyfish.  it was approximately 6 feet off the ground moving through the backyard, and i was only about 10 feet from it at one point.  i estimate the size to be 8 feet tall by 5 feet wide.  \r\n\r\nit moved at a pace like a fast walk, but steady.  i screamed for my husband, who ran out the back door.  i was running to the side of the house, pointing and yelling, \"do you see it?!\" my husband ran past me to the side yard.  \r\n\r\nmy husband only saw the bright orange glow, not the object itself, because there were trees blocking his view of it by the time he got there.  \r\n\r\nknowing i would lose sight of it on that side, i ran to the other side of the backyard (where i had thrown the tomato over the fence).  i was expecting to see it clear the front of the house, low to the ground like i just saw.  i saw it in the sky over the houses across the street, climbing higher in the sky - it must have climbed pretty fast because it was only about 6 feet off the ground in the backyard, now it was way above the trees on the other side of the street.  \r\n\r\nwhile i was watching it from the backyard, my husband ran in the house, grabbed his phone and ran out the garage door.  in the backyard, the tree leaves were now blocking my view, so i ran through the house and out the garage door too.  the object had been in the east/southeast sky at about helipcopter altitude, when i saw it from the backyard.  by the time i ran out front (only a matter of seconds), it was now in the southwest sky and very high up, where planes fly. we continued to watch it climb higher and higher until it was a bright glowing orange dot and then dissappeared.\r\n\r\nwhen i saw it, i wasn't scared - more amazed and curious than anything.  i walked/ran toward it.  i know i saw something - in the days since i saw it, i've tried to reason away the sighting, but there is no other explanation.  i looked at those memory lanterns people are sending up and while the shape was similar, the glowing intense color and size are all wrong.  if it was a man-made article, like one of those lanterns, it would have gotten caught on something (trees, limbs, bushes, fences) as it passed through the yard. \r\n\r\nour nextdoor neighbor was driving toward home at that time and saw a bright orange glow coming from our backyards.\r\n\r\nmy husband took a picture with his cell phone camera, but all it shows is red/orange on the entire frame.

the description of the orbs one man seen is very similar and also i think about the sighting all the time. also i dont remember the exact date but i was a junior in high school and we were on our summer break and my best friend and i were coming home from a weekend of camping at rock dam campground. and the exact spot we seen it is if you were to leave rock dam due west you will come to highway h, we turned right onto highway h which would put us heading north on h. that is all county forest area. and after we headed north onto county highway h there is a series of curves in the road, and right after the 3rd curve whammmm these two orbs of light came from the left hand side of the road, and my buddy hit the brakes and turned white as a sheet and yelled \"what the ****\" and i was speechless as the two orbs hovered in the middle of the road (we were stopped) and these things were very, very bright hovering 10 feet above the road and i bet they were no more than 15-20 feet in front of the car. they did not hover long, and zinggg they shot off into the night sky heading north east above the tree tops very fast...It was intense and i think about it all the time, and my friend and i couldnt even do anything but we looked each other in the eye and i asked him \"did that really just happen?\" and he was still pale white (im sure i was too) and i bring it up to him or he brings it up to me from time to time to this day and we both remember it like it was yesterday. changed us forever because we have without any doubt seen something from another world, thats about it i just thought i would share our experience so you can document the location, i have nothing to gain from this but figured it could in some way help you guys out....This was before the days of cell phones so unfortunately no photo but it would of been one hell of a photo because they were so damn close...I feel very lucky to have actually seen this, and will take that night to my grave with me as it is still very vivid in my mind.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

large object that was pulsing multiple colors of light.  it seemed to climb then descend very rapidly as well as moving back and forth in quick bursts. after each series of movements it seemed to hold its position in the sky.  after about 15 minutes we noticed a shooting star streak across the sky. less than 30 seconds afterwords another smaller object started to rise above the treeline pulsating different colors just like the first. it was much smaller but made the same type of movements as the first. the large object started to climb and remained in a fixed position  as we noticed more shooting stars and objects begin to appear about 15-20 minutes apart.  the other objects were spread from ne across the east to the southern sky. they seemed to reach certain positions in the sky and stay there. after a while the colored lights seemed to stop and became like stars in the sky the largest object was the first to do this and the others followed suit in the next hour. the positions that they seemingly disappeared at were in line with stars in the sky. the last object stopped changing colors and disappeared around 4 am.  the strangest part of the sighting was the lack of planes in the sky. only one plane crossed about halfway through the event. it seemed to change course when it got closer to the objects and move away from them. the area we live in usually has a large amount of commercial air traffic and there are usually 3-4 planes in the sky at any given time. this sighting was the longest i have ever witnessed and by far the strangest sending chills down my spine.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

the sky as i usually do.  there wasn't a cloud in the sky, except for one which appeared back-lit, and which was located between the feet of  orion. \r\n\r\nmy first thought was that this cloud was illuminated by the moon. however, no sooner did i think this when  the cloud began expanding and pulsating with a blue-green, blue-gray, and blue-white light. realizing that this wasn't the moon, my next thought was, \"supernova?\" \r\n\r\nat this point i rushed into the house and yelled for my son to get out of bed and bring his camera, because i had never seen anything like this. in just a few seconds he was on the porch, but was unable to photograph the cloud, because it was already fading.\r\n\r\nas we watched it fade, the same phenomenon occurred in a straight-line trajectory, but further to the south. we continued to watch in the event the same phenomenon would occur a third time. in a way it did, however this time, instead of a cloud, there was a bright white flash, as if a star appeared and then disappeared. if the object or phenomenon repeated a fourth time, i'm unaware due to  any further activity being out of my line of sight. \r\n\r\ni have watched the night sky all my life and have seen many meteors. this was no meteor. likewise, i have seen the occasional light in the sky, and have always explained them away as aircraft, weather balloons, or satellites. i  don't believe those explanations fit this event. the strangeness of it all, and my desire for answers has led me to file this report. \r\n\r\nadditionally, there were two airplanes in the sky during this event, but they were so far removed from where this took place that i don't believe the pilots were associated with this phenomenon. \r\n\r\nat no time did i observe a craft. i  saw only these illuminated clouds and that one flash of light.

in a darkened park where i like to observe stars, meteor showers, etc., when i noticed that the clouds were almost aurora-like...Very high and wispy-thin. i had been out there for about ten minutes, so my night vision was well adjusted. i was randomly scanning the sky when, right before my eyes, nearly directly overhead to the north, i witnessed a star's light suddenly grow/ramp up in intensity until it was brighter than any star or object i have ever observed in the night sky. when it reached it's brightest point, which took about 10 seconds, it stayed that bright for several seconds, then started reverting to it's original brightness, which took about ten seconds as well. i then observed two objects that were dimmer than the \"star's\" original brightness moving from that area going directly west. i tracked one of the objects about halfway across the sky until i couldn't see it any longer because of the city lights. the other light was on a slightly different path, and i lost it behind some of the high wispy clouds. at this point i had feelings of excitement, wonder and disbelief. about seven minutes passed and i was scanning the entire sky in awe/disbelief, when i observed an \"aircraft\", possibly military in nature, coming from the northeast, flying low and very fast.It travelled in the same direction as the light i tracked halfway across the sky, which was west. this \"aircraft\" moved faster than any aircraft i have ever observed at it's lower altitude and it made absolutely no sound. i watched it until it disappeared over the western horizon. the event i observed gives me a strong feeling that i have witnessed some kind of dimensional or intergalactic gateway opening and ushering forth several craft. the military type craft i observed several minutes later may have been in pursuit? i say military craft because i was formerly stationed at a nato air base in italy and currently live between grissom a.F.B. and ft wayne's tactical fighter wing, so seeing a military craft operate at night is well known to me and unmistakeable. i was just shocked at it's speed and it's lack of sound at the altitude it was operating ,maybe 300-500 feet. the craft i observed leaving the \"star\" were very high in the atmosphere... i can't even guess at how high they were. they were very \"starlike\" in appearance.
