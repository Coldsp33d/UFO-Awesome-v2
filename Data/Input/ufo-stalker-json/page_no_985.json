the other side of the woods.  she never goes into the woods in the dark.  i just happened to look up again and the neon green light was back.  i got my phone again and took a couple of pictures, but i couldn't see the green light on my camera screen.  i took a couple of pictures where i thought the light was but they didn't come out...Just black.  my camera needs to focus on something before it takes a picture and i thought it weird that it took a picture of something not on the screen.  the light faded again.  the photos are just black.  i kept calling and calling the dog, and about 2

had made a report a couple years ago that affected me enough to want to tell someone and make it official.\r\n\r\nthe other day, i was out smoking a cigarette on my porch, and had a clear view of the night sky. i noticed what appeared to be a star that was moving in the sky. it moved at a pretty quick pace, equivalent to most airplanes or slightly faster. it was a solid bright light that was not blinking at all like a plane would be.\r\n\r\ni questioned to myself, \"is that a ufo or what?\", and as i said that to myself, i saw a shooting star right where i was focusing on. of course, shooting stars are not something that is unexplainable, but the fact one occurred right near the starlike object as i was asking that question to myself seems like more than a coincidence to me, especially since i don't quite believe in them. \r\n\r\nanyway, back to the starlike object.  it kept moving in a north eastern manner, and i watched it for a good 20 seconds or so before i noticed two air planes with red and white blinking lights moving much faster than most commercial flights do approach from near the tail end of this starlike object.  they were not very close, as the starlike object kept flying in the direction it was before it just \"faded out\" and basically \"disappeared\".\r\n\r\ni watched the two planes, which by the way were flying parallel to each other, and noticed that one of the planes did a full u-turn in the air and started heading back the direction it came from, and the other plane cut off to the \"right\" and flew that direction.  i am really confused as i have never seen any airplanes do any turns in the sky over pennsylvania, especially paired with another aircraft that appeared to be the same type.  \r\n\r\nthese planes were flying quite fast, and the reason i know is because shortly after this ufo disappeared, i saw a third plane that really appeared to be a commercial flight that had different blinking lights and flew much slower than the other two planes, acting as a benchmark for normal plane speeds in my mind at the time.\r\n\r\ni have not really stopped searching for ufo related sightings since my last report on mufon years ago, but this particular event really has sparked my interest in the existence of extra terrestrials even more as of the past couple weeks and i am really hoping we finally get to declassify all the documents and knowledge we really know about the subject as a whole.\r\n\r\nmy honest intuition feels like those planes were trying to chase down a ufo because they flew pretty much right in the air space and direction it was headed... and have any of you ever seen a plane do a complete u-turn and fly back the exact way it came, while another air plane flys off to the right? and add in the shooting star........You decide.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading.\r\n1 step closer.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

snack with a friend. we were discussing the odd ufo events of the previous night (see my previous mufon report). i was also telling her about the low and peculiar cloud cover that seemed unique and persistent. the tone was one of suspicion and concern. \r\n\r\n i looked up, and just over to my left. after almost three months consistent activity (every night with exception to those with a full moon, heavy cloud cover, heavy rain) i see this thing. for just a second i paused to making sure i wasn't hallucinating, and then i pointed out the small uav/drone type ufo to my friend. this object was white and shiny like a new car, and it had a black stripe across the middle. in my estimation, it was approximately 4 foot in length, and had a diameter of 4-6 inches. i did use trees and structures for scope. my friend disagrees with my observation on its size. she believes the ufo to be 8 feet in length (+/-) but agrees that it is too small for a person to pilot. it looked exactly like a common pain relief/supplement capsule (gelatin/gel cap) even bearing such a pill's segment. that segment is where the +/- 6 inch black stripe was located. the object was flying in a perfectly straight direction while maintaining its altitude like a lead weight cutting through water. \r\n\r\n we both instantly became a little nervous and used a few expletives while asking each other what this ufo could possibly be. i've never heard of such a thing, nor had she. it came from the south and flew north. both myself and the other witness lost sight of it in the distance. it was not moving very fast, but it was impressive nonetheless- given its size, lack of visible propulsion/fuel exhaust. we could not agree on its altitude or exact size. we do agree that it was too small to be anything other than a uav/drone. \r\n\r\nmy gut tells me it is a new government or military scouting device that is propelled by antigravity technology. my theory is that it is fitted with technology and software used to \"sniff\" out or particular elements and complex chemicals associated with nuclear, explosive, or illegal narcotics. i had read a report of us military drones being fitted with explosive detecting devices a short while back and being used in the middle east. i doubt that such drones could be used at home domestically without upsetting/intimidating everyone. on its own, and given the lack of informed minds here and abroad regarding technology and the sciences, a ufo we saw did not look like it could harm people. fort campbell and the doe's oak ridge facilities are not that far away. oak ridge reportedly is using their facilities to build the new motors credited to tesla motor co. for myself, this type of thing is a natural/obvious progression of such an equation.\r\n\r\njust a note\r\n\r\nlate last night, i noticed numerous ufos with the same witness as above. these objects were typical in size, shape, and lighting. what i see almost nightly from my home: triangles, disc, orbs, flash. there were two exceptions to what has become the norm that i can note. we heard what seemed like a helicopter, but i could only narrow down a very general direction (se) because the sound was so muffled. it seemed to fool my senses regarding distance, and altitude to full effect. the other thing i am uncertain about. roughly between orion's belt and the pleades constellations the was one of two solid objects. the other similar object was directly in front of the pleades. the both seemed to be a burnt cherry red, very large, and using some sort of light refracting device. i could only find binoculars to see them a bit better, but for those that stargaze, you know what the pleades looks like to the naked eye, and it was all wrong last night. of course, my placement of these objects in the night sky is in relation to my location and time.\r\n\r\nagain, i would love for someone to come out here and record/document all of this. this small area is a hotbed for activity. i am anticipating an email or call.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

with. i was in amazement. this is a space craft a ufo. i just saw a ufo and i could not believe what i had just seen much less how close it was to me. it scared me to putting that truck in gear and hauling it straight back to my job site. i told coworker and i just kept going on and on about it. took me about three hours to settle down and particularly did not want to get back in the truck and go anywhere period. that ufo just went poof gone just disappeared..... it has completely changed my way of thinking and i don't trust the sky. i see  them all over the sky. even when i told people what i have seen they think i have lost it..... no,,, ufo's are very real and many are here. so... next day going back to work i saw that the place the ufo was hovering over is power lines from the power plant. they are every where out there. i saw another last night going off in a straight line and disappeared just like poof it's gone. i was so stunned i did not get my phone to take a picture either but i know what i saw and it has changed my everything about the sky ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

rectangular shaped object with lights circling around it, changing colors. we kept saying, \"what is that?\"  it briefly went totally dark and then reappeared moving toward her property.  her house is situated at an elevation of 1,053 feet above sea level according to my phone.  there is a very steep drop off at the edge of her lawn which is heavily wooded all the way down the mountain.  these objects were high above the trees which are very tall.  as the large object moved closer and closer to us a small semi-circular shaped object was see below the larger object.  i grabbed my cell phone and began taking photos of what we were seeing.  it came close enough to her lawn to reflect light onto the grass.  then the semi-circular shaped object straightened itself out, as is seen in the photo, and flew at a speed i've never seen anything move with out of our sight behind trees.  it did not return that we saw.  the large object began getting very bright with almost fiery looking lights shooting out of the ring where the multi-colored lights were first observed.  we watched it for what seemed like a short period of time but we later realized we had been out there watching for about an hour and a half. i have no direct memory of the object leaving or blinking out but it was just gone.  i began to take photos all around in hopes of finding where it went.  that's when i got the very poor photo of what seems to be two little creatures.  also, strangely enough another glowing light appeared deep down in the woods.   it would brighten when we talked to it and dim and then brighten again on request.  my camera never recorded a photo of this object although i snapped them repeatedly.  my friend said once during watching the object she was going to get a flashlight and go out there and look more closely.  i strongly encouraged her not to do that.  i felt that we were fine on the deck where we were but didn't need to be out there any closer.  we were unnaturally calm afterward and even talked about how we just sauntered back inside the house and went to bed - too calm if you ask me.  odd.
