looking towards the south.  there is a large tree to the right of my backyard (southwest).  from behind the tree about 1 ½ km away, about 1 km above the ground the object first came into my line of vision.\r\n\r\nit moved at the speed of a slow moving plane, or helicopter going from south west to south east.  this was no plane or helicopter though.  it was disc shaped and its color was orange/red.  it was difficult to make out its exact shape because there was some kind of vapour effect that surrounded it.  kind of looked like it was on fire.  but no flames were visible.  it just had this bright orangy red glow with a fiery mist that trailed behind it and surrounded it.  at first i thought it must have been a meteor.  but meteors don’t move that slow. \r\n\r\nthe object continued at the same speed and headed southwest.  but as it was getting further and more of its back was facing me, its appearance changed.  the orange red colour seemed to fade off and there appeared to be this umbrella-like whiteish swirling vortex that seemed to be coming from the front of the object.  perhaps this vortex was creating its orange red appearance?  \r\n\r\nit continued on its way until i could no longer see it.\r\nthe whole event lasted only a few minutes.  i do not know what it was i saw.  let me be clear though.  i was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  i

to see. i rode my bike until i was directly under it. i was traveling north very slowly on my bike, and the craft was traveling very slowly south  (barely moving in a slow hover mode). \r\n\r\nthe craft body was dark and triangular in shape, and had alternating red and white flashing lights evenly spaced about 2 feet apart all around it on all three sides. the nose of the craft had a dished out area that contained a high beam light. i could see the beam reaching up into the night sky. the light seemed to have the ability to turn as if it was searching the sky.\r\n\r\nthe body of the craft was for the most part just a dark colored area surrounded by the flashing lights. i really couldn’t make out any specific details. while i looked up at the craft i first thought it must be some kind of new helicopter (because it was so low and so slow moving, and the almost familiar flutter sound of the engine), but it was not shaped like any helicopter i had ever seen before, nor like any other aircraft i had ever seen before.\r\n\r\ni took my eyes off of the craft for maybe a second or two to turn my bike around (from going north to going south to stay under the craft), and that moment the craft was gone. it was a completely clear night, i could see the stars in all directions, and there was not a single aircraft in the sky. at that moment i was convinced that what i had just seen was no ordinary aircraft. again, it was like looking at a school bus sitting in an open field maybe 100 feet away, and then with a blink your eyes it is completely gone.\r\n\r\ni rode my bike around for a while to see if i could spot it again, but no luck. i saw a couple walking together and asked them if they had seen anything unusual in the sky, they said know. \r\n\r\nwhen i got home i called the local police department (mpd) to inquire if anyone had called in to report seeing anything unusual in the sky. the lady i talked to said no, and asked why. i told her what i had seen and she sounded interested, but i’m sure she probably thought i was a nut…i felt like one just telling her the story.\r\n\r\ni also tried to call the local airport control tower, but got a recording that they closed at 9 pm.\r\n\r\nthe next morning i called the airport control tower again, and was put in contact with the lady who was on duty that night. i told her my story, and asked if she knew of any aircraft that might come close to that description that would fly in our general area? she advised me that there were a few craft in the sky before 9 pm, but nothing at all recorded after 9 pm, and nothing at all at any time traveling north to south. she seemed interested, so we chatted about it for a few minutes. she mentioned that a nearby air force base had a lot of traffic going in and out of it, but i’m not sure what ‘nearby’ air force base she is talking about?\r\n\r\n\r\nattached is a rough draft of the shape of the craft using my paint shop software, but the corners of the craft were more rounded (not sharp angles as depicted in the drawing. the circle in the front represents the flood light that i saw there.\r\n\r\n[name, address, phone number, and email removed/cms/tg]\r\n\r\nnote: over the next few days i mentioned my experience to a few of my close friends (including my priest), but only my friend '[name removed/cms/tg]' (who i have know for about 40 years) believed me. i told my priest as we were chatting just before giving my confession. he smiled at me and kind of shrugged his shoulders as if to say ‘ok, if you say so’.\r\n\r\nsince then i have learned that few people are ever going to take such a story seriously. no wonder people are hesitant to share their stories.\r\n\r\nas a professional photographer i always have a camera close by, what a time not to have one. a week after the incident i did a lot of research on the best camera to use to take such photos, especially at night. the canon vixia hfg10 seemed to be the best bet, but they retail for $1499.00…i bought one anyway. since then i have hoped to be able to maybe see that craft again so that i can photograph it.\r\n\r\nin my opinion the craft i saw was probably something new the military was working on. if it were extraterrestrial, why would they have red and white id marker lights all around it?\r\n","distance":"101-500

our bedroom to observe the constellations.  i saw the object when i got to the slider. the door and drapes were open about 4 inches. it was a very strange o ject. consistent with the proportion of a hockey puck in height and width 30 to 40 feet across. exactly half glowed red like neon, the other half blue with a row of intensely bright white lights the entire width like a string of pearls. these lights operated independently from each other and appeared to be moving and focusing on different areas, one came to rest on me. so bright i had to close my eyes. as i was standing there watching it my husband came up behind me and asked what i was doing. in my head i'm jumping up and down in excitement yelling ufo ufo! but what came out of my mouth was \"lights\". my jaw was stiff and i couldn't open it. i couldn't move. i had no control over voluntary movement. i could only stand there. my husband turned around and left the room. the object started moving very slowly then to the north west.  it was moving slowly enough i could have kept up by running. when it crossed past our property into our neighbors it was obscured by their huge cherry tree. there was a huge flash of light and i could move again. i found i was standing at the railing of the deck but couldn't remember walking there. when i realized i had control again i tore down the deck to the kithen and grabbed the camara. the object was at about 500 ft then. i took several pictures making sure i got the corner of the house in the shot for size comparison. from that altitude it became obvious it was delta shaped and the red/blue division was the apex of the triangle. as it was lazily moving forward it was also slowly turning in place. the third edge was completely dark. on its bottom  there were large lights in each corner with 1 light between them on the edge and 1 light directly 8 in the middle. when i took the film in to get it developed i gave them special instructions to print all frames even if they came out dark. when i picked up the pictures the negatives had been cut into pieces with several missing, and there were no printed pictures of\r\nthe ufo. later that day i was talking to a friend on the phone about it and made the comment \"well no black helicopter\" and laughed. a week later i was mowing the back lawn and heard the womp, womp, womp of a helicopter. i turned around and hovering over our house was a black unmarked helicopter.  no insignia what so ever. it was a chinook type. no numbers, no letters side or bottom. it hovered there until it was quite sure i saw it then slowly backed up until it was out of sight. our property was on a steep hill so i was looking up toward the house. this really shook me up. even more than the ufo. we suddenly had trouble getting our mail after living there 10 years. got calls from creditors wanting to know if we'd moved because our mail was returned. received notices saying they had received notices from the post office saying there was a difficulty in delivering our mail. problems with the phone. there was so much weirdness going on the stress was making me feel nuts.","distance":"101-500

dark outside yet. i was looking around while they finished their business and noticed due north, a bright red, very low object traveling slowly due east. it was quite low, which is why it caught my eye. we have a major airport about fifteen minutes away so we see a good number of planes on a regular basis. however, they are all quite high in the sky and they make a slight noise. i first thought perhaps this was an airplane in trouble but it wasn't large enough and i couldn't hear any noise. also, the planes we see follow a north-south route, they don't fly east to west.\r\n\r\ni watched it travel east, then it abruptly reversed direction and headed west. at that point it rose higher into the sky, then changed direction again to travel east. i lost sight of it because of large trees in our yard. i had my mobil phone with me and set it on video in case it came back around. it did and i trained my camera on it as it made the same east to west, higher then lower, moves. i was ecstatic that i was filming it, then realized that i hadn't pushed the record button. i have never used the video feature before and didn't know i had to do that. i was able to snap two pictures but you can barely see it and it looks white, not red in the photos.\r\n\r\nthe entire viewing was about 3-4 minutes and after it turned west again for the last time, it simply disappeared. it looked like its lights just went out. i don't know but i am estimating that it was perhaps a mile or so from our house. the dogs didn't react as it wasn't visible if you weren't standing up looking past our fence and trees.\r\n\r\nit was quite unnerving and a bit exciting but i truly did not want it to change directions and move towards our house.  after it disappeared i waited about five minutes to see if it returned but it didn't. i wondered if it could've been some sort of drone but i know nothing about how they operate or if they have lights or are legal in neighborhoods, etc.\r\n\r\nover the years, i

knightsen ca,just past oakley.Around 1:00 am,everyone was sleeping,i got bored and decided to go to pittsburg and pick up a friend and show him this house,it was a mansion,with an equestrian center in backyard.I pick up my friend,and it's about a 30 min ride there and back,so,we get into knightsen,and it's a long straight road,about a mile long,and all of a sudden right in the middle of the road,in front of us,these red lights flashed across the road,back and forth,like it was a train crossing,but no bells or train,i'm heading straight at it and it's coming no closer,and i'm really nervous,going faster and can't catch up to it.Then it's gone,my friend said,did you see that,yes,i had to pull over he was getting car sick.So we get back in the car,and headed for the house.Long story short,when i was driving,we kept passing this catfish pond,i found this payphone and called the house,told my girlfriend i can't find the house,she asked.Where i was,i said post office,she said i was right around the corner,and i look up and i see the bright lights from the equestrian center.We finally get to the house at 5:30 am,from 1:00 am.That's a 4hr time

approaching the intersection near my home and noticed bright lights up ahead near the gas station. i first believed it was a plane or helicopter and thought that it was strange for anything to be that low to the ground and since it was not moving i thought helicopter, and on second thought i thought the gas station might have been doing construction on their roof. i pulled up to the light and realized it was not a helicopter or construction. i looked at the clock, it was 12:03 and i immediately turned off the radio and air condition and rolled my windows down to get a better view. i grabbed for my phone immediately to take a photo and it would not work i attempted to power it back on, when just a few minutes prior i had full battery and the phone was operational. the thought in my head was this is a million dollar photo and i have to get it! it was off. dead. i was freaking out and looked around the intersection to see if other cars were around to take notice. nobody was around. my light was red so i hung out of my window in awe. the craft was triangular with 3 white dishes of the purest most brightest  beautiful white light i have ever seen. the light appeared to be contained within the dishes and there was no sign of illumination below or around it. the triangular shape of the 3 dishes if on an airplane would signify that the craft was facing east. i was heading south. the white dishes that glowed appeared to be what quartz crystal looks like when it is activated by frequency. glowing, bright within itself. the three large dishes took up a lot of the bottom side of the craft and in the center of the 3 lights was a tiny blinking red light. i noticed the craft was made out of some non reflective black metal or so it appeared and there was detailed engraving like lines on it. i was more focused on the lights. the creepy thing about this whole experience was that the craft was silent. you could hear the summer breeze and nothing else. the sound must have been out my hearing range. keep in mind the craft was so low to the roof of the gas station that if you were at the gas station and looked up you would not have seen it.\r\n\r\nmy light turns green. nobody is around so i begin to idle through the light still hanging out of my window watching in shock. moving at about 3 mile an hour i get half way through the intersection when the craft begins to move what appears to be backwards, along the road with me at about 5 feet above the telephone wires. now i am more scared. freaking out, i know my house street is a few hundred feet ahead on the right. i contemplate turning home or keep going. i was so scared that there was a possibility that i might not return so i decide not to chance it. still to this day i wish i would have. they were obviously aware of me. so myself and the craft are moving slowly down the main road and i reach my street where i turn on praying i can see it from my driveway. i turn and the craft keeps going. i am home and shaking. i cut the power to my vehicle and every light on my dashboard illuminates. not realizing what was going on with it i jump out of the car and look into the sky to see if i can see it. my headlights remain on. i run inside nervous, panicked and scared and my folks are asleep. i run upstairs to my room and to calm myself down i turn the television on for background noise so i can collect my thoughts on what the hell just had happened. this is eery. possibly a coincidence i think otherwise. the television is on nick at nite and home improvement is on. tim is out back talking to his neighbor. the first noise that comes out of the television when i turned it on was \"so tim, you're telling me you saw a ufo\". right there did me in. i shut the tv off and tried to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nthe next morning i tried calling some friends to let them know what had happened. my phone would not call out. the whole rest of the weekend i could not call out nor could i receive any calls in. i ended up taking my phone to the dealer and they said that it was fried and i had to purchase a brand new one. also, that weekend i had to jump my car every time i was going to use it. never once before had to do that because it was fairly new and in great condition and now in one weekend i had to jump it about 26 times. my father and i took it to the shop monday and they explained that all of the electrical boards and sensors were fried and had to be replaced. \r\n\r\nbetween the television, my phone, my car, and the actual experience i am a true believer of ufos and aliens. also, for a while i was obsessed with getting answers for what had happened to me for some type of closure and some of my research led me to find out that the time \"12:03\" has symbolism meaning of an \"encounter\" strange to me i thought. and it is obvious that they do emit emp from my electrical failures.\r\n\r\nencounter 2: august, 2007\r\nalso, that same summer around 3am, i witnessed a small maybe 4.5 foot creature that was solid snow white and naked jump from a bush to my roof landing in a crouching position where it glared down on me with a snow white owl face. i immediately vacated the premises. keep in mind this is a two story home. so one quick blurry leap at about 30 feet with ease. i prayed that it was an owl and my vision was playing tricks on me, but when i googled white owls they were much smaller than what i saw. my neighbor was with me but the noise of the bush rustling scared her because it was about 12 feet away from us and she never looked to see what it was. i wish she had.\r\n\r\nencounter 3: november 2007\r\nanother encounter had witnesses. it was thanksgiving and a few of my family members noticed white orbs in the back yard. i thought it was car lights reflecting off of the the neighbors windows. my curiosity got me, and i ran outside into the backyard through the snow and the orbs were not near the window, but were in the middle of the yard about 5 feet off of the ground. as i got outside, there was about 6-7 white orbs and they were dancing around each other and one by one, they dissolved and disappeared before i could get a photo. there was about 4 witnesses on this encounter.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Other","flightPath":"Hovering then
