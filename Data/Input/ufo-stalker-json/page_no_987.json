watsonville , ca heading towards monterey. as i approached the moss landing bridge i saw a flash above the power plant's east cooling tower. i pulled off the road on the north side of the bridge. i exited the car and observed the blue-white orb. it traveled at a uniform height due west at about 30mph, at an approximate height of 100ft or about 20ft above the tower. the incident was unique in that as the orb passed over the towers there was a series of 3 bursts that came from the orb. something fell from the orb trailing a white smoke. the object moved due west, out over the ocean through a clear starry sky until it vanished from sight. \r\n\r\ni continued my patrol to pebble beach and drove north again on hwy1. as i again approached moss landing about 1 hour after my previous sigbting, i saw a blue-white orb, about the size of a basketball moving due east at about 100ft. it was coming in from the ocean at about 30mph.\r\n\r\nthere were no bursts or emissions coming from the orb. neither was there any deviation in course or altitude. it entered the coast about 1/2 to 1/4 south of its exit point.\r\n\r\nlater that night the radio discounted the event as a meteorite entering the atmosphere.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

ready to relax. we were just talking and i noticed what appeared to be a pulsating satellite traversing the sky. i didn't think anything of it because i've seen that before. but then the object stopped suddenly. i said to my wife, \"did that satellite just stop moving?\" just as i was, she was perplexed and said, \"uh, yeah.\" she had noticed it, too. then the object began flitting around the patch of sky where it was located. we continued watching for a good half an hour. multiple times i focused on a star near it just in case it was some kind of optical illusion due to temperature variations in the atmosphere. however, the star i focused on appeared perfectly stationary while the other object continued to move randomly in the patch of sky. eventually my wife went inside and within 20 to 30 seconds of when she did, the object quit pulsating for about three minutes  before resuming it's previous activity. i watched for about another 10 minutes before finally accepting that i could not explain what i was seeing. in addition, the next night i made sure to look at the same patch of sky at the same time of the evening to see if there was any celestial object of similar brightness to what we had seen the night before. there was nothing. finally, one last thing that was very odd, at roughly 3 a.M. the night after the sighting, a smoke or carbon monoxide detector began blasting in the cabin. as soon as i got up and out of bed to see what was going on it stopped. i have no idea what we saw the evening before.","distance":"Over One

so) and its bottom was a pure bluish white light, like a halogen lamp in color. it had no wings, rotors, balloon, nor visible engine, so i don't think it was a drone (unless we have antigrav for

begun on tv when my dog began to growl. i had never seen her like that. she had a good nature and was playful. her hair suddenly stood up in a ridge along her back and she was crying and growling at the same time.\r\n\r\nshe jumped off the bed and went to the french door, with windows, that led from the bedroom to the backyard. she didn't paw to go out. instead she sat down and kept growling and crying with her fur raised. she kept shaking her head. i got up to see what what was frightening her.\r\n\r\nwhen i got tot he door i noticed a screeching, buzzing, sound. it was similar to static. the tv blinked and so did the lights. it was actually hurting the dog. \r\n\r\nwhen i looked in the backyard it was just beginning to get dark, but there was still some light out. in the distance, just above the tree tops of the woods behind my house, i saw a circular light. it was hovering. i could tell it wasn't the moon, or anything natural, because it wobbled as it hovered. my dog was staring straight at it and growling viciously. i thought it was odd. i began to stare at it too.\r\n\r\nas i watched, it was as if i couldn't take my eyes away. then i realized we were both unable to move. the static sound got louder but my dog couldn't shake her head. we were frozen in place. i was terrified. i wanted to run only i couldn't. \r\n\r\nthe light changed direction. it fell down through the trees and took a path through the woods toward my house. it wove through the trees and got bigger and brighter. it hurt my eyes. it wasn't stopping it came straight for my door, about six feet off the ground. the light got so bright i thought my eyes would burn. then it was just gone.\r\n\r\ni looked down at my dog. she was in exactly the same spot, drooling, and growling, but softer now. i was dizzy and disoriented. i was as if the light passed straight through us. i sat down on the floor to check my dog and she fell over and laid still, panting as if she'd been running. \r\n\r\nthe whole event seemed a few seconds long. when i looked up at the tv, wheel of fortune was ending. an hour and a half had passed. the world news, the local news, and wheel of fortune had aired. i can't remember one thing during that time.\r\n\r\nwhat is truly strange is that exactly one month later my dog vanished out of my backyard. i had to go out for a while. i left her outside. i had a five foot wooden fence around the yard. it was locked with a padlock. she wasn't a digger. i got home about nine pm and she was gone. the fence was locked. there was no fur on the ground. there were no holes in the yard. no one could have gotten over the fence, with a thirty-five pound dog, without a ladder. she was just gone.\r\n\r\ni miss my dog, but mostly, it bothers me that i have no idea what happened during that time frame. i have severe headaches and strange dreams. i don't like to sleep at night. i have a strange rash all over my body and radiation has been found in the woods behind my house. what happened to me??","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

home. i'm highly intelligent, and have no history of any major medical problems, mental illness, etc.. after this incident happened to me, my health declined dramatically, and my mental well being has now been questioned. when i say this, it is over my decline in health, which a doctor saying to me, you are not going to die!, but you act like it!, yet...All my hospitalizations since, have been legitimate medical reasons. i even had one doctor tell me, if he saw my medical report before and after this incident, he would have guessed me to be about 75 yrs old. yet this whole time...I cannot and have not ever disclosed to anyone what happened that night. it wasent until this morning when i was watching your show on the history channel and saw the story on that young woman in manhattan. i froze in fear! because the same type incident happened to me, only i was not sucked up in any craft.It was in the early morning hours. i'm usually in bed every night before 10am.I cant recall the exact time but i know it was after 1 am, because i do remember picking up my cell phone to look at the time, but then the screen went blank. i heard an apparent running type sound across my roof. i remember laying there very still \"frightened\" because i live alone. my first thought..Maybe a burglar was on my roof, but then i was thinking...Why my roof?? after about 30 seconds a blue beam of light \"lasered\" through my window pointing right on me. i couldn't scream, i couldn't move, almost like in a dream state, and all i could do was lay there paralyzed. the blue beam was directed right at my left rib area ( to this day..I still feel like \"an object\" something that does not belong in my left rib area). no more than about 3 minutes later i heard helicopters, more than one, flying right over my house. i did not have curtains on my blinds, and could clearly see they were flying so low i could see and hear the trees blowing almost like a tornado would. the helicopters were loud, at one point it felt like it was going to land on my roof. they even hovered over my house what felt like an eternity. all i could think inside my thought was...What is going on??...Are my neighbors hearing this too?..Are they able to get up and run out their houses to see what the commotion was??. me..I was paralyzed not only physically but in fear. i laid in my bed till it got light. by now i was able to \"move my body\". i remember saying to myself, should i ask a neighbor did they hear anything??, but i never did. i pretty much keep to myself, especially living alone. i blocked the whole incident out of mind in fear that i would be ridiculed , laughed at, and be labeled as a weirdo. in the next few days, i happened upon the article in my local newspaper \"sightings of black hawk helicopters\" flying low in our area reported!..Was there some military cover up, or flight training...Still a mystery.Regardless...Something was going on, whether it be due to a ufo chase by military, or whatever. you just don't see military flying here in this small town..Period! research my local papers--you will find it! when i saw that, i started to cry..Thank god i'm not the only one who witnessed or heard this.\r\nbut i never voiced my opinion, or told anyone what happened..To this day. all i can tell you...Something defiantly happened to me, this is not something i dreamed up.I

(pt) i went outside to our northern patio in rancho bernardo which has a direct and clear view of escondido, ca to smoke a cigarette and noticed two blazing lights on the horizon.  initially, i thought it was a fire on a hillside in the distance (5 miles or so away) but there are no mountains/hillsides in the area (of where the object hovered) and the \"fire\" was in the sky!  i was shocked.  i yelled for my husband (who had gone to bed) to come quickly and he watched it as well.  by the time (within a minute) he got out to the patio the \"whatever\" had become three lights...Two of them close to each other and the third above the two and to the left (west).  they were very elongated - nothing like a saucer shape and glowing a very bright orange.  looked like the color of fire.  the three had merged into one and then into two a couple of times. i tried to film them with my iphone but they were too far away.  this lasted at least 15-20 minutes and then - when it had merged into one object - disappeared into the clouds. a half hour (or so) later, i couldn't help but notice a weird streak (like a chemtrail in the sky (illuminated by the moon)...And the obvious helicopters coming from the south (towards escondido) to (no doubt) investigate.  today i will upgrade my video stuff and not ever be caught off guard.  this is my third ufo experience.  all three times were in the general area (lake hodges between rancho bernardo and escondido) in 1978, 2012 and last night.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":59274,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.1242468,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08262014-0017","longitude":-117.076831,"occurred":1409028300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1409072620000,"summary":"A blazing light which became three lights over escondido, ca","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Escondido, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:114101"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, 500 Feet or Less","city":"Menifee - Murrieta - Wild","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A pair of bright amber lights hovering in the rural area southwest of where murreta rd meets scott rd. may have also been visible to those in wildomar and the north side of murrieta. \r\n\r\nthe lights were very bright, steady (not pulsating or flashint), and stationary - not typical of the frequent air traffic in the area. \r\n\r\nwe noticed the lights to the southwest when we exited i-215 on newport rd heading westbound. when we reached murrieta rd, we headed south, and approximately 1 mile from scott rd we noticed what appeared to be a thin smoke plume rising from the hills under the lights. it did not appear to be a fire - the point-like lights were visible through the smoke, hovering no more than a few hundred feet above the hills. from that location approximately halfway between scoot and newport, the lights and smoke plume were visible above the hills to the southwest.\r\n\r\nwe considered that people may have been off-roading in the area, but the lights were not typical of how headlights appear at such a distance, they were just too bright and no movement was seen.\r\n\r\nan unidentified helicopter (a frequent sighting in my area) was also seen over the neighborhoods along bradley rd in menifee while the lights were present to the southwest. instead of shining it's searchlight down at the streets (another frequent occurrence around here), the chopper was training its lights horizontally as if trying to spot something else in the air. we lost sight of the chopper and did not see it approach the area where the lights were visible.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":59273,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.786721,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08262014-0016","longitude":-119.4139124,"occurred":1409027400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1409070152000,"summary":"Pair of bright amber lights hovering over rural area","tags":["lights","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files/59273_submitter_file1__StrangeLightsMap.png"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"92584","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Menifee - Murrieta - Wild, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:114102"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":987}
