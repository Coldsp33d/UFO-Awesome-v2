car.  it was foggy that night.  heavy overcast.  visibility limited to 1/2 mile in the valleys.  when about 5 miles outside of dodgeville wi lights were observed about 1 oclock in front of the car.  the craft was large.  it was very eerie also.  there were three lights on the undercarriage of it.  no light was seen in the center of the craft.  the craft was jet black.  it was a 100 feet or more in subtended length.  a point of the triangle faced the car as it approached the craft hovering about 50 feet above the ground, 150 feet off the side of the road.  the craft then rotated and started to follow the car on the side of the highway.  the craft stayed with the vehicle for about 10 seconds until a hill got in between the craft and the car.  of course i started to freak out when this started occurring.  i guess it's notable that this wasn't the first time i've seen a triangular craft, and not the first time witnessing one when driving on the highway.  i guess it's also notable that all the sightings so far have been equally scary. i started kind of crying, partially in anger, partially in fear, as it started to follow me.  it was really scary.  the hair definitely stood up on the back of my neck, and felt a really hollow fear, i guess trepidation mixed with anger is the best explanation.  when the car passed the other side of the hill about 30 seconds later i had speed up to 100/110 mph, and the craft was not there.  i checked the time, and of course no time was lost.  nothing special about the sighting, but i guess i thought it was worth reporting.

all being slow-moving & orb-like.  i was never alone when i had these sightings, & i've never reported them)\r\n\r\nafter watching a movie, i went outside to smoke a cigarette.  i looked at the stars and noticed that one was flickering rather unusually.  i kept my eye on it, and realized that it would slowly move in sporadic directions.  i told my mom to come outside and look at it, mainly to see if she could notice it's slight movement as well.  she thought it was really odd, and went back inside after a few minutes.  me being fascinated with ufo's, i decided i would sit outside for a little while.  about 30 minutes later, i spotted another one further in the distance, and a few minutes later another one (they were most likely blocked off by the tree line, so i couldn't see it before).  i just sat outside in amazement, and didn't really want to miss such a rare opportunity.  after about an hour, i went inside.  about every thirty minutes or so, i would come back outside to check on it.  sure enough, it was still there until the last time i checked - somewhere around 2 in the morning.  by then, it was extremely cloudy.  i could only make out a few stars.  they were either gone, or just hidden by the massive amounts of clouds.\r\n\r\ni'm 100% sure they weren't stars, i could visually see them moving slightly.  i noted their position relative to the stars, and the distance they moved in total didn't match up to the stars, which had barely moved over a course of a few hours.  between the first and last sighting, i would have to say the main ufo moved about 45 degrees across the sky - this being a rough estimation.  i wanted to take pictures of it on my iphone, but it was pitch black and couldn't be spotted through the camera lens.
