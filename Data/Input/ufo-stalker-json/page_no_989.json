seems it was gone no trace of it. at this place on the shoreline is where i have first witnessed this craft . i do have a brief video of this craft. i was closer to this craft when i had first seen it and was able to video it . i am attempting to get more coverage of it since the video is very short. want as many persons aware of this and have the evidence beyond the shadow of doubt. i have to say that in my 55 years on this planet did i ever expect to see anything like this . my mother told me of a story when she and a friend witnessed a cigar shaped thing i shrugged it off thinking i never will see anything like what i have seen two days in a row . i think its starting to make me fear that something is going to happen in the near future . i have been watching t.V. programs that has something to do with this matter . like the roswell rock . this object has been found ten years ago and just hearing about it now( wow) are we slow or what. some may say that these visits from e t may

myself \"what is that?\" and was fixed staring at the objects as they flew directly overhead.  the objects looked kind of dark orange or red with no exterior lights.  the surface looked to have a matt finish and it was hard to pick them out from the black sky. as the objects moved away to the north i felt the hairs on the back of my neck standing up, i had goosebumps and my eyes had filled with tears.  i have never seen anything as clear as that before, something that i could not even explain with alternatives. they were not aircraft that i know of, there was no sound, definitely not birds, they had a solid looking exterior and must have been travelling extremely fast as they traversed the entire sky in less 30 seconds. this experience has left me a little traumatised in that i can not get the image of them out of my head.  i wished that i'd tried to photograph the event but it all happened so fast and also i was mesmerised by their appearance.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"1. a friend and i went outside to smoke since it is not allowed in the house.\r\n\r\n2. immediately, and before my eyes could adjust, i noticed a low flying object directly south of my position, heading in a n,ne direction(front door of house faces south). we moved away from the house, so the indoor lights would not hinder the view of the night sky. at this point, we witnessed two similar objects west of my location. they stayed west of us and proceeded north. i was unable to firm up a decent description or comparison to other ufos seen tonight. they were just a bit to far for my eyes. another single object appeared ne of us. the ufo that i originally observed and this object passed in close proximity (100-200 yards @ same altitude >500ft). two more object of similar fashion could be seen in the far nw and far nne of my location. they flew at a much higher altitude most likely, but at that distance, i am well aware of my skewed field of perception.\r\n\r\n3. my original thoughts when i noticed the ufos was sarcastic. this is the norm in the south graves county sky- flying discs, star-like orbs, other triangle shaped aircraft, along with military or evac/airlift type of helicopters. my sarcasm is also a device to hide a bit of fear from myself. this fear is a result of past experiences that involve extraterrestrial encounters (not abductions events) among other things. i don't want to publish it for all to read. that said, i feel like the us military is piloting the craft i witnessed tonight. if ets are piloting these ufos, they are working alongside the government, not opposing them. nothing about these nightly events suggest a security patrol, a national security threat or operational tactic. my guess is that these are instructional flights to train men and women to pilot new technology. that said, such things make one feel a bit powerless. while i typically see ufo's every night (beginning approx 2.5 - 3 months ago) the exception would be nights with a full moon or overcast. \r\n\r\n4. *motion* regarding tonight's events -as well as all other ufos events- the craft moved in a glider/ghost like fashion. they bank in an odd way, and seem more fluid and agile than any living or built thing in the sky. it reminds me of bob ross' grace with a loaded paintbrush across a fresh canvas. \r\n*sound* likewise, these things are silent until after they have passed overhead and a bit of distance has come between the rear of the craft and myself. it sounds like a rolling jet engine (large commercial engine sound typical of 757) more than anything, but the ufos sing tenor while united airlines sings bass. \r\n*craft lighting* abnormally bright white lights (halogen/led bluish-white are located on the belly of the craft. these lights are bright. the stayed on without any deviance, and just seemed to barely illuminate the body of the craft. in a triangle formation, 3 red lights stood at each angle. unlike all of the the other triangle craft, two of the lights were on either side of the forward moving/front end, while a single light was at the rear. this, along with the slight glimps provided by the white lights, gave the appearance of a triangle. the triangle craft seen previously had one red light at the nose, and two on the ends of the wings. also, the previous triangle craft emitted a glow that i assume is from the burning of fuel, but it was only observable from the rear, and sometimes hard to see if not absent on a few of these craft. tonight, this same glow or light coloration was towards the rear, but not in a standard fighter jet locations. \r\n\r\n5. my feelings regarding tonight's sky along with the other observations i have made equate to frustration, suspicion, and isolated. the isolation is a result of being the one guy alive that simply states the observable-  the emperor is naked. my ex-wife gave me the are you 'okay' bit. so, here i a, seeing unbelievable things all the time without any conversation to really be had, lest i risk appearing crazy. if i had a camera with the proper lenses or access to hq video equipment, i could get over these feelings of helplessness regarding this crazy sky. i have one friend that i can talk to about these things. if she had witnessed several of these events, i would have no one to talk to. when did we quit looking up at the sky?\r\n\r\n6. a few flew out of my line of sight, but frankly it was boring compared to other nights. i just went inside after 30 or so minutes.\r\n\r\nworth noting: a) there seems to be a correlation with these sightings and the tireless barking of neighborhood dogs. the barking sounds like someone or something unwelcomed/unknown is trespassing in every single dogs territory. it's unsettling. b) at the onset of this recent string of events, i, as well as one other observer, noticed the seemingly overnight construction of cellphone type towers that are fitted with elf and gwen technology. i count 7 such towers in our near the city limits. mayfield is very small, and only has a population of 10k. i can only speculate. of course, correlation is not causation, and at this point it is more coincidence. c) frequently ufos will turn off all exterior lights and become invisible from the ground. on these nights, they only seem to turn on lights when in proximity of other craft. the lighting used is star-like in appearance, but they are not orbs. \r\n\r\nmy reasons for the report: \r\n\r\ni hope to hear back from mufon or other persons that have means to conduct a solid investigation by phone or email. i haven't even started to tell what all i have seen regarding both ufo and alien encounters. more than that, i would love for someone that is trusted in this community to come and spend a week or two in mayfield/graves county to investigate my accounts, find other leads/witnesses, but primarily photograph, record, and prove me to be the sane one in a town of zeitgeists.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

1975? ( see below )\r\nduration of siting - 10 minutes approx.\r\nseen by - mother and son \r\n\r\nit was a very cold clear winter evening. the snow was very crunchy and there was no wind. it was probably the winter of 1974/75. i was around 21 yrs old and was out cross country skiing with my mother on her 100 acre farm. we were skiing towards the back of the farm thru the open field with our two dogs. it was full dark, but probably not much later than nine or so as my mom went to bed fairly early.\r\n\r\nabout 3/4 of the way back there was a fence that ran at right angles to our direction. a single row of 20 year old or so trees and bushes grew along this fence. our attention was at first drawn to flickering light in these trees. we thought it might be hunters with flashlights out raccoon hunting and we were immediately concerned as our dogs had run on ahead. \r\n\r\nas we got closer we saw a round light float up just above this single row of trees and seem to bob along parallel to the fence for a ways before sinking slowly back down to almost ground level. probably around 30 feet rise / fall. we soon realized that what we thought was flashlights was actually a number of round orbs in amongst the trees. some either on or near the ground, some three or so feet up, and some higher in the trees. they all moved slowly, with slight bobbing motions. it was difficult to estimate how many there were, but our best guess was around twenty. all of the trees were bare, and the lights thru the branches created weird moving shadows on the snow.\r\n\r\nas we got closer we called for the dogs, as we didn't know what we were looking at. i had never heard of orbs, nor do i think anyone was reporting seeing them back then. honestly i can't remember what the reaction of the dogs was - whether they were barking at, ignoring, or exhibiting any other odd behaviour towards the orbs.\r\n\r\nwe got within 20 yards of the fence. the objects seemed totally oblivious to us. they kept on gently rising up, sinking down, bobbing along just above the tree tops or amongst the branches, and just sitting at various heights. the light they gave off was very bright - almost as bright as a full moon on a clear winter night. it was obvious that the orbs were intelligently controlled as they managed to avoid all contact with the tree branches and each other. i would estimate that they were within an area of a couple of hundred feet along the fence line. none ever came closer to us or seemed to stray too far back from this thin tree line. the field beyond was clearly visible thru the fence / trees.\r\n\r\ntwo orbs started to rise faster than usual from opposite ends of the fence line. as they passed tree height they suddenly accelerated to a tremendous rate of speed on what looked like a collision course. from our perspective it looked like they barely missed each other. where their paths crossed the light momentarily flashed much brighter than just double the light. they continued on their individual trajectories until they disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nthe remainder of the orbs continued to float about. it almost seemed like a ballet with two or three coming close together and then floating apart, others circling each other, etc... very elegant and controlled. beautiful to watch. nothing like balloons caught in the branches. slow, deliberate movement both horizontal and vertical. individual orbs would cover the whole 200 feet horizontally and then return to their starting point.\r\n\r\nwe eventually decided that they must be some type of ufos, but they were all around two to three feet in diameter ( as best as we could tell based on the fence height ), and not the flying discs that we had read about. how could there be anyone / anything small enough to pilot them?\r\n\r\nalthough my mother and i didn't find the orbs themselves scary, i had read one of the classic ufo books, which talked about flying saucers sucking up animals and taking off. i became concerned that our two dogs were going to be carried off. looking back, how these 3 foot balls were going to lift an irish setter and a yellow lab i don't know. silly.\r\n\r\nin total, we watched for around 10 minutes. occasionally another orb would rise up and quickly disappear. quickly as in so fast that they created a continuous blur of light. i don't remember any of these high fliers returning.\r\n\r\nas we made our way back to the farmhouse we could still see the orbs floating about ( the orbs were behind us ). the dogs must have followed without a fuss or i would remember that.\r\n\r\nonce back in the house it sort of sunk in. we weren't freaked out as much as intrigued. odd i know. we often talked about how oddly calm we were.\r\n\r\nwe were freezing cold, and not willing to put our skis back on and retrace our steps. since our farm is on the corner of two roads, we decided to get in our car and see if we could get back close to the location. unfortunately the sideroad had not been plowed more than a hundred feet or so past the intersection. we never saw the orbs again.\r\n\r\nwe told the immediate family about what we'd seen over the next few days. none were particularly interested. over the years i've told a few friends, but beyond that nothing. my mother died at 91 last spring. we compared notes about what we remembered sometime during her last year. our memories matched almost identically except for one odd point. she remembered the orbs as giving off red light and i remembered the orbs as giving off pure white light. \r\n\r\nit's probably possible to tie down exactly when this happened. later that same week the guelph newspaper had a picture of what was supposed to have been the clearest ufo picture to date. shot locally. as i remember the picture, it was of a classic saucer shaped craft - not matching at all what we had seen. the coincidence is what stuck with me.\r\n\r\nfeel free to write back if you would like any further information.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\ntoronto, ontario","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

west toward the afternoon sun at exactly 5:30 p.M. when i observed a shiny object reflecting the sunlight, rapidly approaching from wnw to ese or from 260° toward 80° at approximately 10,000 feet.\r\ni was wearing mirrored swim goggles to keep the sun out of my eyes and the sky was completely clear so i had an excellent view of the object. as it got closer to directly overhead, i realized that it was teardrop shaped with the point to the rear and very shiny like mercury.\r\nthe object appeared to jog slightly, to it's right and left in no particular pattern nor timing and was moving at a steady, high rate of speed. as it passed over, i also observed what appeared to be a commercial airline craft to the south, which was possibly at about 25,000 to 30,000 feet elevation.\r\nthe shiny object appeared to be about half the length of the jet and was traveling at about 4 times the speed. as the aircraft was heading more towards straight east, i do not believe that they were in pursuit of the object nor if they even observed it.\r\ni regret that i did not have my cell phone with me to try to get a photo but had i attempted to get it from my room the object would have been gone when i returned.\r\ni was in the u.S. air force as a flying crewchief for 12 years and am quite familiar with aircraft types and capabilities, so i know that the object i witnessed was not any type of aircraft i have ever seen, but i did see an identical object about 9 years ago, just outside the city limits of baxley, ga\r\non that occasion, i and several other drivers pulled over to the sides of the highway and observed the object pass slowly across the highway at about 5:00 p.M. at approximately 1000 feet, move south about 1 mile and hover over the high-tension power lines running from hatch nuclear power plant where i was working at the time.\r\nthe object seemed to have a shimmery space between it and the power lines for a few minutes and then i observed what appeared to be a military aircraft, much like an awacs or 135 flying down towards the object, at which time the object started to move away from the power lines toward the south and suddenly accelerated to an incredible speed and went out of sight. the military aircraft also turned south and headed out in pursuit.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
