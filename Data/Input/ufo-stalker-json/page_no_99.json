either it was tremendous in size,and moving above the atmosphere,or it was much lower,and somehow avoided creating a shock wave. my feeling is that it was about 2000 to 3000ft agl.If the object wasin the atmosphere,it had no audible means of propulsion.My wife stated that it looked more like a straight line with a light on each end.We were both in our late thirties at the time.I am a licensed pilot,and a major buff on military aviation,and aerospace technology.I live near the approach end of the williamsport regional airport,and am familiar with all the aircraft that frequent the airport.I feel that i am a very competent witness,and i can honestly say that if what we saw that night was classified military hardware,we are light years ahead of the de-classified  technology that exists in the skies today!If you wish to contact me for additional information,feel free to do so.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":88094,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.22382206603953,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11172017-0022","longitude":-76.91097857244388,"occurred":922838400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1510962679000,"summary":"Fast moving chevron shape with shimmering apperance.","tags":["disc","light","contact"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1511144454012,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":23,"maxtempi":73,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":10,"meantempi":50,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":-2,"mintempi":28,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":23,"maxtempi":73,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":10,"meantempi":50,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":-2,"mintempi":28,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"17754","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6806,"locationName":"Montoursville, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:10427"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Pelham","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" when i was playing basketball i started to notice there where 3 stars lined up perfectly and i started to take pictures and then a video and when i replayed it i saw a strange ufo i thought it was just a shooting star but when i zoomed in and replayed it i saw it was zigzagging and there was know way this was a plane,helicopter,  or a comet. after i saw the ufo's disappear i ended the video quickly and was a little shocked and scared. i lost sight of the object when the ufo randomly disappeared.

clear so went outside and took more. the lights were stationary and there was no sound.  i felt no different as i initially thought they maybe have been from the football stadium but the positioning for this was off as well as the stadium only has 4 light towers and the lights point downward.  we have seen the stadium lit up on hundreds of occasions and in many different weather conditions and it never had this effect on the clouds before.  we then thought it may be the christmas lights from the large christmas tree that sits in the bay but again the positioning was off.  i then thought it may have been some other event in the area that may have had lights on.  there were no beams of light pointing upward but i still asked friends in our area through our facebook page and no one seemed to know any venue that had lights on or an event that would use them.  i checked local news online but nothing came up.  i am not sure how long the lights were there for but can only say how long we saw
