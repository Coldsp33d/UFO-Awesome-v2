morning. we were talking and all of a sudden she tells me to make a wish because she saw a shooting star. she pointed at the direction she said she saw the shooting star and she asked me what shooting stars do. as i began to tell her what shooting stars were while looking at the area of the sky she saw it from she said very loudly \"there it is again\". we watched this thing which was a mix between a disc shape and a circle move at a high rate of speed from a north east to south west direction, then it shot straight up for about 500 feet or so, and then quickly changed direction heading back north east, this went vertical in a squiggly motion for a split second, stopped and hovered, then darted of east at a rapid speed and directional change. the thing made no noise at all and appeared to be probably about 5-8 miles away in the sky. could have been closer but it was hard to tell exactly. it really started and baffled my fiancee because she didn't really believe in ufo's until after this happened. what was truly amazing is how fast this thing moved and the maneuvers it made in changed direction so sharply at such a high rate of speed. i was in the military for five years and have seen my fare share of strange things in the sky before, but this one has to be one of the most vivid sightings i have had. the only reason we lost sight of the object was because the trees in our back yard got in the way as it moved back in that north easterly direction. it really affected my fiancee because she has never experienced anything like that before. it definitely was not an aircraft because there were no port and starboard lights, nor was there any sound at all. something moving that fast in the sky and maneuvering that quickly on a dime would have made a lot of engine noise had it been mad made. being that it happened so quickly and that our cell phones were on the charger for the night we were unable to get any photos of it. definitely going to keep a camera handy by the porch in case we see this thing again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

insects and frogs, and wondering i was being watched by \"alien entities\" in the rice fields. i noticed what i thought was a plane to my left, around the north westerly direction approx. 2 outstretched hands above the horizon. the initial thought was that it was a plane, as it was a light flashing across the sky. blink off for 1-3 seconds and blink back on for a flash approx. 2 outstretched handwidths away heading in an easterly, circular along the horizon, direction. this continued for around 12 to 15 blinks as i slowely turned nearly 180 degrees to track its path until it was lost to sight in the east. i considered it a plane initially to be a plane, but was moving way too fast to be conventional aircraft. then i considered the possibility of a high altitude meteorite skipping across the upper atmosphere, much like a stone skipping across the surface of a pond. this was also dismissed as the object disappeared and reappeared at different heights above the horizon. another possibility was was some type of experimental scram jet, which would account for the brief flash of light and the object appearing seconds later a long way form where it was, it also left a small trail when it flashed \"on\". all this happened within a matter of approx. 20-30 seconds.I lost sight of the object when i had to change positions to go around a tree. it was reasonably heavy

through the sky higher until it disappeared in the nw direction. from my back porch we were facing brawley school road. the globes were quite big in the sky seeming to be very close (there are always planes going over our house because there is the charlotte douglas airport south of us). these looked like they took off (literally) from exit 36 off of 77 or in that same direction. anyhow after seeing the one we noted another one coming up from the treetops (these all went diagonally and upwards in the same direction), then three more behind it all going at the same speed but together and very close only to disappear within 7 seconds of taking off in the sky. before the others disappeared there were 3 more behind those. both of us were in shock because this is the second time we've ever seen anything like this and it's so close to our home. we both ran inside to grab our phones to try to take video of any more orbs that might be going up but sadly both of our phones have completely useless cameras at night (i also tried my sons tablet and 3ds but neither would record anything with this street light on the road next to us facing our direction). my boyfriend gave up and came inside (while we were outside with our cameras we seen maybe four more) but i posted a message on facebook hoping someone else would go outside and record what we were seeing. i stayed outside for maybe ten minutes more seeing at least four more and then after that it stopped. during my observation there were at least 6 planes i noted flying overhead far far up in the sky. from my back porch they are so tiny, but these globes were huge in comparison (hence the aspirin size, i'd say planes are usually about pencil tip size). i'd also like to point out that during this our bulldog went nuts. he never barks at things he sees in the sky nor even seems to notice things like this but upon the first few that we seen he started barking and growling at them. he stayed with me outside and continued to growl every time he seen one. this surprised both of us the most because he's never growled at things in the sky.","distance":"Over One

gradually, but instantly, like someone flicked a switch. i ran inside and grabbed my phone and used the camera to try and capture images and video of it, samsung galaxy s . during my attempt to get it on film, my camera froze up a few times and i became nervous and started to feel like i was getting a headache, but that may be due to my having to look up while filming and keep my focus on the

recently looking back at the attached photos on a large screen tv and noticed a black dot in the photos.  when they started to play around with the image we were all shocked by what we found.  we also played around with the color, contrast, brightness of the pictures, i have attached those also.  what we found was amazing.  we would love to have them reviewed by professionals with professional software to see what turns up.  in one of the photos that was adjusted there looks to be some disturbance of the air around the craft, it almost looks like a key hole in the sky.  when compared to the rest of the sky you have to ask yourself what exactly is going on there.  \r\n\r\nthe first three images are the originals.  the one image named crazy ufo has been adjusted for best viewing.  if you zoom in to 800% you can observe the strange phenomenon happening in the sky.  \r\n\r\nmy brother and i are both professionals and my background is bio/chem/physics so we are not crazy folks looking
