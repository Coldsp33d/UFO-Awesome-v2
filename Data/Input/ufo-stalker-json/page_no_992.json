going so fast that it crossed the entire sky and passed in front of orion's belt before fading away- all in less than a minute. as soon as the first object faded from view, another appeared coming from the opposite direction. it appeared to be the same distance away, except before it crossed the sky, it had to ascend into the sky. it rose from below our line of sight and was all the way across the sky in seconds. \r\n\r\nthat object didn't fade away while in view, as the other object did, but instead kept moving straight across the sky until it was out of view completely. as soon as that object disappeared, we noticed a plane in the sky moving from east to west. the plane was blinking and we typically see planes every night following that same trajectory, so no surprise there. both objects that we saw were moving in a straight line, albeit one only did after ascending into the sky.  we first thought the objects were shooting stars, but both were visible for far too long and moved too far across the sky in such a short time. \r\n\r\ni was nervous while we were watching this happen. i'm not sure why, but it was just eerie.  we've had closer sightings before that shook us up, so maybe that explains the nerves. as soon as it was over my significant other told me is better get to mufon.

smoke a cigarette. i do not smoke in the house (wife). i was watching commercial aircraft going to midway in chicago. i am in an area that is part of the final approach path to mdw. these planes always fly at around 1500 ft and from a sw to ne flight path as they approach mdw. i turned around to call my dog to come to me so we could go back into the house and i saw a huge flame orange light fly above my neighbors house at about the same altitude as the commercial aircraft fly. the light was as large or slightly larger than any plane i have observed from this viewpoint. it was flying slightly faster than the commercial aircraft and was on a nw to se flight path which is on a collision course with the approaching aircraft. it seemed to fly in front of a commercial plane and then went on until it disappeared. now somewhat in disbelief as to what i had just seen, i noticed another ufo on the same flight path as the last one. i opened the back door and called my daughter down to see what was happening. i should note the time between these two sightings was about 3 to 4 minutes. both my daughter and i watched the second ufo fly along the exact same flight path almost intersecting another commercial aircraft. we thought there could be a mid air collision, but thankfully that didn't happen although it looked very close. my daughter was surprised as was i. then about 3 to 4 minutes later another ufo was observed along the exact same flight path. same color light, same triangular shape. my daughter and i saw a total of 5 of these crafts together all about 3 to 4 minutes apart. my wife then returned home and came outside to join us. she witnessed two ufo's with me and my daughter. there were a total of 6 ufo's that i witnessed. my daughter witnessed 5 of the 6 with me and my wife witnessed 2 of the 6 with both me and my daughter. these ufo's seemed to fly with complete impunity and did not seem to have any regard for the commercial aircraft in the area. i would also think one or more flight crews witnessed a ufo from the air. i would think at least one or more pilots thought there were going to be involved in a mid air collision. they had to see these objects. if they saw the objects, they should have inquired to the mdw control tower for confirmation of an air space intrusion. they were large and bright. i would also think there should be many more witness' to this event. it was a clear night, minimal clouds and no wind. these crafts were silent and flew on the exact same path. i kept looking in the sky for about another 45 minutes but saw nothing else unusual.I did not sleep well that night as my mind was too active and excited by these sightings. i have no idea what they were, but i do not think they were in contact or communication with the commercial aviation tower because they seemed to be crossing directly in front of the airplanes. although it was dark, these objects appeared to fly very close to the commercial aircraft. i have looked every night since the first sightings, but i think it may have been a one time event.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

anything move like this. once i observed it with binoculars. i was sure it was  a ufo. the binoculars are 7 x 35wide angle. by vivtar. the object hovered in the same location the whole time. it moved side to side in swaying arc and zigzaged and circle patterns. but in a series of rapid tight moves. it shot out at least six glowing white orbs that traveled down past the horizon. two of these there was a light that flashed from the ground after they went behind the tree line. and several of the orbs flew horizontal from the craft occasionaly fladhing single flashes at a time. and afterwards i was aexcited.While the craft was movibg in flight it was changing its attitude. you could see it horizontal verticle from the side. its lights flashed first 3 the all the colors i mentioned rose white orange yellow and blue. and the lights seemed to be flashing in a circular pattern. sometimes completing the circle and then others it would do certain sections in repitition varring back and forth. and the lights were in color clustered sections. with a larger light in center with 3spoke s of lights from center to ring of lights. pulsing the whole time. the last couple hrs. it was all white light and while they still had the outer ring of lights the inside changed patterns and size. pulsi g the whole time. it alsoseemed to be emitting a plasma or vapor trail that kind of whiped out from the object as it moved. i lost sight of it pre dawn. when some light cloud cover obscured it. it didnt make any sound i could hear. i did not feel threatened. i was excited. and amazed. however the cows on the farm across from us were making alot of moise. several times i shined a flashlight up at the orbs and a flash followed shortly. in response? i dont know. but it was within seconds of my flash it responded. and i was glad we had a family friend. staying the nite who observed it with me for about the first 90 minutes. afterwards i was thrilled to have wittnessed it. and will be

orange county california. i was loading my equipment in to the car and out of the corner of my eye what appeared to be two aircraft flying through each other's path to the west. when i looked i realized one was an airplane flying at altitude and the other was flying much lower eastbound at about the altitude of a patrol helicopter. it had a very bright solid red light and a dull pulsing green light offset above and to the right but very close together. i assumed it was a police helicopter (which generally have a dull solid green light and pulsing red light) until it suddenly came to a complete stop without decelerating at what appeared to be a distance of approximately two blocks away at roughly an altitude of 100ft. the object remained hovering for roughly 30 seconds and then lowered rapidly, again without any visible acceleration (it was instantly at full speed) until it was barely visible over the two story building across the street. again it remained there for a period of time (30sec - 2min) then raised up to its original altitude (note that each time this light moves in this description it does so with no apparent acceleration/deceleration) it hovers again for roughly 30 seconds and then moves north 200/300 feet. it then repeats the pattern of lowering then rising, hovering in between for close to a minute. it then moves west approx 50/100ft. then it moves south again aprox 200/300 ft. until it is due west from my position. it lowered again until i could just barely see it over the rooftop across the street (two story building) where it remained for a minute and lowered again out of sight. i never regained sight of object.\r\n\r\nmy initial thought was helicopter, due to the similarities of light arrangement, though the lights on a helicopter are further apart and local patrol helicopters also have white strobes, this did not. also, while feasible that a helicopter could possible move in such a way, i noticed that there was no wobble or rotation to the lights. they remained perfectly oriented as the object moved, where a helicopter will pitch and yaw. also, at the distance the object appeared to be, and as familiar with the area anf local air traffic as i am (the area is centered between airports within 10/20 miles east and west) i should have been able to hear it if it was a helicopter. i also suspected it could have been a radio controlled drone, but the lights were large (and the red exceptionally bright) and i am familiar with drones and how loud their four motors can be. at that distance again i should have been able to hear a drone, especially at that size. and again the lights were perfectly oriented. so i am at a loss to identify the object. i chose to report it in hopes that someone else might have witnessed it.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional
