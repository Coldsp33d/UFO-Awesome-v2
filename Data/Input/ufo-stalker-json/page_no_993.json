capture lightning strikes from a storm that was heading over my residence.  the storm came in from the west and was moving east/southeast and i had my camera on continuous shooting.  a lightning bolt was discharged from the wall cloud.  it is the only time a lightning bolt came from this cloud and within a few seconds after the bolt struct, i managed to capture 2 pictures of this object.  after taking approximately 145 photos of this storm, i saw 2 pictures with a cigar shaped object following the south end of the wall cloud.  i did not see this object at all while shooting them.  it was only visible after i reviewed my photos on my computer. \r\nthe object was a dull gray/black, solid body, no lights or windows.  there were no wings, tail or protruding areas coming from this object. the ends are rounded and fits the cigar shape perfectly.  it was approximately 30-50 ft in length (estimate) and about 700-900 ft high (again, estimate) and it followed in back of the main wall cloud that contained high winds and rain.  it moved to the east, along with the storm. it had moved hundreds of feet in less than 4 seconds.\r\nthere were no airplanes or helicopters in this area mainly because of the storm that was approaching. the only noise that was heard was the storm itself.  a few times my camera would not shoot to capture images.  so gaps were as long as 5 seconds on some of the pictures.  while most images of the storm and object were captured, fluently, i had to refocus a few times in order to get the camera to shoot some of the images (although no object was visible in those pictures).\r\n\r\ni have included pictures of this object.  also sending the stretch between the first sighting of the object and a couple of in between pictures to show you a time sequence from the first picture of the craft to the last picture of it.  also included, are pictures of the readings on my camera at the time they were taken.\r\n\r\n**** note ****\r\non my camera report, it reads the time of these pictures were in the morning.  it is suppose to read 6:25 pm...Not  am.  my camera time (am/pm) is not correct.  this storm and the object captured was in the evening, not in the morning. \r\n\r\ntime sequence:  in between the pictures with the object clearly visible, there are 4 pictures without the object.  two pictures with the craft visible share the same time in seconds with two pictures that do not have object visible  (6:25:47 and 6:25:51). example:  picture 0468 (object visible) and 0469 (object not visible) share the same time as 6:25:47.  also, picture 0472 (no object visible) and picture 0473 (visible object) have the same time 6:25:51.  my camera does record 100th of a second time frames.  pictures 0468 and 0469 are 30/100ths of a second apart and pictures 0472 and 0473 are 60/100ths of a second apart.  \r\n\r\ni am sending in the enhanced (contrast/brightness/cropped) pictures along with the original pictures.  the enhanced easily make the object more visible.  \r\nadding to this report is another picture from a previous rotating wall/funnel cloud and object i captured last year (june 17, 2013), incase you want to compare the objects from this storm and the recent storm in this report.  it has an object similar to the object shaped in this recent report.  it is enhance in a sepia color picture to make this previous object more visible.  i will also send in the original photo of the 2013 object/storm.  \r\n\r\ni can't send you all the pictures that i would like to on this report, but upon request, i will send you more time sequenced pictures or any others that i took during this event.  please let me know if you need more of them.  thank you.\r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

directly back to original location.  i watched this three times before pointing the light out to my friend.  while he was watching, we observed this 2 more times.  then all of the sudden it went on a direct descent below my sight line due to neighbors roof tops.\r\n\r\nduring this observation, we were seated and not moving.  i'm a military officer and know that this was not the movement of a

bus with a driver. we were going to collect the children from daycare and had just left ipswich suffolk uk and were stopped at a traffic light controlled roundabout at copdock on the a12, i was in the front passenger seat when i noticed an unusual object wnw of us not far of - possibly over the village of rushbrook ? i said to the driver \"look at that ! what is it ?\" the driver said \"i'm watching traffic lin, i cannot look\" i said \"just there, a quick look ray \" he glanced at the object and said \"it's that blimp from the pub; probably broken away\". just behind our position by a mile or two there is a country pub that does have an ad' blimp above it but that was not what i saw and said so, it was a different shape, the pub blimp is squat, stubby, whereas this object was more zeppelin shaped but with no features like the cockpit underneath. there were no features at all, no lights, no fins, no wings, no marking that i could see. as we moved off around the roundabout and along the a12 i watched the object out of sight and said to ray the driver that that thing is not the pub blimp ! he said we would come back to town past the pub and look later. so, about an hour and a half later we drove by the pub and saw the blimp still tethered there whereas the other object had gone. if it had have been the pub blimp that had broken away from it's tether then surely it would have taken longer than an hour and a half to retrieve it!\r\ni asked around and looked in the local newspapers for several days after but nothing was reported. it struck me as very odd because of the shape, no cockpit, or any nav' lights flashing. it was either stationary or moving very slowly as it did not appear to move for the 4 minutes i watched it. later, ray agreed that it was not the pub blimp and it was oddly shaped. it was a uniform dark grey, almost black and had no windows.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was born on 1961, i was young when this event arrived,i think it was before i began to go to school (don't really know the year). it was a hot day, i was in my brother's room, kneeling on the floor, playing  with his littles cars. suddenly, in the corner of my sight on the right (west), i saw very quickly two silhouettes moving rapidly from the window nearby the end of that wall. i jumped on my feet and turn around to see what that was because i felt that was very strange: it was too fast and too silent to be real persons, and what i saw, was not exactly human. then i saw that there's nobody with me in the room (the door was closed). but i know that i really saw something. so, i began to search everywhere in the room: under the two beds, in the closet: nothing. there was a big (for me at this age)chest of drawer placed in front of the window. i was not afraid, just really curious to find out. i was trying to move the chest of drawer to see if they passed by the window when my older brother irrupt in the room, asking me what i was doing. so, i tell him what i saw. he started the research to the window. he showed me that the mosquitoes' net was still attached, so i have to admit that the two silhouette was too fast to open and close that net. after our search in all the room, my brother told me that was just my imagination. but, at that time, i knew what i saw. so after he left the room and close the door again, i began to stay still, watching the right corner of the room. then, slowly, i start to slowly move my self to the right, my eyes wild open. then, i saw them again, still from the corner of my eyes; they were at the same place. then, as they began to move to the right very rapidly, they disappear again from my sight. \r\ni still began to turn to my right very slowly and then, i saw them again! i was so surprised that i looked at them directly and they disappear! quickly, i turn my eyes to the left to find them and then realize that i can only see them from the corner of my eyes. i tried a couple of times to look at them directly, but i had to look elsewhere if i want to see them. i didn't move anymore, not feeling afraid but too curious and trying to see them better because, they were really not human being. hard to look at them that way, but i really paid attention to them. i noticed that they were looking at me. then, i heard them by telepathy and in my own langage (french) that they seems to be surprise by the fact i could see them. when i heard that, i jumped a little bit, and then again, they noticed that i can ''heard'' them. strangely, they looked surprised again. then, as they started to move fast again, they quickly disappear from my sight. \r\ni search and search again for them in the room, but never found them. so i return to play with the little cars when suddenly i saw two strange legs and feet by my left side! this time, seems that they autorize me to look at them directly because when i look at him, i just had the time to see a tiny finger pointing to my forehead and heard that strange thing told me: everything will be alright, we will not hurt you (ça va aller, nous ne te ferons aucun mal). as the tiny finger touch very delicatly my forehead, i felt my head falling back and then i was unconscient. at that moment, i was not affraid, but still very curious. \r\nwhen i began to awake, the first thing i felt like something, like a medical tube, was slightly going out of my nostril (don't remember right or left). then, i began to open my eyes and i had just the time to saw a little bit that tube. i closed my eyes a little bit ant when i opened them, i was still alone in the room. i stand up and try to look everywhere again, but i found nothing. then i thought that was a dream and return to my little car, but my head full of questions. suddenly, i thought that i felt a fly under my nose and try to chase it with my hand, but when i took my little car, i saw blood on my hand. i was young, so i did what every little kid do when they saw blood, i began to cry and shout at my family trying to tell them what just did happen. my sister cought me on my way out and asked me what happened, but inside me, i knew that if i told them the truth, they won't believe me. so the only thing that went out of my mouth was: i'm bleeding! i'm bleeding! i was looking to my sister and in direction of the room several times. \r\nmany dreams of aliens and spaceship after that. it was also in the time of the tv series ''lost in space''. but i think they put a tag in my head, like we did with the animals. don't know the purpose, but since i'm young, i have health's problems. i also had a head trauma at approximatly that age, so i think that my health's problems may be related to that trauma. \r\nnever saw them again! end of my story... oups! almost forgot, the description of that two visitors: they were about 4 foot 3 inches high (i still have the chest drawer at my home and from what i remember, they were just a little bit higher than that chest). they were like nude, very thin, maybe gray skin because it was not too dark and really not a clear skin ether), dark eyes, direct nostrils in the face and a small mouth. too far away in time, not sure and can't remember more than that.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown,N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":59078,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.6637535,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-08192014-0016","longitude":-74.0019645,"occurred":-110653200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Quebec","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

and my attention was drawn to two very bright red lights traveling slowly but steadily from the south in a nnw direction. \r\ni watched them for 10 seconds or so before running inside to get my wife and two daughters to have a look to validate what i was looking at. \r\nthe orb like structures seemed to radiate or glow a bright red colour and they made no sound whatsoever as they moved across the sky.\r\nmy initial thought was they were satellites as they had the same constant speed observed of satellites on clear nights. i then realised that the sky was very cloudy and that these lights were below the cloud cover. this was proven when the western most light began to gradually be obscured by clouds before disappearing entirely. the other light followed it behind clouds shortly after. both lights could be seen gradually disappearing behind the clouds over a period of a couple of seconds and showed that they were emitting their own light. \r\ndespite scanning the clouds in the area i was unable to see the lights reappear. there was probably 80% cloud cover on the night.\r\nthere is an airstrip in ballarat the services small planes and i am very familiar with the sight and sound of these planes. we also have a hospital that occasionally flies helicopters to melbourne so am also familiar with lights and sounds associated with these. these lights were neither.\r\nthe distance between them, though impossible to accurately guess, would have meant that it would have to be a very large plane between the two orbs and it would've had to be flying very low and silently.  \r\nas i watched the lights gradually disappear behind the cloud cover there was no structure observed anywhere associated with the orbs. they appeared to be completely independent of each other however flying in absolute unison.\r\ni'm a scientist and can offer no logical explanation for this sighting.\r\n

watching all the firework shows across the sacramento valley.At 9:15 i noticed a bright white light across the valley over woodland. it looked like a plane, jet coming towards me.Then a few minutes latter it moved closer to me and higher.Strange thing i never saw it actually move. it had moved about 10 miles closer and 100 feet higher. it looked like it was right above citrus heights.It still looked like a jet heading my way. very white and bright but it never moved.So then i pulled out my binoculars and looked at it. it seamed longer and sideways to the ground. so i pulled out my powerful spotting scope and focused on it. it appeared to be angling sideways and about 30 feet long. as i focused more i could see 7 white lights in a row along the side of it. it just sat there hovering.I new right then i was seeing a ufo. so i picked-up my phone and called my brother in curtis heights. i ask him to look-up in the sky. right then it just disappeared. he never got to see it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned
