quickly realized that i wasn't looking at stars at all. the three red lights were much brighter and much larger than any stars in the sky. then, i thought that maybe they were flares of some sort, but they were steady and unwavering as i would expect from a flare and i couldn't see any smoke or chute attached. at this point they started moving across the sky. as they moved they also changed formation a bit. they started as close to a line formation but as they moved the middle one moved below (relative to my perspective) the west most light. they were shaped as more of a triangle at this

crossed arrow hill road/intersection when i looked across the street to the east and noticed an extremely pure brilliant white light in the sky.  my first thought was that the lights were extremely bright for a passenger plane.  i immediately realized that the object was not a plane because of its size and speed and the shape of the object.  this object was flying slightly east of highway 281 north in the direction of randolph air force base.  i realized that the object was not a plane because it had no sound and the brilliant white lights remained as this object continued southward and out of site.  because the speed of the object was so fast i decided to count until it was out of my sight.  all and all i witnessed the object for about 15 seconds however from the time it was directly in line with me to the time it was out of my sight was roughly eight seconds.\r\n\r\ni have drawn a picture and attached it below of the object i witnessed in the sky.  logically i know i should not be so confident about the shape and size of the object because the object was against the night sky and the display of brilliantly bright white lights which went around the object should have concealed the object.  regardless i was able to clearly make out the shape of the object.\r\n\r\njust as the object left my sight a passenger plane approached the standard downwind leg on its approach to the san antonio airport.  there is no doubt in my mind that the pilots would have seen this object in the night sky due to how bright the object was, and the speed in which it was traveling. another reason i believe they would have seen this object is because it flew directly through the passenger plane downwind flight path from the north to the south and the passenger plane was only 10 seconds away from the point of where i first had seen the object to when the passenger plane flew through the objects path at roughly the same altitude of the object.\r\n\r\nthe object i witnessed did not flash or change colors in any way.  for the most part the exterior lights remained constant however on two occasions it appeared as if the lights strobed around the object twice in the time i witnessed it in the sky.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

bertrand road in niles, mi. i had just gone through the intersection where bertrand intersects portage road. on this section of bertrand, there are large soybean fields on either side of the road. the fields are level and there are no trees at all for the length of the fields. the soybean fields start approximately two-tenths of a mile after the portage road intersection and extend for approximately eight-tenths of a mile. the soybean fields end at mayflower road (south off of bertrand, just before the bridge that carries bertrand over the u.S. 31 bypass).\r\n\r\nwhen i was approximately one-half mile from mayflower road, i saw a pulsing blue light that appeared to be situated at road level on mayflower. my first thought was that the light was a police car that had pulled someone over on mayflower. the light was a very deep blue, but was very bright. it was flashing on and off about once per second. the trees on the west side of mayflower were being illuminated by the flashing light. a couple of seconds after first seeing the light, the light suddenly started to move within a small area. it moved upwards slightly (still lower than the height of the trees next to mayflower) and then it moved to the left a bit. it suddenly took off at a high rate of speed, traveling east along bertrand (towards me). the light was traveling over the soybean field on the south side of bertrand. the light was approximately thirty to forty feet above the field and was roughly the same distance from the edge of bertrand road. as it passed my car, i was amazed at how fast it was moving. it zipped east along the south side of bertrand and came to rest near a stand of trees at the east end of the soybean field on the north side of bertrand. the light traveled the entire distance of the soybean fields (eight-tenths of a mile) in approximately three seconds. (i’ve calculated the speed of the moving light and, even using a conservative estimate of five seconds, the speed of the blue light was over 580 miles per hour).\r\n\r\nall the windows on my car were closed and i was listening to a talk program on the radio. i heard no sound whatsoever from the light as it passed me.\r\n\r\nas i said, it was very dark outside, but the light did not appear to be mounted on any type of vehicle. it was simply a globe of blue light. although i didn’t have much information to judge the size of the light, it gave the impression of being roughly the size of a basketball.\r\n\r\nmy biggest regret is that i then chose to continue on to work (so i wouldn’t be late for a 7 o’clock meeting) instead of turning around to investigate the light which was still pulsing and illuminating the trees at the east end of the field. i assumed that it would be gone by the time i got to it and i didn’t want to be late. wrong choice - next time, i’ll choose to be late!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":59060,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.8335694,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08182014-0042","longitude":-86.25003679999999,"occurred":1408367400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1408424989000,"summary":"Blue orb moving at high rate of speed at thirty feet above ground","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Niles, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:116724"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Reykjavik","country":"Iceland","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My associate and i were at work (security guards) having a cigarette, when we both looked for no apparent reason up in the sky to the same place, at first i thought we were looking at orion's belt, but then one of the objects started moving \"up\" towards the brightest dot, a second or two later the others apart from the brightest one started moving as well in the same direction. the first object split in two that moved parallel then the \"new\" object took a left turn, and the \"lower\" two that originally travelled after the original object fallowed after it. all four objects then appear to rise up from sight until we manage to block a little of the ambient light an get a better look at the sky. all the items are moving erraticly, until they disappear all to gather.

to hover over something in a south east direction. after a few minutes it cut back towards the north about half way from where it originated. it hovered there for a few minutes then began to go into the cloud cover as there is a storm blowing through. it took about 5-10 minutes for it to completely disappear. the whole time it didn't shrink. it flew in straight and diagonal lines and seemed

to look at the stars in an empty parking lot. the sky was perfectly clear without a cloud in sight. we were just looking around trying to pick out constellations when i saw something that looked like a star, but wasn't a star at around 11:00 pm. from where i was looking, it was positioned fairly close to the top of the mountain (it was in the north part of the sky). it wasn't moving like most ufo sightings, but it wasn't completely still like all the other stars. it looked like it was hovering and it kind of flashed a reddish/greenish color. we had forgotten to bring our telescope that night so it was hard to figure out what it was. we gave up on it and went back to our campsite. the next night, on august 17th, 2014, we went to the same spot again and brought the telescope. the sky was just as clear as the night before. i tried to find the object again so i could use the telescope on it, but it wasn't there anymore. i didn't try to look for it, but about half an hour after we had been there, my dad spotted the object again at about 10:00 pm, but it had moved to the west part of the sky. he finally got the telescope on it and what i saw completely blew me away. the object appeared to be several red and green lights, (about 7-10 of them) in the shape of a circle and it was completely black in the middle. they kind of looked like christmas lights, but they were way too high up in the sky to be anything like that. what was really strange about it was the way it moved. the object stayed in place, but the lights on it moved back in forth, almost like an amoeba. the object continued to get even more mysterious when we saw another one of the exact same description in the exact opposite direction of the sky (east). they were at the same height and everything. i was unable to get a picture of it since it was so far away that you could only see the detail of it through the telescope. it looked like a slightly colored star to the naked eye.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":59056,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.051389,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08182014-0038","longitude":-122.299444,"occurred":1408339800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1408421445000,"summary":"Two

no traffic, no neighbors close by (city vs country)and how great the stars looked. so we were talking and watching the sky to see if one of us (4 of us at this time) could see a shooting star. one of us noticed an orange/red orb in the southeast sky. we all watched, thought it might be a meteor, but it didn't seem to be moving. then after several seconds we realized it was moving. it was heading north and as came within a more easterly view we could see that there were 2 orange/red lights. the front light was bigger and seemed more luminous than the smaller light in the back (both were very bright). the lights were connected by a dull dark shape (unknown)in the middle. we called 3 other people out of the house to see this, now there are 7 of us watching these lights flying slowly and

particular event. last february, i was driving throught nevada  headed for nationals in phoenix az, 20 miles below tonapah nv, i was driving 75 mph, pick up truck, 4 horse living quarters big traier. a craft appeared on the left hand side of the pickup, less the 300ft  away, pacing us at 75mph. all three of us saw the event. the craft had three huge yellow red circles that began pulsating in an irratic manner, the craft then rotated light side down which revealed a triangle shape, where it then shot straight up and disappeared.  we was over 20 craft that evening.   how did it make us feel, me excited, my companions were a bit freaked out. the craft made no noise. i know we are not alone here, just want to know if you know what these photos represent. these photos were taken through a dirty front windshield, but those are not bugs. thank you for your time.  i have more photos taken consecutively , but there is not enough

driving, got a call from his brother.  his brother and another nephew had spotted the object from the mother's house.  the object disappeared behind some trees so the witnesses in the jeep went to an open area where they thought it might have landed.  when they got there the object had disappeared.  the driver/main witness, estimated the speed of the object at 100 mph. the driver's brother confirmed the speed and elevation.  the observation took place about three miles from rockwell international.  the only air traffic was about five miles away.  the observation lasted for about one
