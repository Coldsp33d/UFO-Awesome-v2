cigarette and watching the night sky as i often do. it was a clear night with no cloud, the local light pollution level was quite low and there was no moon visible at the time.\r\n\r\ni looked to my right (east) and noticed a diamond shaped object moving across the sky at high speed with the short axis being the direction of travel. the object was giving off a fairly dim red-orange glow and had a steady, dull, white light at each point. the object moved in a straight line, almost overhead, east to west then started to veer north as it was about to pass out of sight.\r\n\r\nalthough i could not be sure, i had the impression that the object was at a fairly high altitude. there was no sound and it covered the visible area of sky in 10 to 15 seconds. in comparison, an airliner crossing the same area of sky is visible for at least 2 minutes. the widest point of the object, from my viewing position, was about 2 inches which means that if it was at high altitude it was very large.\r\n\r\nbeing a former member of the raf i am familiar with many types of high speed aircraft. if it had been a fast military aircraft (there are no fast jets based within 100 miles) then even at 10-15000 ft, an altitude that would make it appear slightly smaller than the observed object, i would have clearly heard the engines but,as previously stated, there was absolutely no sound from this craft.\r\n\r\ni felt privileged to have observed this event but am fully aware that many of these sightings end up having a very mundane explanation.

very far. so i'm working this am and i see a bright star in the sky just appear all of a sudden. seems strange. i thought it could be plane but i've seen them before and they fly much higher up and are much brighter. this one seems to hover and was going in an upward motion not going toward or away from boston which is what the planes do. i went to get my glasses because i was seeing little sparks coming out of it from the ground. this didn't make sense. i thought it was just my eyes but once i got my distance glasses on i could see this was no airplane, helicopter or anything i have ever seen before.\r\ni immediately trapped my iphone and started recording. i have the video i took i can send you. i then look closer and see that its bobbing a little. it also has this like x pattern where there is one ring of white light it seems going one way and another ring going the other way. they are bright silver and are from what i can tell creating the bobbing. i then steady my camera on the window seal and go to trap my big camera with my 70-200 lens (i'm a wedding photographer so i have that gear) stumbling to get my camera i miss where it went. i hear a noise, then there is nothing. i look around frantically looking to see where the thing went and can't see it anywhere. its as if it just cloaked and disappeared. i look at my iphone and it went out of frame. i have seen all kinds of aircraft and i have never seen anything that looked like this. you can even tell in the video that there is that x pattern and i don't know what kind of object would do this. i know that we are near a high activity place called the bridgewater triangle. if you were to look down the airfield you would be looking directly at bridgewater, ma. i've seen 4th of july fireworks from my apt and all sorts of flares and this was defiantly hovering, moving and just appeared like a huge glowing star in the sky. with my iphone its hard to tell the size and scale but it was at least as big as a car hovering over the fields out there. i'm actually too scared to go look what is in the woods where it was hovering but if i see someone staggering out of there i will know what happened. cops patrol the area a lot here and this was something weird which i had never seen.  i know that this once was a military base that did have nukes once hidden in certain places but they should all be long gone. anyway, i have video of it. i tried to steady the video on the window seal so that it was not shaky and can hand over any video you would like. its not much but its something. this was very cool. i did feel a calm presence with the craft and on a spiritual level i didn't feel threatened. i couldn't communicate with it, nor would i want to. although i am a little spooked telling you about it now. i have never seen anything like this before. it just hovered and looks very scientific. very pretty and glowing like a star, really beautiful and dangerous at the same time.

object\" travel across the moon in a horizontal direction from the bottom right side of the moon to the top left side of the moon. it took the object about 15-25 seconds to cross the moon. it was \"massive\" the end of the upside down v was very long, compared to the size of the moon in my binoculars it looked like an estimated 1/10 the size of the moon roughly. it appeared to be extremely close to the moons surface as well. never seen anything like it in my life and never saw it again just that one time. the shape was solid, there was no wings, flaps, etc. and i saw it very well with my binoculars. an object that looked like the letter v but upside down and very large, near the end points of the bottom of the object looked sharp and very elongated. i remember shortly after this sighting i made a post on abovetopsecret and only one other person says he saw the exact same thing as me but nobody else and i have not found anything else about it online. can provide more information if you contact me. i drew an exact duplicate picture and report with exact date and time on paper but would have to find it. will get it if you request

girl at this highway construction site while driving part of my crew from westlock alberta to the international airport at edmonton, alberta. i was flag stopped at a point within 20 feet of the flag girl to the left of of the highway....Traffic was routed off the highway down into a hollow ditch as the the tunnel intersected at/under the highway and a temporary road ran off the highway into the tunnel. the immediate work area was surrounded on three sides by high mounds of clay. i was able to eyeball the inner work area through a crack in the fence beside the flag girl. the flag girl held a long stationary smile that never wavered, her eyes were black orbs. the flag girl stared at me constant while waving us ahead...The one thing that i remember i had 4 employees in the truck, all hindus; they all sat there in their seats with eyes staring straight ahead, never blinked, never moved their heads, just sat there; i was talking to them while i was looking around inside the work area (it never dawned on me that they were in a trance of some sort)nobody said anything back. i did see a person walk from a point behind the flag girl down into the tunnel with some sort of a clip under their arm; i did see a tractor trailer (gravel box type)travel from a point 1/2  mile away all the way into the work area and go down into the tunnel. i left the work area and continued on towards the airport and to add to that experience, i had moved my crew from that location (westlock) to topley bc a week later. when i checked into my cabin and got settled in...I turned my laptop on

in the few seconds i had to stare at this site i could see what appeared to be human forms swinging picks and shovels. i never thought anything of it. on another occasion i was driving this same hiway again going north and i saw this same tunnel, but with cars parked in it (cars were parked both sides backs to the wall and there was room enough for a vehicle to drive down the center; there were dim lights on the walls. again never thought anything of it. after that i never saw the tunnel again until the above mentioned experience under the highway. the only other strange thing i saw on one of my trips was an old farm house (in the area where i saw the tunnel) that used to have pens for whatever (cattle etc.  i did remember seeing animals there)this old farm yard and pens were converted to some sort of dirt beds, but the color of the dirt beds did not jive with earthy tones they were strange colors...","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

now. this night, aug 17, 2014. i was  on a walk with the 11 year old daughter of my girlfriend (i'm 50) and we were getting some air for her aging pet rat, whom we walk nightly in a little sling.. we always look up as we have noticed objects before together and sure enough within 2 minutes, we noticed another super bright \"power-up\" ufo that we have witnessed many times the last few summers from time to time when camping near mt hood and mt adams. \r\n\r\nbut this was in a well lit parking lot at the mountain park rec center in lake oswego, and there were tons of people at some kind of wedding party inside. it was twilight and stars were just starting to appear. this first object we spotted at 80 degrees overhead  looking to the east and it got extremely arc light white as it \"powered up\" (for lack of better words)  brighter and brighter then slowly winked out as it moved toward  the south. definitely moved faster than satellites we observe all the time and some of the planes we also observed in the sky. this object was very high up, id have to guess outside our atmosphere. we observed this \"power up\" at 9:10pm ( checked my phone)  and couldn't believe we had seen one so fast as we actually were talking about hoping we would see one before we went on the walk. \r\n\r\nwe then walked around the rec center on walking paths and were celebrating out sighting ... while also splinting out multiple airplanes in the sky with their landing lights and red and green nav lights. explaining to each other how its very easy to tell the difference between a plane and these power ups. \r\n\r\nwe then  came back around to the parking lot... saw some people mingling and then i noticed a much lower bright golden orb with white star like spikes like a xmas tree topper moving very slowly and deliberately to the east and silently overhead. i shouted to the 11 year old to look and i pulled out my iphone 5s and began filming before it disappeared behind a tall pine tree.... i was even able to get  an aircraft in sky that made noise in the same video, this golden object however made  no noise as shown on video. i am also familiar with what floating lanterns look like and this did not ascend or descend but moved deliberately and was much brighter and golden white. \r\n\r\nnote: i have seen this object before last july 2013 at the eceti ranch in trout lake, wa. that too moved west to east at about 60 degrees and was the exact same craft. well it looked the same i can't say it was the same one. \r\n\r\ni always feel an overwhelming sense of comfort and joy when i see these, never anxiety or excitement its more wonderment and calm... i should also say this was the 11 year old first time seeing the golden orb. i loved that she was there and said \"well we both saw it so nobody can say its not true\" lol ... \r\n\r\nthe best part is she also observed (at the same time we saw the orb and she says it on the video)  that she saw another faint light object moving to the west and much much higher than anything in the sky, but it was clearly (to me) a single white light satellite (which i mention in video) but i thought it was incredible to have the silent object on video... with both an aircraft making noise and a satellite at the same time to clearly differentiate this object we were observing was something very different. \r\n\r\nthe golden orb and bright whote light definitely felt benevolent, and intelligent if that makes sense. like we asked for it and they revealed themselves if that makes sense. i'm one to always look for a scientific explanation, peer reviewed studies. but im telling you there is an intelligence here that feels like it knew we were watching and was showing off. \r\n\r\nwhether the golden orb was related to the bright power up is hard to say, but our guts tell us it is.  they were very different in terms of speed and the bright white one did not scintillate like a star as the slower moving glowing orb did. i would say the second sighting was between 9:17pm and 9:25pm pst.\r\n\r\ni tried to be still in the video so any sudden movements were me, not the object. it floated quietly and effortlessly and almost had a little wobble... the 7 points of light coming out don't really show up on video so maybes its the atmosphere or something but the stars don't look that spiky... like it looks when one squints at xmas light or something. \r\n\r\nthat was the most interesting feature. like one of those spoked xmas tree toppers shape wise yet it was clearly a round golden glowing solid object. for what its worth,  it was not all energy like orbs i've seen on you tube... , this seemed like a glowing metallic (maybe) but definitely glowing solid orb. \r\n\r\nas you can see in the video it went behind a tree and when we walked around to try to find it again it was gone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Well, \r\n\r\nmy wife, daughter and i were on our way home from getting ice cream at our neighborhood foster freeze.  when we appeared a block away from our house on our street, we all noticed a medium sized object--perhaps the size of a school bus or larger from 200-300 meter away, floating in the north west sky of torrance.  at first glance we thought it was an object being towed by a small single engine plane; one similar to that of a plane towing a sign behind it along the coast of a beach.  however, this object was not being towed, as this plane of reference previously mentioned flew east leaving behind the glowing object.  the best way to describe the physical attributes of the object would be to say it was most certainly a circle shape.  it seamed so close that i kept doubting my judgement of what it could possibly be; something that looked like it was on fire, but defied all logic there of.  how could something just be floating along at a leisurely pace, be illuminated by such a orange-yellow glow, and make no sound at all?  i mean this didn't just glow--the center of the circle was more of a solid color--the outer which i would estimate to be 30-40% of total light emitted was such a faded fuzzy burning glow, that i couldn't even match it with something in my brain for reference.  looking back, perhaps staring at a candle in a dark room for a minute would produce the same effect.\r\n\r\nafter five seconds of initially speculating aloud with my family of what it could be, i pulled out my i phone 4s, and managed to get about 1:10 video of the object.  its path was linear for the most part, unaltered, only slightly deviating from it's observable course when passing behind a large tree.  upon the continued path following the tree, it continued on its destination east bound for approximately fifteen seconds before it began to flicker.  the best way i can describe it is if the direct current of a battery were lifted and reapplied to complete the circuit of a flashlight at intervals of approximately .5 seconds, for approximately three seconds.  following this flicker, all lights were out, and only a small black figure of where the object was could be seen disappearing into the night.  \r\n\r\nthe story is not over, as approximately thirty seconds after this happened, my family and i all noticed another bright light coming from the south east.  this light was different however.  the object did not seem like it was on fire, floating like a balloon, bouncing along its path.  it most certainly was a fighter jet.  its most distinct characteristics was its triangle shaped frame with small indents along the inside rear wings which gives our fighter jets such a noticeable style.  this fighter jets light was white.  bright white.  something totally opposite of what we just saw.  this appears as if it were out of a movie, and still has me guessing what we just witnessed.  the fighter jet flying at such a low altitude, coming from the direction of where this object just vanished from, and just thirty seconds after witnessing the fireball object is all just too coincidental.  \r\n\r\nto coincide with my more scientific thought patterns, i immediately ruled this as a balloon of some sort, but then i began to think of a drone.  however, neither of these were logical due to the fact of this object glowing and appearing to be on fire.  lets think.  what could produce light, but not shine it or direct it?  why when is it that when my family and i were staring at it, not one of us could make out its exact shape.  the glow of yellow/orange had us mesmerized.  a drone is most certainly out of the picture.  of course their range is remarkable, however this object let me remind you was huge.  there is no way a drone could fly/hover the way this did and emit such a captivating aura of light.  \r\n\r\nwe have this all on video, from our original sight of it in the north west sky, to it flying all the way and eventually disappearing into the east sky.  coupled with the fighter jet not even one minute after our sighting, we are in no way to be convinced otherwise that what we saw tonight was not a ufo.  \r\n\r\na side note:  the attached video, in no way gives absolute justice to what occurred.  the focal range of the i phone is so low to begin with the object appears to be far away (reference to a 2.8-12mm cctv lens to that of a motion picture camera).  let me assure you, this object was large and in charge.  as previously mentioned i would describe it as the size of a school bus in diameter from a distance of about 200-300 meters.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
