[link moved to fi section/cms/tg]\r\n if you ever wanted to truly see how aliens are monitoring or studying us, and witness their technology, this video is it.\r\nthe video is a black and white infrared recording using a l3 mx15 eoir camera. the ir video uses back hot, meaning the blacker something is the hotter, or fuller of energy it is. the video was leaked onto youtube because the federal agents who recorded it realized the federal government was not interested in disclosing it. the video was recorded from the screen of a laptop using a iphone type device. spanish is heard as background noise to distort the leakerâ€™s voices so they are not discovered. disregard all audio. lastly, the poster of the video speculates it was recorded from a cbp blackhawk. in reality it was recorded by a cbp dhc8 turboprop maritime patrol aircraft. this is not a maybe, this is 100% alien technology on earth, in our skies, and under our oceans. the video was taken in aguadilla puerto rico, and can be verified by calling cbp caribbean air and marine branch, and aguadilla airport control tower (the ufo was over the airport without permission and tower controllers saw it and tracked it on radar.\r\non april 25, 2013 at 2122 local/april 26, 2013 0122z a customs and border protection caribbean air and marine branch dhc8 maritime patrol aircraft was on a routine patrol when it encountered a ufo immediately after takeoff. the object was spotted visually by the captain of the aircraft, and the aguadilla control tower operator. it appeared to have a strange red light.  the customs and border protection crew thought the aircraft might be a smuggler so they began to follow the ufo, and record a ir video. the ufo circled the aguadilla airport and made its way to the ocean. initially the ufo appears as a forward flying horseshoe, then as it makes its way to the ocean, it changes its configuration to a more spherical shape. the ufo skims on top of the ocean, and submerges, unaffected by the hydrodynamic forces. watch the video carefully at 01:24:39 (time in upper left corner) when the object gets really dark (hot) another ufo actually pops out of the ocean and joins the original ufo in formation. then both ufoâ€™s make controlled entries into the ocean.  alien technology is no doubt under the ocean near puerto rico!\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

sleeping in their tents.\r\n\r\nsince the site was at an altitude of 1200 meters and the temperature was very low at night, there were no insects flying, and the fireflies (lightning bugs) do not exist in the area (the fireflies do not fly at such a high speed in the first place and my camera cannot catch such dim lights). the site was completely dark and there were no outdoor lights nearby (and it was a dark moonless night). i could see many stars in the sky with the naked eyes, but my small digital camera (casio ex-h10) could not catch any starlight. so you can guess how bright that object actually was.\r\n\r\nthese video clips are for the general citizens, so i did not go into details in my explanation especially regarding somewhat mysterious incident occurred before the ufo appeared.\r\n  \r\nabout one and half hours before i saw ufo, i was surprised by a small mechanical sound that i heard from my left side (no more than two feet from where i was standing in the camping site), and i saw a long-haired young woman in white clothes. as i mentioned,the site was almost completely dark and i could not even see my shoes very well, so i could narrowly recognized that woman but could not see her face. then i saw a small and round red light in front of her chest or her solar plexus. i supposed she would be fixing her camera to a tripod to take pictures of beautiful starry sky (but i did not actually see any camera or tripod) . that slender lady was about 5 feet and 7 inches tall and had black hair.\r\n  \r\nalthough i wondered why she was working in the darkness without any lights, i stepped back silently because she did not seem to have noticed that i was standing so close to her,and i did not want to surpise a young woman in the darkness. after that i kept standing for a while at some distance from her, but the next time i found that she was gone - disappeared without making any sounds of walking. in the camping site,i could hear footsteps very well even if they were more than 20 meters away.\r\n  \r\ni wondered where she had gone because i did not hear any sounds of car. it was too dangerous for anyone to leave the site on foot because there were wild bears often appear in that area. she was not looking up overhead but straight ahead to the east where the tokachidake mountains rises - and it was the very direction where the ufo appeard about one and half hours later.\r\n  \r\nalthough there is no certain links between that mysterious lady and the ufo, i have to say that i had seen another mysterious yong gentleman who suddenly disappeard before another ufo appeared in the sky when i was waiting for the chance to videotaple ufo on the beach of kamakura on february 25 in 2014.  at that time,i saw a large disk-shaped green ufo that circled over my head and flew away. i was so surprised to see the ufo at a such close range that i momentarily forgot about taking its picture even though i had my camra at hand. \r\n  \r\nhaving had such similar two experiences, i came to believe that the mysterious lady and the gentleman may have somthing to do with the ufos that appeared after these mysterious people disappered.\r\n\r\ni have videotaped night scenes with my digital camera many times but i have never seen any digital noises. on the other hand, i have heard from my friends that they had witnessed a strange bright object flying with the zigzag motion in hokkaido area which is one of the most famous ufo hot-spots in japan. \r\n\r\nfor the past several years, i have debunked many fake photos and videos as well as mistaken ufo reports, but it does not mean that i am a non-believer. i just wish to know the truth only. so i have conducted a camping in hokkaido which is very far from tokyo where i live. and fortunately i had opportunities to videotape the flying objects in 2010 and 2014 as you can see here\r\n \r\n\r\nufo with zigzag motion â€“ june 25, 2010 \r\n\r\nthis video was taken at 23:06 p.M. on june 25, 2010 at the foot of mt. tokachidake (an active volcano in the northern part of japan), which has been famous for ufo sightings for decades. near the bottom left corner of the video, you can see two lights showing zigzag motions, keeping the same distance between them. in the past, during the daytime around this area, my friend witnessed a strange oval object with two lights, one each on the left and the right edges, so i suppose that would be the reason for these two lights keeping the same distance. i fixed my camera position and did not follow the lights, so the zigzag motion of the object was not because of camera shake.\r\n\r\nalthough the lights were moving around a lower part of the sky, it does not mean they were close to the ground because i was standing on the plateau looking down the wild forest and valley below. the site was a kind of dangerous area where wild bears often appeared, so no one could fly an led night kite or anything else in the wild forest or valley in the middle of the night. the site was at an altitude of 1200 meters and the temperature was very low at night. it was completely dark and i could see many stars in the sky with the naked eyes, but my small digital camera (casio ex-h10) could not catch any starlight. so you can guess how bright that object actually was.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":58996,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.06461470000001,"location":null,"logNumber":"JP-08172014-0015","longitude":141.3468074,"occurred":1403677560000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Hokkaido

break so i decided to look out my 2nd floor window. as i am looking up, i noticed a dark flat silouette moving in the sky. i wasn't sure at first so continued to squint when all of a sudden i spotted a red light slowly fading in and out. this was confirmation something was up there. at first, i began to think, judging by the light, that it could be an airplane higher up in altitude, but no way. i can make out a much larger craft or ship by the edges as it eclipsed the bright stars. \r\ni stood in awe. it was surreal that i am witnessing this. even more astonished when i could not hear an engine. it was super-silent. unbelievable but i was convinced. this was no ordinary aircraft. this size of this black silouette had to be about 2 football fields in length. i never walked away from the window. my dad was asleep in the bedroom while my mom was in the shower so i could not alert them of what i was witnessing. plus, my excitement i remain glued to it because it was traveling between 5-10 mph. very slow and silent. \r\nit was traveling from north to northeast, from left to right in a straight path. \r\ni lost it over the trees nearby to my right. \r\nthe next day i

approaching our neighborhood in union kentucky. initially ,they were low at an altitude of about five hundred feet.The crafts were bright yellow with a leading edge of red lights panning back and forth as if scanning for something. occasionally the crafts would drop bright balls of fire like emissions from the rear. as the crafts came overhead, they ascended rapidly to an altitude of about 10,000 and climbing. one of the crafts would then go dark revealing it to be black and circular in shape. the crafts made no noise at all as they continued to climb northbound out of sight. as a retired police officer and an airline pilot of seven years, i can say that these were definitely not like anything i have seen before. i also have an extensive background in military aircraft.
