first sighting i was laying back soaking observing the clear sky  and marveling over how many stars i could see when all of a sudden i observed a bright orb appear from out of nowhere. it seemed to of just dropped in from a portal in the sky then it shot east. although it was only a matter of a split second i knew this wasn't a shooting star, aircraft, flare or comet because it was way to close and it moved deliberately and naturally unlike anything man made.  after the sighting i sat there a little long contemplating what i had just saw and grappling with the possibilities of what it could be and where it came from. i was compelled to go inside and wake my wife but i didn't want to freighter her so i just waited until the next morning to tell her. i told my sister about my experience and she advised me to report it to you but i didn't get around to it and just dismissed it as a coincident.\r\n\r\ni went out to my yard the following night and had a very relaxing soak without incident or encounter  but i definitely had the experience in the forefront of my mind. then the following night i did my same routine, i went out to my yard and got in my spa and soaked for a good hour and a half, again observing the night sky, marveling at the beauty of the stars. i wasn't really thinking about what had happened a few nights prior so it was just another pleasant evening to me but just before i started to exit the spa  just around the same time i do every night (11:30), when i looked up and another bright orb traveled across the sky from left to right giving me a chance to really observe what it was. at first i thought it may have been a flare but it move unlike fireworks or a projectile and it didn't arch either. it went straight across the sky, in clear sight, only a few hundred feet above me headed south this time, silent and it was almost angelic. needless to say i was stunned and i again grappled with what i had just witnessed. i attempted to rationalize the incident  and i called my sister immediately following, waking her up to tell her about my second sighting in less then a week. she again told me to report it to you but again i procrastinated. after waking up with this on my mind i thought it would be best to tell you my experience and allow you experts the opportunity to decipher the situation. i am open and receptive to an interview and would

wich was the craft hovering directly over the house with colors going in a circle the craft was no larger than the house we were living in at the time when i looked at everyone it seemed as if they were in slow motion and i got no response ever since then we've talked about it and thru research we found that no earthquake of that magnitude happened in that area during that time i need your

down into the water about 30 metres off the shoreline. as i watched a weird solid structure appeared in the sky above them to the north and moved slowly towards the beach. i thought at first it was a balloon but it was very solid and metal looking. i quickly grabbed my mobile phone and took a picture of it as it turned left and moved in an easterly direction. it looked like it had a pair of dipped wings or something hanging down from it on each side, but it was also a bit pointed at the front. it made a slight humming sound and it had white and blue lights that seemed to glow or pulsate. as it turned to the east they changed to a yellow colour. i would say that i watched it for approx 90 seconds and as it move down the coastline i did seem to change shape slightly. it then just disappeared about a mile away from my position on the beach. there were a couple on the beach who may have saw this too because they walked behind me as i was watching it. i think they were foreign though because they were quite tanned and spoke to each other with an accent so i didn't say anything to them. i am familiar with aircraft and this was 100% no helicopter or fixed wing craft! and certainly no

just finished walking and were sitting on the grass resting and talking. i noticed a few airplanes flying throgh the area a couple of times; however, there is an airport not too far away. we got in the car to leave, and as i was leaving the parking lot, i noticed directly in the sky looking towards the north, 3 orange fireball looking objects in the sky. we didn't hear any sound; they seemed to just glide through the air moving towards the east in formation. they would suddenly form a triangular formation, and then they would just kind of float apart. right away we noticed that this was something that we have never seen before. at first i thought maybe they were airplanes, but right away as we watched them move in the sky, you could tell that they were not airplanes as airplanes can't move around like these objects were moving. i stopped the car to take some photos with my iphone camera. we kept watching, and kept asking each other what do you think this is? neither one of us could figure out what these objects were, where they came from, how were they moving like they were in the sky? i turned the car around to go back into the parking lot to keep watching. they kept moving towards the east. there was a man and woman stopped on the trail looking up in the sky so we rode up to where they were and asked if they were looking at the objects and if they knew what they were. they both said they had no idea what the objects could be, and they seemed to be baffled as much as we were. then the objects just kind of disappeared. they were gliding along one moment and then all of a sudden they were gone. we didn't see them descending to land, or flying into the opposite direction, they just disappeared.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

balcony. and i saw 'it'. like a black shoe box, north of st pete but not as far. there was a rain cloud between it and st. pete, and a rain cloud between it and tampa to the north. the kind of localized cloud where you can see the rain falling. i said to my self \"holy s**t\". i was looking and scanning everywhere, \"they cant see it from tampa or st. pete\". it just sat there in the sky, i noted the time, looked inside and saw both of my kids cameras gone, still there hovering, i picked up my cell phone and took several pictures (not very good)i tried to estimate its size, comparing it to the tallest building in st. pete,. it looked to be twice the size of the tallest building i could see. i knew it wasn't as far away, but it was big. it hovered for about 20 minutes (i kept checking my watch). as the rain between it and st pete started to let up it moved in a straight line away from me and climbed, that only took a few seconds and was gone. i was beside my self, \"that wasn't one of ours\" i knew it, and in broad daylight this time. i know what i saw, i didn't imagine it. i made a sketch right after to show my kids what i saw. it was better than christmas when i was 5 years

just black but the light was on something, they actually started crying with fear. the next thing i remember we were back in my truck and the sun was coming up, it was just after midnight when we saw
