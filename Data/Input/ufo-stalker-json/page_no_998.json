cloud very slowly.There was only two clouds in the entire sky at that time each being roughly 1/2 mile from each other with this enormous craft flying from the first cloud towards the second cloud.The craft i saw was the size of an aircraft carrier and made no noise at all and seemed to be taking its time moving from one cloud to the next as if to be wanting me to see it.It was internally lighted like a light bulb would appear inside of a lamp shade.It would move some distance then almost stop as if it was going to move backwards but then move forwards some more then almost stop again until it was just about to reach the second cloud then it cloaked (disappeared) completely but not into the cloud or behind the cloud it (cloaked).I felt like electricity was running though my whole body after viewing it and felt really strange.This was in broad daylight at 9:30 pm and i just cannot understand why 911 wasn't flooded with calls because this craft appeared to be wanting to be seen at least by me and did everything it could to get my attention.The craft glowed very bright yellowish white that stood out in the sky and where i live should have been seen by thousands of people at this time of day but i seem to be the only one that witnessed it.There is absolutely no doubt at all what i saw that morning on august 13 2014.It was what people call a mother ship and it was using the the two clouds in the sky that day for cover even though after seeing it cloak it could be parked right over your house on a clear day and you would never know it was even there.I had a digital camera inside my house but i knew if i went to grab it i would miss this event so i just watched it.I really don't care if anyone believes any of this information i have given you but i know it is all true and i

over, my son was in the back seat of my car. a friend of mine visiting me came for the ride to drop him off.  upon driving down the residential road to his location of drop off, my friend in the front seat said to me she just thought she saw a meteorite and she pointed to the sky area where she was seeing this.\r\nmy son was in the back seat looking out the window now seeing this also repeated that's weird it is just sitting there not moving. \r\n\r\nbecause i could not see it being the driver i decided to pull over my car on the street and i got out to view what they were talking about. but at that moment at first i did not see any thing, suddenly it appeared again and my son was saying do you see that.  i could not believe how weird it was.  i was viewing a glowing yellowish colored round shape in the black sky, it was pitch black outside. it just sat there in the same spot for about 2 minutes not moving, hovering i guess you called it, then in a flash it shot sideways to the right sat there for about 5 to 6  seconds and then shot straight up and disappeared again for a about 10 seconds, then we saw it again and it just sat there in the same spot, it dropped down like a flash then back up and disappeared.  i was stunned and trying to figure out if this was possible to be a jet plane but i have never seen a jet plane before move in these kind of directions and there was no plane lights just a  kind of yellow glow and round in shape.  when my friend first saw it from the front passenger seat she stated to me that it had a tail like a meteorite but the tail

came across your site and decided to share this with you.  all i can say is i know this was not a plane and it was very strange. all i kept repeating was \" what the heck is that\"  my son too was freaked out.  on the way back to my house we kept looking to see if we could see it again but we did not. we could not stop talking about it after we got back home and i am sitting here still

carrying our 16 month old little boy walking out of our house to greet me. seconds later, before i could even fully get out of the car, i heard the baby say, \"what is that\"? as he pointed to the sky. i saw my wife look up where he was pointing, and her expression became very serious when she replied to our son, \"i don't know what that is\"!\r\n\r\nshe quickly turned to me and told me to come quickly and look. i thought she was probably seeing a meteorite or something, until i looked up to see a massive triangular craft hovering not that far from the top of the trees by our house. the object was very dark, with bright white lights, one situated on each of the three corners. it also had a large reddish light in the center, with at least two other white lights on one side. it appeared that these lights flashed intermittently, like a strobe light set at a low speed. \r\n\r\nwhat was most astounding to us was that the craft was completely silent. i was in disbelief that something that large and close would not make any sound. within a few seconds, the object started moving very slowly away from us towards the northeast, and eventually disappeared past the trees in the distance.\r\n\r\ni attempted to make a video of the craft, and based on what i was seeing on my i-phone, it appeared that i was not able to capture anything. later, i downloaded the video to our computer, and was amazed to see that the flashing lights were visible! i will include the video with this report.\r\n\r\nmy wife and i are well educated, and do not use any illegal drugs or alcohol. what we saw was so incredible that we stayed up most of the night talking about it. it was not any kind of plane i know of. i even looked up videos of stealth bombers at night, and there is no comparison to what we saw. my wife is scared because it was such a bizarre thing to see. i felt so exhilarated by the experience that i am awake at 2:00 am submitting this report, and i have to wake up early tomorrow for work. i cannot explain what it is that we witnessed, but i will never forget it. i also plan to research this topic extensively from this point on!","distance":"101-500

from the n, almost directly over me it seemed. as it got closer it got much brighter and looked like a meteor at first but it seemed get brighter as it appeared to get closer. there was reddish orange glow about the color of fire that grew brighter and dimmer. i ran inside to get my camera and managed to get a couple good pictures, i think. we watched the object for several minutes as it seemed to make a wide, arcing turn towards the east. it seemed to come to a stop and hover a couple times. also looked to be changing altitude. it flew slowly off to the south then seemed to climb and accelerate away out of view, passing close to our local airport. the tower crew would have to have seen this object as well, if not made a radar hit on it. we continued to stare skyward trying to make sense of what we just saw. suddenly the object appeared again-or another object approached from high altitude to the south. same strange light effects as the first time, only this time coming towards us from the south. again the object passed right by the airport and made a turn in our direction. it seemed like it slowed to a stop, not directly above us but very close. i never imagined my still photos would capture this object with any clarity but when i enlarged them i was very surprised to see just how clear the images are. you guys aren't going to believe it. after a minute or two the object began moving away to the east but then made an obvious change in direction back to the south and again seemed to accelerate and climb towards the south until it disappeared. after a few more minutes, the object appeared in the same manner and followed a very similar flight path as the last pass. about 5 minutes after the object disappeared two fighter jets overflew us, passing very close to the spot where i first saw the object. i thought it odd that they just flew over and away to wnw. my guess is the jets were from pope, sent to respond to a report from the atc at the airfield but the pilots were just a few minutes too late. the object or planes had not been sighted again by the time i gave up watching for more. please send someone to see me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

zoomed in to catch the object on film, and the girl at sonic opened her window to inform me they were just waiting on my sandwich to be done. i dropped the phone as she talked to me, but focused in on the flying object as soon as she left again. i watched this small spherical object fly just over the power lines, slowly, but consistently. i noticed a slight aura or field of sorts around the craft

there was an object that seemed to follow the path of the other object that flew from west to east.  when i pause my original vhs video, the object appears perfectly round...No wings, no appendages.  when looking at it in slow motion, it has some kind of an aura or halo effect around it, something that looks like turbulence.  toward the end of the video, there is a streak of light that passes from right to left that may be the object leaving at a high rate of speed.  also, at about 13 seconds into the video, there appeared to be another similar object that went across the screen from west to

no sound what so ever.  so i'm trying to look at it through the goggles and record it with the monocular at the same time.  as i'm watching it, i notice that as it's passing stars, i could see stars through the craft!!!!  i saw stars through the \"fuselage\" of the craft!!!  later, i confirmed this when i reviewed the video.  the craft was in the shape of a triangle.  there were two lights at the rear of the vehicle, circular, with a blinking light, also circular, almost between them, it was just a little above the two rear lights.  the light in front was shaped like a triangle itself, with a small, round light right behind it.  so all together, 5 lights.  i have, of course, seen planes through night vision goggles, helicopters, you can hear planes at 5000 feet, you can hear planes at 15,000 feet, 20,000 feet.  this thing was low and slow and silent!! even as it past over me and continued on.  i watched for a total of 8 minutes and 30 seconds.  when i first noticed it, again at about 75*, so if i saw it sooner, i might have seen it for 13-14 minutes?  the last weird thing that i noticed, was that when i took the goggles down for a second to get a barring as to where it was in the sky, i couldn't see any of the lights, not the fixed lights, not the single blinking light.  so either all the lights were very dim and the night vision enhanced them like they were made to do, or the lights were infrared, basically naked to the naked eye.  it flew out of sight, heading towards the south.  \r\nso to recap: \r\n1: it was silent.\r\n2: it was very slow moving.\r\n3: the lights were either very dim or infrared.\r\n4: i could see through it!!!  adaptive camouflage???  first time i've seen the real thing.\r\n5: i couldn't see it without night vision goggles.\r\ni will attach a \"freeze frame\" from the video.  if you would like to see the video, please let me know.
