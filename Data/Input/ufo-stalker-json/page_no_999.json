experiencing abduction with my boyfriend. i'm filling this out to maybe get help with my current situation dealing with ufo's and aliens. the first time i ever encountered a ufo i was sitting in my room watching hulu or netflix and just looking out my window. every other time i was out on a night walk (with my boyfriend and sometimes my dog would come with us, i don't go alone) or i happen to just look out my window and see it.\r\n2. i live in an area where there are quite a few hills/mountains, there is a visible cell tower right out front of my house on a large mountian. next to it there would appear to be a white flashing light on the mountian, i assumed  is was a  car driving up the mountian but i google maped it and there's no road to get up to it, it can only be accessed by a flying vehicle. the the light would quickly move upwards, then go left or right, then flash a green/ teal color and dissipate out of thin air and hover above my neighborhood or over a small airport i live next to. it does this nearly every night, and every night it seems to get closer and closer to my home.\r\n3. at first i thought it was a car, but then i immediately knew it was a ufo once i saw the way it moved and the colors it would turn.\r\n4. it seems to be a round object like a sideways oval with a round like shape on top. it has a total of five lights on it, 3 in the front, and two on the sides that flash. from a distance ( such as on the mountian i live in front of) the three lights on the front and the two on the sides mesh together and look like one big bright light. when it is close(such as hovering over my neighbors house) the lights on the front look red/orange/yellow, i've seen the ufo multiple times and the colors aren't always the same. also the two flashing lights turn off unless it's further away from my home/neighborhood (such as being over the small airport i live next to)\r\nthe light tends to move upwards off the mountian and move to the left or right then dissipate and i also see it dissipate instantaneously and appear in a different location. it will also hover in the same spot for several minutes or even hours then turn green and flash into a different area and the cycle will repeat over and over again all night. \r\n5. at first i was shocked because i never thought something like this would ever happen to me but now i'm completely used to it. what i'm not used to is aliens visiting my home. i've taken videos and photos of the object several times. \r\n6. i don't ever lose sight of it unless i go to sleep, i never see it during the day, otherwise it can look out my window at any time of night and it will be somewhere in my area visible from my home.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

cleared the mountain and narrowing toward the underside of the craft.I immediately focused on it, as it stopped and then proceeded to hover for about 3 or 4 minutes. i went in to the house to get my binoculars and returned but was still unable to see it clearly. i then thought of the video cam, and went in and got that. i tried to zoom several times but only made it blurry. the craft began to

also. this is the first sighting of this kind i have had since i moved here 15 years ago. the really strange part of this is that when i reviewed the video on my tv and not the camera, i clearly saw a

these before. i knew right away what it was. got home, had my camera in the car, so got it out right away. adjusted the settings, got one picture of it, as by that time was already over my house headed east. it was headed just to the right of the full moon. the moons light was so bright, that the orb just faded out in the light. i thought, oh darn, wanted to get more pics. i wanted it to come back. i took a couple more pics of the moon. it seemed like only 5 min. and i looked straight up, and another one was there. i got six or seven pictures of that one. it went on the same path, and faded out in the moons light, just as the other one did.  i thought it was no chinese lantern, as there was not much wind. moved too fast for a lantern, and what's the chance it was on the exact same flight pattern as the first. too slow for a plane, and no blinking lights. i could have sworn i only waited about 5 min. when the second one went over. but when i went to up-load my photos, the time

guessing it was between 12-1am. we both looked up around the same time, no reason to- just did. and we saw a stream of bright lights in the form of a triangle. we were both saying \"what's that?\".... and suddenly the lights (still as a triangle) begin zooming erratically through the sky. it was nothing we had ever seen before- no way possible was it a human aircraft. then we noticed a few single bright lights nearby. we were panicked so we both just ran. as far as i know, nothing (like an abduction) happened to us. i remember it clearly even today and my heart races as i type this. \r\nthe reason i'm just getting this out now is i've been having odd events happening to me the past year... hearing bell like noises in my mind (as i was in band i'm familiar with instruments and this sound is unlike any human noise i've hear) as well as the waking up at 12:12, 1:11, 2:22, 3:33 & 4:44 phenomena happening. i don't know if this is a spiritual awakening or something else happening to me.

to which she said she could always tell the difference.  so i put her to the test and started pointing out different points of light and asking her which was which and she got all of them right. i was amazed.  and then i pointed out another \"star\" and she hesitated.  when i asked her \"what, you don't know?\" she replied \"it's gone.\" i then looked again and couldn't find what i had pointed out to her however, i was driving and had to pay attention to the road also for there was a lot of traffic. soon @ that however my gf got very quiet and slid down in her seat and clutched herself as if she were cold (even though it was a warm night).  when i asked her what was wrong she said, \"i don't know what that is\" pointing to the sky.  when i looked (bewildered at what she was talking @) i could see nothing and then (@ a short while) i got it.  there was a large space where we could see no stars, nothing but a blank space where stars should have been.  so i pulled on to the shoulder and stopped to get a better look.  {when i stopped we were on the 2nd or 3rd hill past the army airfield}  i got out of the car and told my gf to come out and see this but she refused acting very scared at the thought of doing so.  and so i alone watched this \"blackness\" coming toward us.  as this \"blackness\" approached me: almost directly up the highway: (you understand the highway was very bright w/headlights going both ways w/people returning home @ a holiday)and as it got closer i perceived it to be shaped like a blimp but it was moving sideways, not like a blimp at all.  i watched this \"blackness move over the top of me and noticed that it had 2 small lights, one red and one green at either \"end\".  by extrapolating where the lights were in relation to me and how high the \"mass\" was above me i guessed that it was @ 500 feet long.  @ passing me it continued to follow the highway until it got to almost to the hill below which would have been the airfield and then  it turned to the sw and soon disappeared having never seemed to be in a hurry, just kind of floating.        however, the most interesting thing @ this encounter happened just after the \"mass\" passed over me.  i watched it the whole way but as it was just past me i observed (at what i thought was about 2/3 of the way up on the east facing side what i can only describe as a \"window\", a bit longer at the bottom than at the top and thus sloping upwards as one would imagine a window to look in the upper portion of a \"blimp\"shape. and it seemed to be back lighted for in that \"window\", was a shape;  as if a person was trying to cup their eyes to see out from a lighted space into the darkness beyond.  i know how i do that and the configuration of this shape was the same; torso and head in the middle, arms out to the sides in a semi-triangular shape cupping the eyes.  just like a child defying parents and doing a \"forbidden\" thing.  i thought @ the time; wow, they have the same probs w/children as we have.  but from now; ain't it a hoot.  p.S. degrees above the horizon?  how @ a couple hundred feet above my head. which says nothing @ the horizon. so why can i not get out of here w/out answering a question which has nothing to do w/my sighting? redo your q&a                                                                      ","distance":"21-100

starry sky. i didn't hear anything. i watched it for about 20-30 seconds and it appeared to be moving slowly, blimp-like. then, it either disappeared, or became completely invisible to me. i could not
