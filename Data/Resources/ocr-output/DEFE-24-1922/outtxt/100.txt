Dear Sit, e 28th September 1984

Ref: Unusual light formation seen over Leeds, 23rd July 1984
with regard to the above incident. We are now in receipt, some seven
weeks after requesting data, the Ministry of Defence's denial that they
were in some way involved with the lights seen by many members of the
public over Leeds, and surrounding districts that night.

our enquires believe that the opposite is true, that either Gazzelle or
Lynx helicopters, from locations we have been in touch with, were involved
in the testing of some form of powerful are light, probably of the same
nature used by Bedfordshire police in their hunt for the man known as the
'Fox'. We require a statement, given that we have collected enough data
for this serious matter to be raised by the local authority in the form

of the Leeds & Bradford Airport Authority, which will confirm our findings.

If the nature of the tests are so sensitive, then why carry them out over
a city with a 750,000 plus population, and where we, as a Society will
research the incident until the truth is known? I am aware that if proven,
then prosecutions could result, for breaking Civil Aviation Authority
rules about airspace etc. That is not for me to decide, what I am eager
to do, is resolve who flew over the area that night, in what, why it was
there at all, and just what on Earth is really going on with the continued
shuttle service from the South of England northwards? If answers are to
be forthcoming, I will be grateful, if not, then we shall continue with
our efforts, through various quarters, until then, I remain,
