the above address looking out towards Otley Chevin, which

~is to the South of Otley, when she saw an object which she

describes as disc shape and spherical, and larger than a
distbin lid. . No lights were displayed on the object and it
appeared to be moving under power as opposed to drifting
about in the sky. "ilk

I informed both ladies that to the best of my knowledge when
aircraft took off or landed from Yeadon Airport they cleared
The Chevin at approximately 500 feet, and I asked them if the
object was as high in the sky as this. | ___ s
me that it was lower.

Whilst watching the object I-was informed that the sun was
not shining, however, it appeared to them to be a dull grey
colour but when either the- underside or topside was in view
it glinted with a metallic effect.

When the object- was first gine it was to the South of Otley
and was below the skyline of Otley Chevin. . The object then
travelled towards the North East, that is right across the
Wharfedale Valley in the direction of a small radio mast
situated near Almscliffe Crag. Whilst watching the object
they saw it turn round travel back across the valley in a
Southerly direction. over ploughed fields in front of
Farnley Hall, and appeared to land in an area known as
Enotford Nook.

Both ladies did not actually see the object land as at this
point their view was obscured by trees. They then returned
inside the house, '

At 15.30 hours the same day, I spoke to the Air Traffic
Controller at Yeadon Airport, who informed me that at the
