Dear. Sir, -
~* Report 'of Unidentified Object
Please find enclosed UFO report from fGociion 40 - |
This report was initially relayed to ATC Dunsfold by oa
fianc√©e who is a employee at Dunsfold. -It was g
passed by. teleph ary as I considered the time delay from --

observation 'to receipt of the report at Dunsfold. would not constitute l
'immediate' report.

  

The Dunsfold radar controller on duty at the time of the reported .
observation does not recall seeing anything unusual on: radar in the |
vicinity of Horsham at the appropriate yiues

Yours faithfully,
