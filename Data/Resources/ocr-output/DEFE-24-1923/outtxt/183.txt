Dear Sir/Madam,

We have recently received a report
from a headmaster and his family, of an unidentified
Object in the Burnley area, This object was observed
originally as a very bright light over Brierfield, at
B1. iShrs, Jan 23rd, 1985, As they watched it moved
slowly towards them at an estimated height of 500ft,
1% continued slowly in a direction before dissppearing
out of sight, Its direction of travel then was HSW to
88%. Total observation time fifteen minutes,

None of the witnesses heard any sound, even when
it passed over the house, and its shaps and display of
lights was inconsistent with a conventional sircraft.
Nevertheless, we would be gratefull if you could check
aircraft movements at that time and date, and inform
us'of your findings, Could it have been a balloon of
some sort ?

We would be pleased to identify this unidentified,
if there is a logical explanation, I look forward to
your reply in anticipation,
