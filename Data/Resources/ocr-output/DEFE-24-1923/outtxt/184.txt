Dear Sin,

I enclose a statement from (oe a :- Pencader,
Dyfed regarding a U.F.0. sighting which she made on 16th February 1985

and also on the following night.

 

However I am not asking for any classified information to be
divulged to me, but I would just like to reassure
that they did in fact see something that was not a natural phenomenon
(aurora, heavenly body etc.) but that whatever it was, it did not originate
from a foreign country or indeed from outer space!

I would only add that ~ Ro are old friends of many
years standing, and are most reliable and level-headed witnesses.

I would be most grateful for any reassurances along the above
lines that can be given to me. a

Yours faithfully,
