UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

Reference:
A. RNAS Culdrose 243/173 dated 13 Sep 85

You will have seen a copy of Reference A
which follows up a UFO report received from
LATCG by signal. In view of the unusual nature
of this report, and particularly in the light
of the statement at para 'K' of ref, I should
be grateful for your views on the need for
further action.
