"_ I live at the above address but on Saturday, 16th November 1985,

(C.J. Act, 1967, s 9, I was visiting my mother and father o Cowcliffe,
M.C. Act, 1980, s 102,

M.C. Rules, 1981, Â£ 706 Huddersfield.

o- situated at the top of a hill and overlooks the

valley in which Huddersfield Town Centre is situated. Directly
across is a range of hills that make the opposite wall of the
valley. Slightly to the right is Castle Hill. The house faces
South. There are no nearby objects.

About 8.20 pm on this day as a result of something my. mother

said I looked towards the window and saw in the sky about an angle of
30 degrees above the eye level, two bright lights close together
car headlights. The objects were brighter and larger then

the stars but not as large as a full moon. They were the brightest
things in the sky at the time. I could not tell if these lights

were attached to an object because the lights were top bright.

when I first saw these objects I was indoors looking through the
window. The objects were at first stationary.

The lights appeared to be beyond the opposite valley wall. I
opened the window and the lights were exactly the same when I had
first seen them.
