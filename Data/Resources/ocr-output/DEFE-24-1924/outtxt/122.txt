WEST YORKSHIRE METROPOLITAN POLICE

 

Sheet No.

 

The lights stayed stationary for about four to five minutes.

After this time the lights seemed to move directly towards me.

The lights did not seem to get bigger or brighter but seemed to move
at a very fast speed, quicker than an ordinary aeroplane would
travel when seen at their normal height. The movements lasted about
one minute and then stopped. They appeared to stop over the

town centre of Huddersfield.

The two lights then zizzagged to the left and then to the right.

The objects then disappeared just like switching off a light.

There-was a thin streak, weak light left in there place. This
was not like the after image you get after looking at a bright
light.

At no time could I see any object attached to these lights.
The two lights stayed close together in relation to each other.
The total duration of this sighting lasted about 8 to 10
minutes.

The weather during the sighting was fine. There were few clouds
in the sky.

I have not seen anything like this before or since.
