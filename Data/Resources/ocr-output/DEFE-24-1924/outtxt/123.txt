M.C. Rules, 1981, r 70) Section 40
On Saturday, 16th of November 1985, I was at home in my lounge watching

 

 

 

 

the television. It was about 8.20 pm, I know the time because I was
watching 3-2-1 on television.

At this time I could see out of my lounge window, and had an excellent
view of the sky over Huddersfield in a southerly direction.

My attention was drawn from the television to two bright white lights
shining in the sky directly in front of our house, and I would say
to the East of Castle Hill, over Almondbury. The lights were well
clear of the land horizon. I could see Castle Hill light and it

was lower than the lights in question.

The lights were like a pair of car headlamps very bright and close

together. They remained still in the same position for a few minutes

so I called my husband and two daughters, C
cm- visiting us.

When I first observed the lights I was sitting still in an armchair.

I then went to the window and called my asst

to have a look at the lights.

 

The light remained in position without moving for about five minutes.

Statement taken by: I opened the lounge window and looked at the lights without the

foci is | restriction of the window.

Telephone numbers and witness availability to be endorsed overleaf.
