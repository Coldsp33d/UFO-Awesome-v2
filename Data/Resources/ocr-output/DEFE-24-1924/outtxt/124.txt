STATEMENT OF:

 

hees ___,

The lights suddenly started moving at what appeared to be a
terrifc speed straight towards us, the lights got larger

and brighter.

The lights reached a point I would estimate to be over Huddersfield
town centre when the lights suddenly moved slightly to my left

and then back to its original position and then slightly to the
right. These movements were very jerky and sudden and the distance
moved on each occasion was not very great.

At this point I went out into the garden and observed the lights
from a standing position and listened for aircraft noise, but
there wasn't any.

The lights then got really bright in the sky and then suddenly

the lights disappeared as if they had been switched off, leaving
« pencil line of light across the sky, Bast to West.

From first seeing the lights and its disapearing I observed it for
approximately ten minutes in total from different positions and
on each uccasion I was stationary. I did not use any bincculars
or telescope but just used the naked eye.

I do not wear glasses and have excellent eye sight.

I, nor any of my family, had been drinking prior to the sighting.
My house is situated on a high hill to the north of Huddersfield
town centre with no objects or buildings to block our view over
Huddersfield town centre and the hills to the south.

I would estimate the lights appeared in the sky approximately 30
degrees up from our location.

At the time of the sighting the weather was clear and fine,
