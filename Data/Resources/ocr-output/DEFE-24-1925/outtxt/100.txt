1. We discussed this subject briefly on the

telephone. I attach copies of references A and
B which explain the background to the enclosed
photographs. Although I don't think this can
-properly be regarded as a UFO sighting, there
might conceivably be a defence interest and I
would therefore be grateful for your expert
comments on the photographs and their contents.

2. As you will see, the AAC have asked that
the 55 mm negatives are returned in due course,.
