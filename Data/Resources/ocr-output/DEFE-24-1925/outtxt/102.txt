UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS - MEETING WITH LORD HILL-NORTON:
THURSDAY 10 OCTOBER 1985

You were very kindly present when Lord Trefgarne met Lord Hill-
Norton at 11 am at UKLF on Thursday 10 October to discuss
Unidentified Flying Objects.

Lord Trefgarne opened the discussion by explaining that there
was a central secretariat within the Ministry of Defence, part
of whose responsibility was to act as a focal point for the

report of unidentified sightings. Their task was to consider
whether there were any defence implications from such reports.

Lord Hill-Norton emphasised that he believed quite sincerely
that there was a problem of UFOs. He had considered for a
number of years that the MOD's response to reported sightings
had been unsatisfactory.

Specifically he cited the incident at Woodbridge in 1980 and
criticised the alleged refusal by MOD to acknowledge the presence
of Lieutenant Colonel Halt's report for 24 years. He referred
to a number of papers released in the United States under the
Freedom of Information Act which had been carefully examined in
the United States, and which he considered would be of interest
to the MOD. He also referred to a book due to the published
shortly which is anticipated to be critical of the MOD in this
area.
