MEETING BETWEEN MINISTER(DS) AND LORD HILL-NORTON

UFOs

 

a. I accept that there are strange phenomena to be seen in the
sky, however I believe there to be adequate explanations for them.
Experience has shown that most reported sightings can be attributed
to things such as aircraft, meteorological balloons or natural
phenomena like ball lightning. Of course there are many other
equally straightforward explanations. However, there are a small
number of cases where a simple explanation cannot be found
immediately and on these occasions we are careful to ensure so far as
possible that that they are of no Defence significance. Having
satisfied surseives of this, as you know, we do not sttenpt say
further investigations. Clearly some reports remain unexplained but
we have found no evidence that these phenomena represent a threat to
national security and therefore cannot justify devoting Defence

resources to their investigation.

b. All reports received by the MOD are channelled through
Sec(AS)2. They are passed to the Air Staff who examine them for Air
Defence implications. In some cases, where (on the face of it) there
could be a defence interest, enquiries are made of relevant radar

, establishments ete in order to obtain more information,. All reports
are also passed to. the Defence Intelligence organisation who have a
keen interest in any sightings of ubusual objects. ' We have no '

group in Whitehall or anywhere else involved in UFO's and

  

1lian advisers other than Sec(A8}2 are involved.
