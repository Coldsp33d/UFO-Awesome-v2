The Flying Complaints Flight at Rudloe Manor are concerned
with receiving and investigating flying complaints. In the course of
their duties they occasionally receive UFO reports (as do many other

units) but they have no specific role with regard to this subject.

Secretariat (Air Staff) is the Division which provides
secretariat support to CAS and the Air Staff and in this capacity is
responsible for correspondence with members of the public and
answering PQs etc on many subjects, including UFO's. Sec(A8)2 is the
branch which amongst other things handles UFO's, there is no such
branch as Air Staff Secretariat 8. You may be thinking of Defence
Secretariat 8 which no longer exists and from which See(AS) evolved

as a result of reorganisation of MOD last January.

c. Many of the UFO reports received in MOD come through Defence
establishments, although most of these come originally from members
of the public. Very few reports are made 'by military pilots; for
instance, in the last 12 months Sec(AS) has received only two such

reports.

d. No central record of radar recordings is kept. Major Air
Traffic Control units take recordings as a matter of sÂ§Ur8e, however
these are generally destroyed after 30 days. ADGE units do not
regularly make recordings although some are occasionally made for
specific operational purposes. Relevant radar units are consulted

' where necessary as part of the normal process of handling UFO reports

in order to ascertain whether there is any correlation between a

reported: sighting and known radar traces.
