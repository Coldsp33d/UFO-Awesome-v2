RAF WOODBRIDGE INCIDENT 27 Dec 80

Col Halt's report of 13 Jan 81 concerns the sighting of
unusual lights outside the back gate at RAF Woodbridge by two
security patrolmen. Col Halt records what was subsequently reported
to him without comment. The 3 patrolmen who went into Rendleshanm
Forest to investigate what they thought might be a crashed aircraft
say they saw a triangular object. It has been suggested that this
might have been a piloted vehicle, however in view of its reported
size (about 9 feet long and 6 feet high) this was, and still is,
considered highly unlikely. Indeed enquiries made both at the time
and subsequently failed to reveal any radar trace of anything unusual

in the area at the time.

Col Halt also reports on his own investigations at the site of
the incident the following day. Once sists he draws no conclusions
from his findings and, significantly, does not recommend further
investigation. Our own view also was that no additional action was
required. Later on the night of 29 Dec 80 Col Halt and a number of

others saw more unusual lights, but again we have no record of

anything untoward being picked up on radar.

I think you will agree that it is highly unlikely that any
violation of UK airspace would be heralded by such a display of
lights. -I think Lt equally unlikely that any reconnaissance or

spying activity would be announced in this way.
