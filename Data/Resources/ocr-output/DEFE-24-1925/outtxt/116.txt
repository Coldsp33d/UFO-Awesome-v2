Overall, we believe that the fact that Col Halt did not report
these occurrences to MOD for almost 2 weeks after the event, together
with the relatively low key manner in which he handled the matter
(given resources available to Him) are indicative of the degree of
importance in defence terms which should be attached to the incident.
He himself took all investigative action which was required. If
members of the public feel that for scientific or other reasons,
there should be an attempt to establish the cause of what happened,
that is for them, but I am confident that it is not something in

which the MOD should or need become further involved.
