sussen - Unexplained Lights

10: RAFZCC

1. Early in the morning of 27 Occ 80 (approximately O300L}, two USAF
security police patrolmen saw unusual lights outside the back gate at
RAF Woodbridge. Thinking an aircraft might have crashed or been forced j
down, they called for permission to go outside the gate to investigate. -
The on-duty flight chief responded and allowed three patrol to Pro-
ceed on foot. The individuals reported seeing a strange glowing object P
in the forest. The object was described as being metalic in appearance
and triangular in shape, approximately two to three meters across the
base and approximately two meters high. It illuminated the entire forest
with a white light. The object itself had a pulsing red light on top and
a bank(s) of blue lights underneath. | The object was hovering or on legs.
As the patrolmen approached the object, it maneuvered through the trees
and disappeared. At this time the animals on a nearbyfarm went into a
frenzy. The object was briefly sighted approximately an hour later near
the back gate. p

 

2. The next day, three depressions 1 1/2" deep and 7" in diameter were
found where the object had been sighted on the ground. The following
night (29 Dec 80) the area was checked for radiation.  Beta/gamma readings
of 0.1 milliroentgens were recorded with peak readings in the three de-
pressions and near the center of the triangle formed by the depressions.

A nearby tree had moderate (.05-.07) readings on the side of the tree
toward the depressions.

3. Later in the night a red sun-like light was seen through the trees
It moved about and pulsed. At one point it appeared to throw off glowing
particles and then broke into five separate white objects and then dis-
appeared. Immediately thereafter, three star-like objects were noticed
in the sky, two objects to the north and one to the south, all of which
were about 10% off the horizon. The objects moved rapidly in sharp angular
movements and displayed-red, green and blue lights. The objects to the
north appeared to be elliptical through an 8-12 power lens. They then
turned to full circles. The objects to the north remained in the sky for
an hour or more. The object to the south was visible for two or three
hours and beamed down a stream of light from time to time. Numerous indivi-
ale including the undersigned, witnessed the activities in paragraphs
and 3.
