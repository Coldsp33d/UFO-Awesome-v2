Dear Siz or Madam,

  

I am writing to you again,after writing to you in
for information and possible explanation into a reported 'U.P.0. sighting
at St Mawgan,in Cornwall, This event occurred during early February this year.

My first line of enquiry was to the B.A.F. Base at St Mavgan, in
Hay,and they forwarded my two letters to your Department,after consultation
with HQ and Provost Security Services (U.K.). The E.A.F. Bese informed me,
that I would be hearing from you im due course,.

After waiting for some three months I wrote to D.9.8,in Augast,but

since then,I have heard that 5.9.8. ,has been terminated.and upon gairing this
mews,L felt it responsible to wzite to the Ministry of Defence agais.

Should my previous letters be in your possssiom,you will be avere of
this incident.Sbould my letters mot be in your will briefly put
om paper the event.

In February,at 5.45pm a 28year old lady was driving down a country
lane,near Howguay. Quite suddenly she was confronted by a bright yellow
light,which babbed and weaved over the road in fromt of her,and also slong
the alongside each side of the road. The light changed shape and
coloux;to the size of a football and a beight luminous green,vith a red
glow in the centre of i%, It then changed to a purplish colour,prior to it's
exit,into a thick hedgerow, Maturally,the witness was unaware of any sound
being made from the phenomenon because of her attention of the ford - her
speed varied from 20x.p.k. to 50m.p.b. which helps us with the distance
it followed her,becmise she states the sighting's time duration was four
miuates, Therefore, the maximum distance i% followed her was 3°33 miles
(5*36km),the minimum distance was L 4miles (2+25km).Because of the erratic
changes of speed due to her surprise whilst driving,we have estimated the
average speed at 35m.p.h.,vhich would give us a digtance it followed her was
2.3 miles (3-Tim).

Discussing the incident with the wituess,there is a possibility,thet
this 'light® could have penetrated the inside of St Mevgan,without
any challenge from the authorities there, We beleive the "light" may have
then travelled in the area of Truro.

At the time,I was living in Plymouth when 1 fixst approached the

Air Force Base,and operated a Research Organisation, tige
