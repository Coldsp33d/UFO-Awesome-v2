my two letters to the Base would have been on headed letter
writing paper. I have since then moved to Cheshire on a permanent footing

and I wrote to R.A.F. St Mewgan informing them of this,so they could inform
yourselves.

In April and May,FUFOIC staff examined closely the youte that the
'light" took, in case any damage had occurred to the natural or man made
habitat in that area.We did this because of the closensie the 'light'
travelled by,during the sighting. Tais included some cottages that were
oceupied,a barn and a barn type building,used to store farming equipment,.
(The witness stated the 'light' reflected an orange glow on a white cottage
wall). The 'light' also flew over the hedgerow and some trees in the locality.
In our examination of these areas,we discovered some burnt patches of ground
on a track leading to a field,and some burnt amall trees.At first we thought
thege might have been caused by the 'light*;showever since then we have
excluded this theory. We also discovered a treo,which has been hit by am
airborne object, because mbst of it's upper branches have been ripped off.
The 'smap' marks on the branches are all similar indlosting the damage was
done by ome incident.OGar photographs show this damage very clearly.

Observation of aircraft activity over this area,does mot help with any
conclusion as to the nature of this 'light*.All sizeraft are mich too high
in altitude to have damaged the thee,

One theory we have made is that it could have beem an experimental
axevoise from R.A.F. St Mawgen,however if this is correct,then there is some
concern to the safety of property and even people in this locality.If this
theory is correct, them any correct proceedures designed for the exercise
were followed grossly incorrectly,and should not be allowed to happen again,
Another theory is that of a missile experiment,.which if correct,went
horribly wrong.If the 'light' was a genuine *U.F.0.* them a question we must
ask,.is "Way did it go unchallenged in an area less than one mile from the
Base?".

Our investigations into this sighting have involved several people,
and they,including myself,and some of the local people where this incident
scourred are somewhat concermed at the safety aspect and potential dangers
this incident might have caused.

This sighting is one of five,being discussed at a major Conference
in the Horth ~ West in October,and we would be most gratefull if you could
ecknowledge and reply to my letters to both you,and the R.A.F. I feel that
a wait of nearly three months for & reply from an Official Government body
is a little 'alow' to say the least. I would not vaste my own time,and yours
if a mere 'light in the sky'Shad been observed and reported to us.l am quite
sure you will agree with mo,that this incident is not such a case,and does
qualify for these letters to you, Again,1 request urgent action to my letter
because of the delay so far.

Yours Faithfull
