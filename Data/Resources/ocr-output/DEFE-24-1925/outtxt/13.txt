POSSIBLE UFO - HEATHROW AIRPORT AREA
Thank you for your letter of 7 May 1986, addressed to Air Traffic Control.

I regret to say I am not able to help you. I have looked in the ATC log for
2 April 1986 but nothing untoward was reported, around noon or during that

day.

I have therefore forwarded your letter and contents-to the Ministry of Defence
(APO) Division 8 in London. That Department deals with reports on UFOs and if
you have any further information please send it to them at Main Building,
Whitehall SWIA | 2HB.

Yours. sincerely

40
