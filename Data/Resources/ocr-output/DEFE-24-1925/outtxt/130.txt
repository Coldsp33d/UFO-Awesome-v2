FILMS FOR PROCESSING FOR SEC (AS) 2 RAF

Reference
A. - My D/DAAC/23/GA dated 6 Aug 85

1. Ref A accompanied negatives of an unusual sighting near Middle Wallop and
asked that prints and negatives be forwarded +o - PRINCIPLE SEC
{AS) 2-RAP and that copies be sent to Middle Wallop for the cival photographer
whose film it was. -

2. During my- absence on leave a packet of photographs was received here and
was passed .on to the photographer, however, it would appear that SEC (AS) 2
have not seen them. Could you confirm whether or not prints and negatives were
forwarded to them. A telephone call would suffice. *
