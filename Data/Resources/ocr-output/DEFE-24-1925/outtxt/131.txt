Thank you for your letcer requesting information about the Royal Naval Air Station
Yeovilton and our satellite airfield at Merryfield..

Aeronautical information regarding radar services, terminal approach procedures and
altimeter setting procedures for Yeovilton are available in Aevonsutical Publications.
These are available from commercial sources. These procedures also govern the case
of Merryfield which is used solely by our helicopters.

Yeovilton is the headquarters airfield for Sea Harriers and front line Commando
helicopters. We also operate Hunters, Canberras and Falcon mircraft along with

Hevon communication sircraft and aircraft of the Royal Navy Historic Plight. I would
recommend a visit to the Fleet Air Arm Museum bere at Yeovilton where more information
on Naval aiveraft is availabie.

I wish you luck with your UPO sightings
