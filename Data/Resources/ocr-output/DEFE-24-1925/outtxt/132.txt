I understand that you handle reports and enquiries about UFOs, so although
I feel a bit silly about wasting your time, I amjust a bit curious to know, if.
possible, 'about womething which appeared in the sky at about 9.45 near the GLC
Fireworks display on Saturday night, which I attended.

When we arrived we went over to the North Bank to get a good view of the
fireworks, which was very successful and we enjoyed. | We were walking back from
the north bank to the South bank over the Hungerford Pedestrian Bridge, and noticed
in the distance, just above the South Bank buildings about 300 yards down the
river (we were looking at it from approx. the centre of Hungerford Bridge) on Tee RET 4
shrt of long shimmering light. | It was in the sky, and moving ever so slightly *".
but not making any progress, hovering. It was "sparkly" ard thin, and did not
have any shape, i.e. it was not an seroplane or a helicopter. Lots of people
were pausing to watch it, and no-one knew what it was. I% has remained a question
mark in my mind, and I am just curious to bear if you know what it was, or if
you have bad any other reports of sigle such a sighting. I don't suppose other
people have the time to write to you, but I am a housewife so I do! My son is
curious about unusual objects in the sky, as he has personslly seen a couple himself
for which he bas no explanation. Ke bas seen this thing before, over Charing Cross
Road, and on that occasion all his friends agreed they had never seen anything like
it before. Â©

I am very aware that it could have been part of the GLC display - but it was
Just on its omn, did mot logically fit in with anything there, and was not announced.
I thtught maybe it was some sort of a balloon painted with flourescent paint, and put
up just for a lark, but it was very brilliant and shimmery.... L-am still very curious!

Have you had any other reports such as I have described? If so, I would be pleased>
if you could let me have a short mote as to what it was, or amy other explanation
you may have. - %

*~ Thank you for reading this letter - there is a diagram on the back ~
for you to see.

Yours sincerely
