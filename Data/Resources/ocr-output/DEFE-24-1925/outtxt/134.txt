Thank you very much indeed for your helpful letter of 22 August last.

Since you have been kind enough to let me know that the MoD received one RAF
report of a UFO in 1967, and that you are happy to reply to specific individual
replies within reason, T would be very interested to know the date and approx-
imate location of this sighting. < While details would be appreciated, I assume
these would naturally be withheld under provisions of the 30-year rule.

With best wishes

Yours sincerely
