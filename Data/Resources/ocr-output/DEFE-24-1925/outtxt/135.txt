bear sins,
1 have been involved in an investigation regarding

the recent appearence of mysterious circles which have been found in crop

fields throughout southern sngland. whilst studying various press cuttings
and listening to the 4V and redio reports 'P have heard that the Ministry Of
Defence has shown some interest in this phenomena, or ableast the army has

 

passed on reports to you.

in one particular report, which appeared in the Salisbury
Journal, it was stated that at middle Wallop a ' white jelly - like
flourescent substance' was found and that samples were taken for analysis.
As yet 1 have been unable to trace any further mention of this in respect
of the results of this analysis. .

I wonder therefore if there is any information with regard
to this that you could pass onto me. Although a great many people are of the
opinion that there is either a perfectly naturel explanation, or it is a
prank my investigations to date have shown that about two or three days
before the circles sppeared there were reports of unidentified flying objects.
whe people who have reported such sightings, both to me and in some cases
the press, are not assuming that these are alien craft ( ie flying saucers },
but the objects are certainly defying explanation at the moment in that they
do not appear to be any known airbourne craft, The same can be said of the
reports which have come from Americe, New Zealand, Australia and various
other parts of the world in the past.
