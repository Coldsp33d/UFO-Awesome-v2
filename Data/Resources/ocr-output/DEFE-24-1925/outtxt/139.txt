Thank you for your letter of 5 August 1985,
The existence of a tape, allegedly recorded at
RAF Woodbridge and referring to reported events
there in December 1980, has been brought to our
attention by UFO researchers on- a number of Â°
occasions. However we have no record of this
tape having been submitted to this office,
either formally or otherwise. As we have said
previously, the only information we have on the
alleged incident is the report submitted by Col
Halt on 13 January 1981.
