UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS - CENTRAL TELEVISION iNTERVIEW

i f My staff spoke to you on Friday evening about a request from
Central Television to conduct an interview with a member of MCD,
preferably a Minister, for. inclusion in a 45 minute piece on UFOs
which they propose. soreening in "Central Weekend", a 11/2 hour
current affairs shown on Sundeys in the Central TV area.
The producers are, as yet, unsure of the actual date of the
broadcast. We promised to let you have fuller information about the
programme when it was to hand.

a

2. .The programme will be based on a series of interviews inter-

spersed 'with film, taken from public roads, of some MOD establish=

ments which are assumed to be of significance in UFO circles.

Interviewees will include Lord Bill-Herton and an ex-800. employee 40)
who worked at Boscombe Down during the 1950's and who

claims to have seen a UFO .in 1952; You may wish to pote that,

'because of his officlel status at the tise, Ro-: been in

touch with this office, independently, about taking part in the

programme. We have advised him thet, as a private citizen, the

decision to take part must bei his own but that the MOD would have no

objection to him doing. so.

 

 

3. The proposed interview with Minister(DS) would last perhaps 15
minutes which, when edited, will provide 2-3 minutes of {V time. . The
interview would take the form of specific questions upon which we
would," of .course, provide briefing. The questions are expected to
include: our explanation of the strange phenomena which occur in. the
sky; the seriousness with which HOD treats reports of incidents;
whether MOD is the. sole authority in Whitehall which receives reports
or whether they are passed on to abother more clandestine organisa-
tion; < and the incident im December 1980 at RAF Woodbridge. Central
Television have indicated: that the interview can take place at
Minister's convenience 'but they would preferably wish it to be within
a- fortnight.
