o e

Thank you for your letter of 19 June 1985, I have also seen
your letter of 27 July. I am sorry that I have been unable to reply
before now. You asked in your first letter for information on four
UFO sightings; I am afraid that I have had little success in
locating any information on those incidents. In fact, the only
report I have been able to identify is one referring to two objects
observed in the Humberside area in July 1984. I enclose a copy of
the report although, as you will see, the information provided is
scant, The name and address of the informant (sub-paragraph M) have
been deleted since these reports are submitted to us in confidence.

Without more explicit details I could not identify the
daylight report allegedly made to RAF Fylingdales in the summer of
1980, however our records indicate that no reports were forwarded to
us from the unit during that period. I have checked our records for
September 1976 and June 1980 but can find no reference to ¢ither of
the remaining sightings you refer to.

I am sorry that I have been unable to be of more assistance on
this occasion,
