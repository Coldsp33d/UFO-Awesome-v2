Col. 62

RAF Woodbridge (Alleged Incident)

Sir Patrick Wall asked the Secretary of State for
Defence (1) if he has seen the United States Air Force
memo dated 13 January 1981 concerning unexplained
lights near RAF Woodbridge;

(2) whether, in view of the fact that the United State's
Air Force memo of 13 January 1981 on the incident at RAF
Woodbridge has been released under the Freedom of
Information Act, he will now release reports and
documents concerning similar unexplained incidents in the
United Kingdom;

(3) how many unexplained sightings or radar intercepts
have taken place since 1980.

Mr, Stanley: 1 have seen the memorandum of 13
January 1981 to which my hon. Friend refers. Since 1980
the Department has received 1,400 reports of sightings of
flying objects which the observers have been unable to
identify. There were no corresponding unexplained radar
contacts. Subject to normal security constraints, I am
ready to give: information about any such reported
sightings that are found to be a matter of concern from a
defence standpoint, but there have been none to date.
