the many hoavers was enough to prove
that. Take what happened in Jersey just
three months ago. £
Several people there saw an object in
the sky. It was-nothing very definite. . It
could have been a balloon, an aircraft
catching the sun or a mere freak of the
atmosphere. But it was peculiar. . And

it was also, according to a newspaper

report, suflicient to give Mr. Reginald
Queree of St. Helier, the idea of throw-
ing a mode! Flying Saucer into the air and
photographing it. The resulting picture
was: he is reported as saying, the strange
object which the others had scon.

But it was not until the picture had
been published in good faith by a national
newspaper, that this story was published.

**Large White Disc"

We could also laugh at the strange
goings on at Wardle, in Lancashire, Mere
the hoaxers appear to have been at work
again-but, this time. they operated. in
reverse, as it were.

It was the evening of February 15 this
year when Mrs. Dorothy Fitton, a 45-
year-ald civil servant, looked out from
her rather isolated cottage and saw a
strange object moving in from the south-

Flying quite slowly. it moved in a
dead straight tine.

As the object drew nearer, Mrs. Fitton
could sce that it was a light Mashing
alternately red and white. "Above the
light she could just make out in. the
darkness a large white disc-"as big as
a cartwheel." .

The object stopped, hovered stock-still
for some five minutes, and then moved
off, just as slowly and surely in'a dead
straight line towards the south-cast. This
was exactly ninely degrees from . its
original course. No noise at all.

Others in the village saw it. Mr. J. A.
Leavey, the local M.P., heard about it
and questioned those who had seen it.
He was impressed and decided to ask «
question in Parliament.
| When the question was asked it caused
quite a bit of hilarity in the House, . Mr.
Or-Ewing, Air Under Secretary, said
that the object did not emanate: from

 

 

 

space but from a laundry in Rochdale !

He, went on to explain that a man
working at. the laundry "had. contacted
the police and told them that, on the
might in question, he had released two
children's balloons filled with hydrogen.
Below, he had rigged up a system of
Mashing lights. | This, said the Under
Secretary, was what had been seen.

And so the matter was apparently
neatly tied up.

Or at least it was until a local news-
paper interviewed the man who claimed,
to have released the balloon and dis-
covered that he had no idea of how to
fill a batloon with hydrogen nor how to
fit lights to it. In fact, said the news-
paper, he had noth-
ing at all to do
with the UFO. He
had | not released
any balloons. This
supposition ' was
given added weight
when.. the . people
who had seen the
UFO insisted that
it was not a balloon
of any type.

Now, after off-
cially . debunking
this sighting, the
Air Ministry have

But, in spite of all this, I do not think
that we should laugh at UFOs, During

from aircraft to spots before the eyes.
Vet. wrapped up in all these have been

which are ofiem mistaken for Flying

The object was so near that it over-

seemed inevitable. Then, at the last

moment, the object swerved and fashed
