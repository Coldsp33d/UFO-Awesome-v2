 

group of Scandinavian scientists were
returning by air after observing an eclipse
of the sun from the polar regions. They
were on their way back, but still taking
photographs of the sun, when their atten-
tion was taken by something else. Several
shining disc-like objects appeared to be
shadowing their aircraft. What they were,
nome of the scientists knew. They were
no aircraft such as we know them and
none of the scientists on the trip had ever
seen anything like them.

And this year there have been a whole
spate of sighting reports. One private re-
searcher has collected 149 reports from
Great Britain for the months of April and
March alone. No doubt many of these
could be discounted if a thorough inves-
tigation were made. But others remain
a mystery.

Before any of these can be truly labelled
** unidentified," however, a ver thorough
investigation must be made. The would.
be investigator would have to know,
among other things. the movements of
all aircraft or balloons likely to have been
in the area at the time. He would have
to have a very sound knowledge of
weather phenomena and astronomy-and
of human nature.

But there are people willing to under-
take this task. To find out who they are
and how they go about the job, it is
necessary once more to dip briefly back
into saucer history.

In the carly vears soon after 1947.
"saucer" clubs began to spring up all
over the country: Their objects were not
always well defined but gencrally it was
to investigate saucer sightings.

Since this time there has been a
general movement towards amalgamation
and most clubs now regularly exchange
views with others in this country and
abroad. At the hub of all saucer activie
ties in this country is the magazine;
Flying Saucer Review.

 

Inside a Saucer

This is a small, well-produced Mags
zine which sells about 1,300 copies. " It
Allempts to cater for all degrees of saucer
fans and so it is not surprising to read
in a recent issue. an article by a " high
ranking Tibetan Lama" telling how he
went for a ride in a Flying |

But it would be quite wrang to dismiss
all readers and contributors of this maga-
zine as cranks. The editor is the Hon.
Brinley le Poer Trench and he is far
from the steel iden of a Flying
Saucer crank, Tall and amiable, Trench
is. by an odd cha

nce, a space salesman
by profession.

Trench admits that
he is working on a
"sticky wicket." He
realises that many of
his readers want to
Â«see. " astounding sau
cer news " but, at the
same time, he tries to
keep reports of actual
sightings as objective
as possible, .
Among. his readers
' are some who act as
investigators. . These
men Trench entrusts
with the task of looking into sightings.
Two such men are Jack Tson, a York-
shire business man, and Wilfred Daniels.
a technical writer from Stafford.
. These two, like most other of Trench's
investigators, are enthusiastic about their
task and_ believe 'implicitly in Flying
Saucers, They also believe that they have
an interplanetary origin. _ How far is this
theory justified ?. Let Trench explain :

"UFOs have been timed," he says.
"travelling at fantastic pods, far in
excess of anything earthmade. . And,
again, many UFOs have been seen per-
forming manoeuvres, such as a right
angled turn at high speed. which would
Cause any normal material or crew to
disintegrate under the excessive i loads,"

Prominent experts, such as Professor
Hermann Oberth. the guided missiles
expert, have also expressed these views.
Oberth_ says : "My own etplanation of
UFOs is as they are machines built in
some place other than on the Earth. 1
believe. that they originate exclusively
from outside the Earth because observa-
tions suggest that Flying Saucers are able
to suppress the force of gravity. and 1 do
not think that anyone on Earth has yet
found the means to do so.""

One Failing wi ppears to be general
among the most enthusiastic of saucer
fans, is lack of a critical approach to
their subject, Bear in mind the deceptive
nature of human observation and the
many atmospheric freaks that are pose
sible, and it is easier to see how
important it is to be critical. '
ypical report received by Trench is
that Shick came from Miss K. Connor.
a member of the Royal Observer Corps,
who lives at Truro, Cornwall. - Last
October, while on a ROC exercise, Miss
Connor and her crew saw a UFO.

" The object tta" as a small, silver
round one like a ball," said Miss Connor
in her report. | "Then it turned sideways
and was seen to be oblong. The side
away from the sun glowed pink and a
sort. of / translucent | blue." - Estimated
height was 45-50,000 fect. The UFO
appeared to be "standing still against
the wind " and ppeared when it rose
into the upper haze, -

although be is one of the many who
abhor this term for UFOs.

Gravity Theory

. In 1950 Thornton wrote a thesis en-
titled " The Unified Field Theory " which
dealt with many aspects of gravity which {
had never before been examined. This -,
had a great success and is still used in
many universities all over the world by
students in this field of research. It was
in 1950, too, that he first became inter- &
ested in UFOs. "Many aspects of this /
phenomenon," he says, "have a very
close bearing to my work on gravity."

His: first "delving. into /the: literature
written an the subject of UFOs was not
encouraging. - He still has no hesitation
in describing all of it as " science fiction."
He makes one exception. This is the
book " The Report on Unidentified Flying
Objects," by Edward Ruppelt, one-time
head of the USAF " Project Blue-Book "
investigation . into _ the mystery. . This
book is. indeed, one reliable volume
on the subject, It does not state that
UFOs are interplanetary, but it is the
most convincing book ever written to
prave that they exist.

Since 1950 Thornton - has - himself
reached the conclusion that UFOs exist.
He has done more. Helped by many
friends, some of them scientists like him-
self, he has been able to classify these
objects into fourteen different categories.
They range from small "saucers " only
ten inclies in diameter, to buge, cigar-
shaped objects up to a mile in length.
These never descend lower than the very
fringes of our atmosphere.

Dr. Thornton has also found out that
UFOs have a periodic frequency and that
sightings reach a peak every 21 years. It
was in early March that he told me that
we could expect a crop of sightings to-
wards the end of May. 'The recent spate
of reports has shown how right he was.

"There is nio positive evidence that
UFOs come from outer: space," says
Thornton. " but all the available evidence
scoms to indicate that they do not come
from this earth." :

If pressed, he will advance the theory
that UFOs may come from a solar system
other than our own. -" Our sun is a very
