SOMETHING IN THE SKY

common type of star." he explains, " and there are many others
like it in the Universe. It seems most likely that these stars will
also have planets. UFOs could come from these planets."

Gravity still remains Dr. Thornton's main interest and he
continues his researches. .He has told me that it should soon
be possible to build a device which would enable man to over-
come gravity without recourse to wings or jet lift, If he has
any suecess with this, then Dr. Thornton may be well on the
way to building a Flying Saucer of his own !

NS there no offcial inquiry into the Flying Saucer mystery 2
Two years ago the Air Ministry pronounced :

"About ninety per cent of the reports (of Flying Saucers)
have been found to relate to meteors, balloons, flares and many
other objects. The fact that the other ten per cent remain
unexplained may be attributed to nothing more sinister than
lack of date." And it has said very little else until May of
this year. | Then, Mr. George Ward, Secretary of State for Ait.
said, in answer to a question in the House, that there had been
so far this year five objects sighted which could not be
explained. This compared, he went on, with six in 1956, none
in 1955 and six in 1954,

The Air Ministry will not elaborate on this statement. . We
are left to presume that the unidentifieds this year include the
Wardle myster and the radar sighting from West Freugh.

But there are many people, other than the ardent saucer
fans, who would like to know the answer. People like ex-
Squadron Leader Ermest Booker of Lower Hillmorton Road,
Rugby, Just after 9 pm. on Tuesday, October 23, last year, Mr.
Booker, now a schoolmaster, saw a strange sight in the night sky.

" There were two lights," he said, " about twice the size of air-
craft navigation lights seen from 1,500 fost and a light amber in
colour. They were different from anything else I have ever
seen."" During the war Mr. Booker was a pilot-an instructor
at the Central lying School,

"The most mysterious thing about these lights was that they
made no noise whatsoever." he continued. " They wore moving
Tairly slowly set a light breeze from east to west, quite low,
about 1,500 feet up. As they moved the lights seemed. to
uscillate a litle, hoth lights moving together as if they were at
front and rear of some object which I couldn't see in the
darkness."

Many other people in the Rugby district saw them. The
ex-Squadron Leader was quite sure that they were neither
balloons mor gliders; neither an aircraft nor a searchlight
reflecting on a cloud. What they were he does not know, but
he would very much like to know.

And so the seucer mystery moves on." Perhaps by August.
1959, when according to Dr. Thornton's theory, another peak
period of sightings is due, we may know something more about
these things. Perhaps some major discovery may have been
made. - And then UFOs tight break into the biggest sensation
of the century,

But today there can be no doubt that UFOs remain, very
much, a mystery. @
