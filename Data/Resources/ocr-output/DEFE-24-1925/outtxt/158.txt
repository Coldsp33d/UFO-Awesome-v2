Dear Sire, 40] - [Section 40

 

 

 

 

 

 

} I have sent it to you ai ve carried an 'open remark' addressed
to the M.O.D concerning the Suffolk and other UFO landings

f which have been taking place in Englend.

| On page 21 is the part I would like you to read and if you

| would be so kind as to answer so thet I may publish your

| answer. It IS a valid question snd one that should be answered.

Please find enclosed a 'l publication CNK.

[ Incidently, I have NEYERvsent to you any UFO sightings, although
! I once had three forms printéd in triplicate on such, one was

[ intended fomnyour perusal. If in future you WOULD like me to

| send in anything I consider important, would that be in order?

If, as I read, the national security of England is ultimately

in your hands, and you would advise cer&#in aspects of- UFOLOGEY
should NOT be publiked, as England's defence means my sefety too,
then by all means let me kngw what NOT to print.

1} Meanwhile, as MY safety matters to me, and to us ALL, why is

[i it then that when we get these (landing cases' the M.O.D doesn't
1} investigate. Supsly that's what it should do? If you don't

look your doors at night..... if you see what I mean. (Somthing
might slide-in unnoticed) therefore I think it ought to BB investi
gated, and this promted me to write page 21 to you....

| I hope this letter has been constructive in bith aspects, and I
would like your reply to it. (for publication}.

Please note that as I forgot to send you this issue, it is an
odd copy I had, and not really up to the quality. You may keep it.

| R Yours sincerely,
