md it is also something to store something I hop

NK, for short, was incepted in JUNE 1972, and has had l
%e ups and downs like many others. CHK's troubles lie
wound tie method of production-namely duplicating. Our -
iachine is, at this issue nearly on its last gasp. It

ias been working faithfully since 1968 non-§top and has
aruned out much material. In the beginning, my good.
'riend and sub editor of long standing, David Prockter,
omplained that I shouls got up off from the
'loor, way back in the 1960's, trying to do}; 3-colour
wwplicated photos, and to RRECOGNISEABEE pictures.
