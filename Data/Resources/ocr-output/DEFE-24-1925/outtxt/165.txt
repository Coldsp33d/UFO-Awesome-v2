CONCLUSION AND
OUR POLICY ON UFOs

Cosmology - Newslink's policy on
unidentified flying objects is | based
on the statements and article seen

inv.stigations into them. - Our policy
is now as follows:

'We would like to '

believe that. UFOs
exist; so we hope to

find evidence, in some

form other than photographic
and present an overall Ficture

on them in general.

the long waik down an eadless road
in sheer frustration, but continue to
seek for answers until we can reach
the satisfactory conclusion that the
whole world has for centuries been
waiting for.

bright - to be seen from a
