far as my memory goes into it, Halley's comet

Lley's comet is on its way back. It should become vis-
Le to the naked eye in December. It will be a chance for
tubers to Absérve the comet, if they have not already
ae so. Unfortuneately observers in the Northern Hemis-
»me (like us) won't be "ble to got a brilliant view of
s comet due to unfavourable approach, which places the
a between us and the comet at Perihelion.
Jowever it will be visible to the naked eye low down in
a South by early 1986, 5a d. %
According to our expert behind our telescopes, Trevor °
a4, we should be able to.see down to magnitude +13, °
as or minus Waghitude depending on sky conditions,
erefore it will be around mid August that we may get our;
rst glance at the comet through one of our main. teles-
pes. Then over the next few months its position; can be
otted among the stare. and notes made of its gradual

The York Astronomical Society may even go outside the city of

York, to observe the comet from dark, unobserved areas to got. a

it in real life,what was it that Presi@oht Kennedy said?).

the months of its apparition. Even a short undriven exposure 1
will show 'the comet.
