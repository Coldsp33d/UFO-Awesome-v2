According to this information supplked by the YORK
Astronomical Society Halley's Comet is or was on the
co-odinates given above seen near ALDERBARAN . In. the
vicinity of 'the comet are star groups of ORION and RIGZL.

It is at the moment not clear from this map where the
comet is to appear next. Hopefully it is heading for ORION
so at any case, keep watwhing. -If anyone out there can send
us a plot chart showing where we should look for it, That
would be most helpful. Editor, Thanks to Martin Dawson .°
and for ALGCL, which contained the above information.

is this interesting bit on Halley's Comet by Roger

C. Moldander called: ONLY 14 MILLION YBARS UNTIL
DOCMSDAY, (Thanks Gene this came just in time for this
article): =note due to ' length, we have shortenéd it).
"Halley's Comet appeared in 1066, on the éve of the
Norman invasion of England. It cuts a striking figure

in a contemporary tapestry woven to celebrate the con-
quest; altogether more moving than our 1910 photogz

of its last visit. (article about comets in eneral

In fairly short order-we may find -say, in 14 million.
years time-we. may find ourselves similarly transfixed..
Not, mind you, by.Halley's comet. This "friendly" visitor
has 'been tracked since 240B0., we enlightened moderns have
ho reason to fear it. But scientists have recently made a
case for periodic cycles, ef perhaps a million years each,
in which a billion-odd comets flash through the solar sys-
tem, with odd of two dozen direct hits on.the Earth, throwing
enough dust into the upper atmosphore <to blook .out the sun
and this destroying life forms on the murface. Sounds fam-
iliar? Like the nuclear winter we could bring on ourselves.
But turn away from the doomeday olook now set by atomic
mclentists at four minutes to midnight. The Doomsday clook

has been set forward, from 5 billion years to 14 million,

not by any human malice or intent. The cause is uncertain,
