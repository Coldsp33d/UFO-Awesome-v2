phnning to feature the comet on television specials for
syndication,glthough they do not want their names disclosed
yet. The TV networks and print media are expected to devote
considerable time to the comet. This will mark the first
time that TV coverage will be possitb. Looking at all the
multi-media coverageas indirect public relations for its
project, one of the myndicators 'has developed & logo for its
program and has begun lining up licencees in the United
States and abroad. ((From Advertising 'Ago, Copyright 1984,

Hero's an interesting letter sent to CNK from Martin Dawson
of 'the Tork Astronomical Society in" 1982 concerning comets:

"Please find enclosed cuttings, expecially the one.sbout a:
possible collision with a comet. Bit frightening ch? It-may
turn out to be like Kohoutek and the alignment of. the plab-
ets where nothing happened, but who knows. | When are you ..
going to bring back CHK on to the market? I miss that old .
mag and still look at old copies. Col, ©
I will have to go now, ta-raa, yours, Martin Dawson. YAS.
*CNK looked at the ctbting at it was about.comet Swift- |
Tuttle, and a warning that 1% might collide with the earth.
Tet again it missed us by a million miles. The warning
was put out by Dr. Brian Marden, of the Smithdonian Astro-
nomical Observatory in Massachussets. He. calculated the oddd
at 1 in 2 million of a collision.. They are greater odds
than the annual chances of a disaster from random astronomi-
cal events, such as a collision with an asteroid or a nearby
stellar explosion. If Swift Tuttle had hit land the effect

would be far greater than the largest nuclear weapon. It

NOSTAGLIC NOTE: (Letter from Beryl Wallace, 16th June 1972.)
As we have shown what Issue 1 of CHK was like, I have come ao-
ross a letter from one of CKK first reporters, an expert in the
field of.MIB. (men in black) Beryl Wallace. She wrote; in 1972;

" Just a quick word to- say that.I enjoyed your first issue
of Cosmology Newslink, that new way of printing is really good,
it looks like the print in FSR,. The idea of sections is pretty
good and seems to: be working out fine. Tou will find enclosed
a 60p subscription plus some more MIB articles. It was a good
idea to dedicate the first issue to Rita, it gives a' good
youch to the magazine.

| Keep up the good mork, and give my regards to Rita. All the
best, Beryl. -
