ABOUT UFOS °

; The truth ip I can't find any branch of the subject to get

| enthusiastic over. Some points however then-one 'by one

{ together with my responses.

ils NEXT 25 TEARS OF UFOLOGTMy answer to this is fairly simple,

{ if not cynical,. BUFOR&@'s subscriptions are going up :ti.. they
| rise and wise, until they are down to 150 hard core members.
I Most- will be on so many differéit committees that they will bo
H too' busy ¥6 attend their own A.G.M. Lionel Beer will continue
jto sell his books as he has been doing. for: the last 25 years.
The FRINGE kbRMENTS will diversify even further-people will
forget the weason for Skywatches and will travel miles to
' Sradle Hill, Glastonbury, vor 'Stonchenge Littlebay caverns but
| will be-unable to tell you why UFO sightings are so commonplace
that -wiien one orashes into the Houses of Parliament and destroys
six square miles of high-rent London, it will be nine months
| before anyone notices, Some mut-cases will drop out, some NBT
NUT-CASES will join the ranks and some will go on like it was
still 1947. Naturally, Mike Parry will:still be selling'BIRIE
OF A MOVMMENT' and advertiseing 'SPACE-EK 1999"!
2. COSMOLOGY: future weather progpetts? That'll stay
much as i%.4s.now, cold, wet, and windy, even in mid August!
3. MOON ROCKS (brought back by Apollo missions to the moon),
§ Where are: they now?- most of them are still on the Moonysilly! !

4. Why dig: up somoth on LEY. LINSS? Honestly, why bother.
Let sleeping dogs lie. {or dead ones}. --
5. SUFFOLK UFO LANDING - Was it one? or not? How should I know?
I wasn't there 1 . A job for Sherlock Holmes!
6. SPACE REs@ARCH? All we see right now is the insane use of
Military Strategy outside our atmosphere,. Reality and science,
fiction are becoming transposed, and neither Luke Skywalker or
Carl Sagan' can tell ane from the other. Science is a good tool,
: but a bad master, The days of science as a boon to Mankind are
| over,if they ever existed beyond Pastuer or Fleming. Did Yon
| Braun know what he was doing? There are much worse things in
- the world, far more obscene than bare t..s!? Science scares me.

Tt cannot be trusted any more 'than our petty, squabbling 'lead-

ers'- LESS COMPUTERS, MORE ppg ames on. Less Micro-chips, more

 

Soin.
