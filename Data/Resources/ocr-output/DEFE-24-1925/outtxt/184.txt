I am writing to you,after writing two letters to R.A.F. St
in Cornwall. These letters were sent to the Air Base during
May and July,this year.

The subject of this correspondance dealt with brief details of a
reported UFO sighting, that was observed very close to this Air Forte Base
eariler this year.

Their geplies to me,and my then Organisation, Plymouth UFO
Investigation Centre (PUFOIC),they told me that they had forvarded both
my. letters onto "the M.0.D. im London" , which I presume is yourself.
They apparently decided to do this,after taking advice from Headquarters
of Provost and Security Services (U.K.). They stated that I would hear
from you,however as to date I have not done so,

Because of the length of time taken from first contacting the
Area Military Authorities,and the apparent lack of progress,I have
decided to write to ask whether your department has infact,received my
previous two letters to R.A.F. St Mawgan? (The Ref ..PUFOIG 38/85).

If this 'reported UFO Sighting' had not been observed so close to
a strategic Military Air Base,I would have waited for another fow weeks,
before writing to you.However,this is a sighting which was observed less
than ome mile ( 1.6095») away from the Air Base. From directions given
to us from the witness, we calculate that whatever this phenomenon was,
it might very well have passed through the Air Force Base itself,

In ouriearly stages of our investigations into this case,we thought
that this phenomenon might have landed,0r hit the ground and nearby trees
in an area close to the base,but we found out two possible causes for
the burned areas of grams and trees, and have now dismissed the 'landing'
theory from our enquiries, But,we do know the phenomenon came very close
to the ground,and minoy roads because of what the witmess stated,and we
have discovered a tree,close to the sighting area and fire damaged trees
and ground wilich has obviously been hit by an airborne object of some
mass,hitting 'the tree at some speed.We know this from damaged major
twige of the tree which have been examined,

-I do mot beleive in wasting postage money in sending reports to
you sbout mere 'Lights in the sky,ete',but this sighting proves to vhe
very different from most of the reports we receive, The tree which was
*hit" was only 20ft (6.098) tall,and was hit at a height of I5f% (4.579),
