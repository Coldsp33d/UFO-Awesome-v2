There is a possibility that it hit the tree,prior to being seen.It also
i nearly hit the car the witness was travelling in,and could have caused an
accident! The phenomenon bobbed and weaved about the road, sbove the .
hedgerow to the tarmac on the road.

I am gure you will agree to my concern over this sighting,which was
obviously not an aireraft, I also doubt the possibility of a stray missile
although after the fiasco at the American Air Force Base in Suffolk a few
years ago,this explanation is always a possibility!

I hope that you will be able to deal with this letter soon, taking into
consideration the time I have waited since May, Because of my research
into *W.F.0's' I belong to BUFORA,who you will be aware of. They,some
local people and a Fleet Street journalist are becoming concerned at the
lack of progress and identification of this phenomenon, My own concern is
the danger to the local people and housing ete,if a similar phenomenon were
to collide with a habitable building,or even a car,. -

There are some similarities between this case,and the one at USAF
Woodbridge, Suffolk. Information gained by Investigators was confused by
the American way of dealing with 'Public Relations',but I would hope that
this is not the case with this sighting.
