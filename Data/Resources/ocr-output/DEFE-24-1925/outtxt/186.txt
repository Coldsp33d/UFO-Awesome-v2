Further to my letter of 24 July, I am now writing to enquire if there is any
possibility of the Ministry releasing to me a sketch of an unidentified object

which was made by PC P at Stanmore, Middlesex, on the night of
26 April 1984.

I understand from Scotland Yard Press Bureau that a full report of the incident
(which involved at least half a dozen police officers and four witnesses) was
sent to the MoD and Civil Aviation Authority. e the Police Area
Press Officer (Harrow) told me that the sketch would not be released, and that
this was more properly a matter for the MoD.

In view of the Ministry's oft-repeated statement that no defence significance
has been found to date, I am puzzled why a drawing of a flying saucer should
remain classified, especially since the officer concerned has given a detailed
description to the newspapers.

With best wishes

Yours sincerely
