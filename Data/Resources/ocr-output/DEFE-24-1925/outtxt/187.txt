Thank you for your letter of 6 January 1985, I am sorry that I
have been unable to reply before now.

With regard to the concern you express about the book "Sky
Crash", the only information we have on the alleged "UFO sighting" at
Rendlesham Forest in December 1980 is the report by Colonel Charles
Halt, of the United States Air Force. We are satisfied that the
events described are of no defence significance. I can assure you
that there is no question of attempting to cover up any incident or
mishap, nor are we attempting in any way to obscure the truth.

Under the rules laid down by the Public Records Acts, files
must remain closed until 30 years have elapsed since the last action
taken on them. The earliest UFO files of which we have records are
dated 1962. However, any files which do remain from 1954, or
earlier, may be obtained direct from the Public Records Office at
Ruskin Avermue;- Kew, Richmond, Surrey TW9 LDU.
