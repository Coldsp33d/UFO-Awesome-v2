Thank you for your. letter of 3 June 1985. I am sorry that I
have been unable to reply before now,. You may find it useful if I |
explain that the sole interest of the United Kingdom Ministry of
Defence in reported sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)
is to establish whetties they have any bearing. & on the defence of the
eountry, c < 00 - < > ces ke m-

There is no organisation in the Ministry of Defence appointed
solely for the purpose of studying reports of such objects, and no
staff are employed on the subject full time. The reports we receive
are referred to the staff in the Department who are responsible for
the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports
as part of their normal duties.

Since our interest in UFOs is limited to possible defence
implications we have not carried out a study into the scientific
significance of these phenomena. Unless there are defence
implications we do not attempt to identify sightings and we cannot
inform observers of the probable identity of the object seen. The
Department could not justify the expenditure of public funds on
investigations which go beyond the pure defence interests.

We have to recognise that there are many strange things to be
seen in the sky, but we believe there are adequate explanations for
them. They may be satellite debris re-entering the earth atmosphere,
ball lightning, unusual cloud formations, meteorological balloons,
aircraft lights, aircraft at unusual angles or many other things.

Whilst I appreciate your concern about the possibility of an
aircraft colliding with a UFO, I can assure you that RAF pilots and
crews are well aware of the dangers of collision with any identified
object including such things as hang-gliders and even birds.
Procedures are therefore designed to protect aircraft, as far as
possible, from this kind -of risk. I am sure similar standards are
applied by the CAA in respect of civil aircraft.
