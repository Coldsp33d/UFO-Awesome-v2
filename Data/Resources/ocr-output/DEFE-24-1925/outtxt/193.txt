MEETING BETWEEN US of S(AF) AND LORD HILL-NORTON

UFOs

 

a. I accept that there are strange phenomena to be seen in the |
sky, however I believe there to be adequate explanations for them.
Experience has shown that most reported sightings can be attributed
to things such as aircraft, meteorological balloons or natural
phenomena like ball lightning. Of sourse there are many other
equally straightforward explanations. However, there are a small
number of cases where a simple explanation cannot "aJ io. y mp4 Mas
immediately and on these cccasions we are careful to ensuref that they
are of no Defence significance. Having satisfied ourselves of this,
as you know, we do not attempt any further investigations. Clearly
some reports remain unexplained but we have found no evidence that

these phenomena represent a threat to national security and therefore

cannot justify devoting Defence resources to their investigation.

b. All reports received by the MOD are channelled through
Sec(AS)2. They are passed to the Air Staff who examine them for Air
Defence implications. In some cases, where (on the face of it) there
could be a defence interest, enquiries are made of relevant radar
establishments ete in order to obtain more information. All reports
are also passed to the Defence Intelligence organisation who have a
keen interest in any sightings of unusual objects. We have no
specialist group in Whitehall or anywhere else involved in UFO's and

no civilian advisers fare involved.
