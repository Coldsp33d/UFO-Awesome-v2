The Flying Complaints Flight at Rudloe Manor are concerned
with receiving and investigating flying.complaints. In the course of
their duties they occasionally receive UFO reports (as do many other

units) but they have no specific role with regard to this subject.

Secretariat (Air Staff) is the Division which provides
secretariat support to CAS and the Air Staff and in this capacity is
responsible for correspondence with members of the public and
answering PQs ete on many subjects, including UFO's. Sec(AS)2 is the
branch which amongst other things handles UFO's, there is no such
branch as Air Staff Secretariat 8. You may be thinking of Defence
Secretariat 8 which no longer exists and from which Sec(AS) evolved

as a result of reorganisation. of MOD last January.

c. Many of the UFO reports received in MOD come through Defence
establishments, although most of these come originally from members
of the public.. Very few reports are made by military pilots; for

instance, in the last 12 months See(AS) has received only one such

report.
a. [GE3 to provide advice please]
e. The Department is happy to release what information we have on

specific incidents. However we could not justify the effort involved

in searching for or collating information of a more general nature.
