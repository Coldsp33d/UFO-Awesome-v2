Thank you for your letter of 18 July
1985. During 1984 we received a total of 211
reports of unidentified flying objects from
various sources. I attach a copy of Colonel
Holt's report dated 13 January 1981, as
requested. I also enclose a Hansard extract of
23 October 1983 which mentions the alleged
incident, I assume this is the answer to which

you refer in your letter.
