UFOs - RECORDS HELD BY PRO _- ENQUIRY FROM MR R NOYES

1. I attach a copy of a letter I have received from a Mr Ralph
Noyes concerning UFO's. I also enclose a copy of my reply. Mr Noyes
is an ex Head of DS8 and retired from the MOD as an AUS in the late
seventies, he is a regular correspondent on UFO matters and, because
of his background, is quite influential in "UFO" eircles.

2% As you will see, he raises two points on which I should be
grateful for your advice. The first concerns 2 reports which he
claims to have obtained from the Public Records Office. In view of
our often repeated assertion that our records only go back to 1962 (a
line which I believe you have confirmed in the past) this could
clearly become slightly embarrassing. I therefore feel that we
should try to identify exactly what files PRO still hold on the
subject and perhaps you could suggest the best way of doing this. In
the meantime I propose to take the same line with other corres-
pondents as I have in the attached.

3. Mr Noyes!' second point is a request for information relating,
I assume, to events in 1956. If he was shown photographs in 1970 as
he claims it may be that these files have also been retained. I have
told him that we would need further information in order to identify
these incidents but I am sure that more details will be forthcoming.
However, if you are able to shed any light on the "clips", or indeed,
the incidents themselves at this stage, I would be most interested to
know.
