221 July 1985

 

Your letter of 11 June addressed to Lord Trefgarne has been
passed to me for reply. I have also seen your letters of 3 December

1984, 8 March and 4 April 1985, but I regret there is little I can
usefully add to the reply sent you on' 28 November last
year.

While we are happy to try to provide copies of reports of
recent incidents in response to specific requests, the Department
could not justify the effort and expense involved in detailed
research into individual inquiries on UFOs. Moreover, as you already
know, the MOD's records on UFO matters only go back to 1962 and there
is therefore no further assistance we can give you on matters
relating to reports received before then.

It is possible, however, that some earlier papers have been
retained by the Public Records Office and you may wish to consider
pursuing your investigation there.

Yours sincerely
