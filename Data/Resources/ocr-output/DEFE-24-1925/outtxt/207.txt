UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

With apologies for ruining your summer I attach a letter that

Lord Trefgarne has received from Admiral of the Fleet Lord Hill-Norton
in reply to Lord Trefgarne's letter of 17 July. You will see

that Lord Hill-Norton accepts the offer of a meeting and we will

be in touch with him shortly to arrange this. I will let you know

the time and place as soon as possible, and in the meantime I

should be most grateful if you could set in hand a" briefing for Lord
Trefgarne in the form of answers to Lord Hill-Norton's specific
questions a-e.
