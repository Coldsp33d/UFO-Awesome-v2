26th July, 1985

The Lord Trefgarne,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State
for the Armed Forces,

House of Lords,

London, SW1.

hao Bavek,

Thank you for your letter of 17th July about our corres-
pondence on the UFD question. I would greatly welcome an off-the-
record talk with you, Parliament rises on Tuesday, but I would be
delighted to come up to London at any mutuslly convenient date
during August when you have had time to consider this letter and to
take any further briefing from officials which you think might be
useful. (Perhaps your office would care to be in touch with me by
telephone at my home address Tel:

It may be helpful if I list the questions which I, at any
rete, would like to explore. I know you will understand that I do
not ask them frivolously or without a good deal of careful thought
about the evidence - or supposed evidence - which appears to exist
for a persistent phenomenon which, as 1 see it at present, cannot
be wholly without Defence significance, 1 need hardly add that if
there were sensi a Defence questions at issue, I would be the last
to press them in public.

 

 

The ground which I hope we might cover in an informal <
discussion is indicated by the following questions:

a. Does the Ministry of Defence acknowledge - by way of reports
from the public, the civil police, the Civil Aviation
Authority, other civil authorities or its own establish-
ments - that traces are obtained from time to time of the
intrusion into British airspace (and sometimes territory)
of phenomena for which no prosaic explanation can be given?
{I should add that although I am always willing to be dis-
uaded, the evidence accumulated by civilian researchers for
the persistence of some such phenomena ~ amounting on
occasion to apparently structured 'vehicles' - seems to me
at present overwhelming. I shall be glad to give you
instances, The events reported by Lt. Col, Halt of the
United States Air Force in a report to your Department
dated 13th January 1981 are among them).
