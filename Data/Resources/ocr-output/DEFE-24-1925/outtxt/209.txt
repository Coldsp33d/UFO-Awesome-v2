b. Assuming, as I hope, that the Ministry of Defence does not
ignore the reports reaching it (and we have been told in
reply to Parlismentary questions that they amount to some
hundreds a year from civilian sources alone)}, what steps

there is overwhelming evidence for a persistent phenomenon of a
highly unusual character, This is, at the least, of considerable
scientific interest; and I have not yet heard anything from your
Department which convinces me that it is wholly without Defence
significance. I would be reassured to know either that it is being

adequately gripped as a Defence matter {and, if so, by precisely
what means) or that meterial held by your Department can be release
