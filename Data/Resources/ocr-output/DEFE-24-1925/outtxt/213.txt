Director Of Research,

Research Organization,

 

Thank you for your letter of the 8th July.

 
 

Your deductions are correct,

and there were no corresponding stationary returns on our radar.
We would not expect any, of course, since our radar eliminates stationary

We do see a great deal of traffic that we have nothing to do with; not
CH ince the radar covers quare miles.
