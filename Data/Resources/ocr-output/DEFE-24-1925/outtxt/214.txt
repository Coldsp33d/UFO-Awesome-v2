11 July 1985 &

SUBJECT: UNEXPLAINED MAY 1985 No. of Sheets: One (1)

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above named subject;

After reading with some interest the Exeter Express newspaper report and
confirmation of the lights by several independent sources, this is a direct
request for information, pertaining to this incident,

1) It would appear the light source was of extreme size in relation to
ground observation,. This being the case, how does Civil and Military
advanced radar, receive no indication of the subject image?

. 2) In-flight refueling does take place in this vicinity, yet the local
R.A.F. base, claims no knowledge of such an operation, Does this
imply, a genuine unknown target was in the locality?

3) Does R.A.F. Chivenor agree that this multi-witness sighting of an
unknown, portray, unusual airborne light configurations? and what
in the opinion of Chivenor, do you feel the lights were representative

of?

The strange concealment of information surrounding this case, has worried many
civilians, and I do not think for one moment, both Exeter Airport and your
base failed to track the unknown,. Exeter Airport claim this is a matter for
the Police and Military, if this is the case, such a large sized structure

should have been recognised. +

Thank you for your valuable time, the information supplied will be used for
research purposes only, If Chivenor submitted a report to SEC (AS) 2, we would
be grateful for your signal (copy). Look forward to your reply.
