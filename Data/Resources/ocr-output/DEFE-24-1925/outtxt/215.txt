om -

Thank you very much for your helpful letter of 10 July 1985 in reply to mine
of 18 May 1985.

 

 

I am grateful to you for having gone to the trouble of providing me with a

list of sightings reported from all sources for the period 1978-1984, but note
that my question remains unanswered. While I realise that my request for the
number of military sightings from 1959-1984 was a tall order, I still need to
have some idea of the number of these - particularly concerning the RAF - in

a given period. May I therefore.re-phrase my question as follows: How many
reports of UFOs have been made by RAF personnel from 1965-1975? If that's too
time-consuming, may I ask: How many reports of UFOs were made by RAF pilots in
1967?

 

As you point out, there has been no evidence to date. to indicate a defence threat
or significance, so would your department have any objection to releasing details
in order to assist me in my researches? As already mentioned, I have obtained a
few reports from the early: Fifties which have obviously been declassified under
the 30-year rule, but it is well known that pilots.in the RAF have been seeing
these things since then: certainly the Bentwaters case (1956)is a good example.

I am glad to note that AS-2 is now the point to which all reports of UFOs are
sent. | But what about AS-8, which was mentioned to me by a reliable source? What
are its functions, please?

Finally, I was interested to note that your department recognizes that there are
"phenomena", even if you think there is: no defence significance to them, and that
no scientific study has been carried out.

If possible, I would appreciate a reply within four weeks. Thank you.

With best wishes

Yours sincerely
