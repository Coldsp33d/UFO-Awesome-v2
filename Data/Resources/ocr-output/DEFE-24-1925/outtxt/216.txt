Dear Mr Noyes »

Thank you for your letter of 31 May 1985, I am sorry that I
have been unable to reply before now. I was interested to learn that
you have obtained from the Public Relations Office copies of reports
written in the early fifties. I can only assume that they are from
Air Ministry files; if so that may be the reason we have no record
of their retention. I am grateful to you for drawing my attention to
them, and I shall be asking Air Historical Branch to do some
"digging" in case we receive other enquiries about them. I will also
consult AHB about the gun-camera 'clips' which you mention but
without further details, I am afraid it may be difficult to determine

~-~~-if-we-still have -the information: you ask for .- wows

You also requested a copy of the proforma on which we record
UFO reports and one is enclosed. As a general rule we are prepared
to release reports in this format in answer to requests for
information on specific incidents (although we do edit them slightly
so that, for obvious reasons, personal details of the informant are
not included). However we clearly cannot devote undue time and
effort to locating particular reports, nor are we able to issue them
in bulk.

On the subject of reports, I must thank you for the one you
submitted on 25 May and for your letter to RAF Rudloe Manor of 28
May. Your information has been passed in the usual way to those
responsible within the department.

Yours sincerely
