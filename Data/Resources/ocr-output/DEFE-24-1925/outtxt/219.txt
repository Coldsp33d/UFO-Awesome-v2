Our merest 1"

10 July 1985

 

 

- UR

Thank you for your letter of 4 June 1985, addressed to the
Prime Minister, which has been passed to me for reply. I have also
received your earlier letter to Sec(AS)2. Since the letters cover
essentially the same subject, I will reply to them both here.

As you say in your letter to the Prime Minister, you are
familiar with official policy on UFO matters. I can confirm that
there have been no changes to this policy as a result of transfer of
responsibility from DSB to Sec(AS)2 and that the sole interest of the
MOD is to establish whether reports have any bearing on the defence
of the country. I should immediately point out that Sec(AS) is the
only branch within MOD which is responsible for receiving reports of
UFO's from both military and civilian sources (including the Police
and CAA). The reports we receive are referred to those in the
Department responsible for air defence of the UK in order to
establish whether they hold any defence significance. As you
mention, there has been no evidence to date which would suggest a
defence interest. For this reason, and in view of our limited
interest, we have not carried out a study into the scientific
significance of these phenomena. I can assure you that there is no
question of "Top Secret research" being carried out.

With regard to your request for information on the number of
reports received since 1959, I'm afraid we could not justify the time
and effort involved in obtaining these figures for the years before
1978. However I attach figures which show the total number of
reports received from all sources for each year from 1978 to 1984.

You also mention in your letter of 18 May the fact that you
have obtained a number of Air Ministry reports from the Public
Records Office. I am sure you will appreciate that I cannot go into
the detailed arrangements for the disposal of our files. Never-
theless given the length of time since these documents must have been
passed to the Air Ministry's archives (I assume before 1955), it is
quite possible that some may have been retained prior to the setting
up of the Ministry of Defence, even though we have no record of this.
