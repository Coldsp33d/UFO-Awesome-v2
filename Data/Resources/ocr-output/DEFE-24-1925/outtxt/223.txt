"D/See (QS " o |
23 June 1985

Date

 

 

Thank you for letting us see the enclosed photograph which you
took in. November 1984." I must apologise that I have been unable to
return the picture before now.

You may find 'it useful if I explain that the sole interest of
the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence in reported sightings of
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) is to establish whether they have
any bearing on the defence of the country.

There is.no organisation in the Ministry of Defence appointed
solely for the purpose of studying reports of such objects, and no
staff are employed on the subject full time. The reports we receive
are referred to the staff in the Department who are- responsible for
the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports
as part of their normal duties.

Since our interest in UFOs is limited to possible defence
implications we have not carried out a study into the scientific
significance of these phenomena. Unless there are defence
implications werdo not attempt to identify sightings and we cannot

I inform observers of the probable identity of the object seen. The
t Department could not justify the expenditure of public funds on
investigations which go beyond the pure defence interests.

However I have consulted one or two people here in an attempt
to identify the object which appears in your picture. I am afraid my
enquiries have met with little success. Although we are convinced
that this is not, in fact, a tangible object, I can offer no explana-
tion as to what caused it to appear in the negative.

Yours sincerely
