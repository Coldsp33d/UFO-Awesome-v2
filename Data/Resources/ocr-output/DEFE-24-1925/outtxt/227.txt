Dear tz,

in relation to a specific.request by a who is a research
menber of" the- above named TFO organisa OR, .

within this Lotter, you atate specific engriries will be desi with by. the
fsirly new dept named See (A8) =2. This is your department, Unfortunately, I
~have to complain, that this said office does hot even reply to genuine research
enguiries-made by civilian UFO groups. I can mame, date and submit to you
~. 'persomally, at least six such requests for data which Rave mot even aquired
coum athiewledgenent, this I feel is a disgrace. .

"This éveniisatios once again requests that all letters forwarded. to your dept,
dating back to December 1984 .(form'y DSG) should.be looked into, We feel the
UFO phenomenon is a serious problem - which at times does afford a defence interest
'and as such the public Bess a right to view for themselves such decuments.

The United States, France .Y, Spain and even Australia offer a fuch
botter service to scientific establishments like ourselves. The. sooner: all UFO
documentation is released the better.

T look Torward to your reply.
