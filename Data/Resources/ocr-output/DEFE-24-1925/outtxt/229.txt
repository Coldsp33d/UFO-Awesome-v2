Dear Flight Lieutenant, ip) -

° Thank yeu fer yeur letter to PUFOIC;ef 23 Hay 1985.
As you will netice,I have since moved toe Cheshire earlier this menth,
from my previous residence in Flymeuth,Deven. I bepe that yeu will
netate my new address.

- Although I have meved seme 27O0miles Nerthf,1 am still in
charge of the investigation inte the,as yet, Unidentified Flying Object
which was observed very clese to your Air Force Base,during nexiy
February this year.

I fully appreciate your attention to my cerzespendance,
although as yet,I have net had any cerrespendance frem the Ministry
ef Defence, I presume that this was to their department in Lenden,
If they bave.replied to my previous Plymouth address,I have left
firm instructions to forward any mail on to mehere in Winsford,

Since my last letter to you,we have discovered ether lecal
pesple in the St Mawgan vicinity whe probably ebserved this same
phenemenen as the eriginal witness,and neturaliy they are a little
concerned from a safety angle.

I would be most grateful if the Ministry of Defence would
either provide an explanation fer this incident,er admit that there
are,as yet,ne explanations as to what several people observed.
Unfertunately,the lenger their reply takes,UFO Asseciations,and the
general public grow in suspicion that a mere sinister aspect was
the explanation. could accelerate their reply to us..
