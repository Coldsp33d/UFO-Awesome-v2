surface of small "bubbles" that support the body.
Like most other things in the craft it is grey in colour.
The table is supported on an hemispherical pivoting
support. On the lefthand side nearest the examiner is
some kind of long control box from which the
"pencil" instruments are obtained.

Whilst on the table John cannot move any part of
his body. (He believes that they did use other in-
struments on him but he cannot describe them.)

After the "bar" or "scan" stops at the end of the
table, John asks the tall entities if he can get up.
They answer: "Sit there for a while." John is suf-
prised when he realises that they did not speak, for
he had received a mental impression that they said
what they said. Whereupon he sits up and swings his
legs over the side of the table, His legs feel weak and
his whole body feels very loose. To his amazement he
is wearing a one piece garment similar to that of the
tall entities, This feels like his skin. The "examiners"
now disappear from the room.

Sitting up, John is able to get a better view of the
three tall entities and the room itself. This is about

visible noses or mouths, and John has a strong feeling
that the entities are wearing masks,

As far as John can recall there are 8 fingers on
each. hand, The skin is very pale, almost translucent.

Neither entity seems to have joints in arms or legs.
John likens this to a "bendy toy" or "blow up doll."
As they move their arms, no elbows can be seen.
Their movement is graceful, and they do not take
large strides when they walk.

When John has swung his legs over the side of the
table, he starts asking questions, all of which are
answered. At one point he asks: "What do you do
when you're outside the ship?"

"We use a visor," came the reply.

Looking around John sees one of the three entities
holding a "visor." It is hemispherical, with two head
bands, one going horizontally round the head, and
the other going across the head. Jobn compares it
with a welder's visor. Deep rusty red in colour it
would cover a normal-sized face.

The tallest entity, whom John presumes is the
leader, is the only one with whom he has direct
