UFO RBALT/Fenny Handles. (1983) 248 pages, 'index,

Clerkenwell Green, London, ECR OHT. This issths fifth book from the %
prolific hand of Ms Randles, it is sub-titled,. "A critical look at the -
physical evidence." One might argue that this is a anne for .
if there was 'physical evidence', sirely there would-be no UFOsi? The
book consists of some 1k chapters written in-her usual style, which
always makes for casy reading.. She adopts what she terms 'the JR set's
1051 UFO cases covering five years, which She has personally evaluated.
as her hard-date for evidence. This is a great weakness of the book, s -
she has not personslly investigated the casess Just because a case
has been investigated.up to levels 'A' or 'B', should not give it a
higher. status. How competent were the investigators involved is. just +
one reservation that should always be teken into account.- More and
more, Ks Randles, instead of. giving the true facts-about the UFO subject,
prefers to mould the opfmions of her readers. UFO Reality fails to
balance the open-minded viewpoint with that of. the skeptics. This is

~~ ~evident in the lack of references to Klass and Sheaffer (they are
only mentioned 3 times in the 'book) and in the section "further reading',
not one of their books is recommended? Hardly a critical look at the
evidence. tos

 

Throughout the book I thought many cases we omitted that she carld have

used for critical stuiy. For example, in Chapter 13 when discussing ..
photographic evidence, discussion is to be foun! on the Trinidade Island

primts, but there is no mention'of tie Jersey cases from 1973 which

showed an Adenticel object with what looks like a vapour trail - Kodak:

felt that the 'object' was caused by processing Avregularitios.

Another good case which was omitted, was the Wistaston, Cheshire hoax

photos from 1978. Here is an example of an English case being evalue ted °
by Ground Saucer Watch fir the states and uncovered as a hoax. In the tec
chapter on UFO movies, no'méntion is mede of the 1976) Ben- Boyd case j
from Australia, One could go-on; but in fairness Me iRabdles may be . 3
totally unsware of these cases. © 4

 
  

 

One final point, on page 152, 'she states the following, "I was told by x
a former British Covernment official once.that he. understood that such
a device (a crashed UFO - Ma. ) could be found in this country. It was
allegedly under wraps at-a military base somewhere. in South Wales." -
She says she treats such unsubstantiated stories as nothing more than
interesting, and though provocative they tend to be, unproveable. One
could ask who was the - official? Which Base? If some cases tend to be
unproveable, does that ean thatisome have been proved?. I won't go

on but it is annoying that in too many UFO books, canrots are ritually
dangled before the reader without any factual proof. Tas d too
tempting for Ms Randles to include this 'rumour'? It would appear so.
Many books on the subject claim to be critical, many are not and this
title, whilst appearing on the surface to acheive the. joby meny a
