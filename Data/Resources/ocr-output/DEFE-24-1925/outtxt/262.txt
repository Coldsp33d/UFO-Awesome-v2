Dear Prime Minister ,

I am sorry to burden: you with a question on an apparently trivial and irrelevant
subject at a time when you have far more pressing problems to deal with. I refer '
to the much-ridiculed and controversial subject of Unidentified Flying Objects,
which must have been brought to your attention on a number of occasions.

As you are doubtless aware, the subject is treated with the utmost seriousness by

a number of intelligence agencies in the United States, notably the Central
Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency. (With regard to the latter, a
Supreme Court ruling in 1982 decreed that the NSA was fully justified in withholding
139 documents on UFOs, in the interest of national security. This has been confirmed
for me in a letter from Mr James Devine, Director of Policy for the NSA. The latter
has, however, released to me some. declassified documents under provision of the
Freedom of Information Act which leave little room for doubt that the subject of
UFOs is in some instances classified above Top Secret.

I am familiar with the policy of Her Majesty's Government and have corresponded for
many years with the Ministry of Defence on these matters, yet have been unable to
secure official confirmation that any serious scientific research is being conducted,

x other than that reports are treated seriously but not pursued unless there is a
defence interest. Apparently there is no evidence thus far that UFOs have any
defence significance.

Unofficially it has been confirmed that Top Secret research is being conducted in
this country, and I have been informed by reliable sources that in 1978 alone the»
budget was I am given to understand that there is close collaboration
with U.S. intelligence on the matter. My question then is: Are you aware of this
secret research into UFOs? Former Prime Ministers Lord Wilson and Mr Heath have
told me that they cannot comment on the subject as they do not know anything about
it. I feel sure that you can come up with something better than that! As titular
head of the security and secret services, presiding over meetings with the JIC, for
example, 'there must have been an occasion when you were informed about this secret
research, 'as well as national security implications. If not, I am left with the
suspicion that the subject is so sensitive that not even the Prime Minister is on
a 'need to know' basis.

Finally,a word of encouragement for your fine leadership. I have nothing but
admiration for the courage and tenacity with which you pursue the problems facing
our country.

With best wishes, I remain,
Yours respectfully,
