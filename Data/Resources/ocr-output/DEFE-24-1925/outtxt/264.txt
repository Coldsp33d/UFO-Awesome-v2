Dear Sir (or Madam),

I am the Chaixman of the above Secicty,and also the Regional Investigations
Officer, (South = west) for the British V.F.0. Research Asseciation (5.5.F.0.R.4.).

My reason for writing to you,is to request an sppointwent,in the near future,
at. your convenience of course, The subject for discussion i% an alleged U.F.0,
sighting (and landing), very close to your Base,that ecouled in Febraary this year,

We have good reason to beleive that the sighting was genuine,and that the
witness did net fabricate a hypethetical event. Members of our Seciety have visited
and interviewed the wituess for over two hours, h

Although at prosent we are classifying this incident as a 'U.F.0.' incident, we
have net dismissed the possibility that what the witness chserved,could have been
a form of experimental aerial craft - possibly from your Base. That is,of course
if you are invelved with design and testing of experimental aircraft. Should this
be the true identity of this 'U.F.0.* sighting,then a greater measure of safety is
certainly required,as this object nearly collided with a meving vehicle!

Should this sighting be truly unexplained,and you were not responsible for it,
then I wender,if you were able to track it on the radar facilities used at

R. A.F,. St Mavgan? R

We have calculated that the object in question, might have passed through your
Base,and furthermore ~ we beloive that it lsnded less than one mile sway,burning
seil,grass and some small trees. We also beleive that when it departed after landing,

'1t hit a twee as it ascended.

Because there was an increase in radiation levels on trees and groumd,after the
U.F.0. incident at R.A.F. Bentwaters/wecdbridge,in Suffelk in December 1990,we are
planning to examine the readings of radioactivity at the place of impact of this case,

Although ¥,F.0. Investigaters experienced a 'mass of denial' over the ¥.F.0.
hypothesis at R.A.F. Rentwaters/Woedbridge - by both M.0.D. and U.S.4.F. Officials
and even D 3 8 at M.0.D. Offices in Lenden,i truly hope this will not be the case
by Officials from a British Air Force Establisiment,

I leok fervard to hearing from you,in the not too distant future,

+9.
