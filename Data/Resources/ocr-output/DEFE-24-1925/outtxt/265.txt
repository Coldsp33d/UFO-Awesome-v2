Dear Community Relations Officer,

I am the Chairman of the above Seciety,and alse the Regional Investigations
Officer - South- West, for the British U.F.0. Research Association, (B.4.7.0.R.4.).

This is my second letter to you - during a telephone cenversation,te your
Eetablishnent today, they were not aware of my previous ene,therefere,l am writing you
another,

I am writing to request an appeintment with you,hopefully in the near future
to talk about a V.F.0. sighting that eccurred early February, The: sighting vas
extremely close to the perimeter of your Base and we beleive that the object might
have 'landed' on the ground, for some time, Our belief here,lies with evidence of a
*landing! in the discovery of an ares of damaged and burned grass,seil and trees,

and alse another tree that has been hit at the top ng several large branch '
off it,It is this, that I feel more relevant, »snappi ge es

Ghvieusly we have not dismissed the pessibility,that whatever chused this
damage,and more inpertantly,what our witness observed,was infact seme form of aircraft
being tested from RAF St Mavgen, However I must add,that,when airborne,the craft was
only 8 -I5ft above the ground!

Should you be unable to account for this sighting, then did you manage to
recerd it on your radar system,at the Base? Our own calculations indicate the object
could have passed ever the Base.

Since my last letter to you,we have taken radicactivity readings at the areas
of damage,stated above,and I am happy to report there were no abnormalities detected,
However, following the hypothetical theories put forward,which were neither denied,mer
confirmed by the M.0.D. ;at RAP Woodbridge in Suffelk,after their strange incident in
Deceun 1980,our own theories must be similar to those in Suffelk,which were:-

() ypg .- cashed serial craft Cbxperimental craft, ex hissile going astray. I state those
simply because the description of the Woedbridge incident,and the one close to your
Bese,were nearly identical both in description and in si%@pand also aerial capability,

We thought that the best way to begin our task of selving this sighting,is to
ask your advice,prier to approaching 3.9.0, im Londen. s

we look forward to your reply to this correspondance.

Yours Sincerely,

CHALRIAN - PBFOLC.
