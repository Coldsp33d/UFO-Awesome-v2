I
your assurance that no Defence significance is attached to these matters, {
would be of scientific interest if any such material could be made available to
a designated and responsible group.. (I would make it my business to ensure that

you were not in consequence bombarded with similar requests from a multitude of
outside bodies !).

Thank you again for your letter. In the light of it, and noting your
position that nothing of Defence significance arises, may I recapitulate my
requests ? In summary;-it would contribute to serious research if you could now
make available to me:-

a. a copy of the standard form currently in use by the MOD for
- summarising the data reported by the public,the police and the CAA -
Con unidentified events in British airspace and territory;

b. - the data still held by the MOD on these reported events, particularly
any photgraphic material.

PS. I was interested in your comment that "there has never been any formal
liaison with other governments". This used not to be the line when I was
around ! If you care to look up the Official Record for 22 November 1967,
you will find the following exchange between the Hon. & Gallant Member,
Major Sir Patrick Wall, MP, and Mr. Merlyn-Rees, S. of S. for Defence.

WALL : "What exchange of information or other co-operation is taking
place bewteeen his Department and the official American and
Russian investigations into UFOs ?"

M-REES : "We are in touch with the Americans on this subject but not
with the Russians. I understand the conclusions which the
Americans have reached coincide with ours."

This doesn't quite substantiate your "never". I won't embarrass you by
asking you to comment; but you might find it useful for your own purposes
to refer to the Hansard reference and to refresh your memory on what
precisely was the American position at that time and why we went along
with it.
