214 Conclusion: Who Goes There?

b. There are objects probably approximating the shape of a disc, of such appre-
ciable size as to appear to be as large as a man-made aircraft.

c. There is a possibility that some of the incidents may be caused by natural
phenomena, such as meteors.

d. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneu-
verability (particularly in-roll), and action which must be considered evasive
when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief to
the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually, auto-
matically, or remotely.

who has repeatedly expressed his opinion that UFOs are real and who has
been deriied access to top seoret UFO files at Wright-Patterson Air Force

Base, Ohio, despite his status.

A curious set of regulations exists within NASA. Listed in the Code of
Federal Regulations since 1969, 14 CFR 1211, as they are known, provide
for the detention, examination, and decontamination of persons and things
that have come in direct or indirect contact with a person, animal, or other
form of life or matter that has "touched directly or come within the atmo-
spheric envelope of any other celestial body."

Originally designed for our expeditions to the moon and, in fact, insti-
tuted only a few days before the first lunar landing, the regulations can be
applied to space voyages by vehicles not originating from Earth, according
to NASA's general counsel Neil Hosenball. Theoretically, anyone who sees
and approaches a UFO and, if lucky (?) enough, is able to touch the object,
may be liable for a $5,000.00 fine and/or a year in prison if he or she does
not submit to detention.

Now, we don't anticipate that such a thing will ever come down upon
a UFO witness. It would hardly be a way to reward someone with physical
proof of UFO reality! However, another problem surfaces and that is the
fact that when such stories are circulated in the media, a potential witness
could be frightened away from reporting a UFO encounter, The threat of
a fine and prison term for exposing the public to some as yet unknown
peril may be impetus enough to remain silent.

One witness involved in the following encounter had precisely this fear
in mind when he came forward to tell us what he had gone through.

Persistent stories had come out of England about an unidentified fiying
object which had come down into the Rendlesham Forest near the American
Air Force Base at Bentwaters on December 30, 1980. Reports included radar
tracking from a civilian radar site, which later had been visited by US.
Air Force officers with the purpose of confiscating the radar tapes, and ac-
counts by USAF personnel of a metallic craft and entities seen in a clearing
at Rendlesham. The stories, of course, were unverified and little else could
be accomplished unless more concrete data came forth.

'Two British UFO investigators, Brenda Butler and Dot Street, followed

wa af the stories and found substance to them. Reportedly, a
