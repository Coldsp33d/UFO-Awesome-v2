Conclusion: Whi Goes There? . 2s
s»-urity sergeant saw entities associated. with a dome-shaped UFO in the
'W.ds; another witness, an airman, saw marks in the earth characteristic
of what he had heard about UFO landing marks. All witnesses desired com-
plete anonymity, however, and while the story became more intriguing with
the increase in the number of confirming witnesses, it still could not be
considered a strong case by any means. Anonymous witnesses and scattered
rumors are not convincing evidence of anything. ;

While we were putting this book together, a person came forward as
a result of a UFO article he had read. Fascinated by the subject because
of his experience, this individual was eventually put in contact with the authors
and told a very interesting tale. His identity is known to us, but, by his
request, we will change his name to Art Wallace.

Wallace was attached to Bentwaters Air Force Base as a security police»
man. He had been assigned to the base for only a short period of time,
when at 1:00 A.M. on a night either on or very near to December 30, 1980,
his life took a strange twist. While he was on duty at the Bentwaters flight
line, a jeep pulled up. Two men, a sergeant and a Heutenant, told Wallace
to get in because they were going over to the motor pool. On the way over,
Wallace noticed that many animals were running out of the woods nearby;
something he had never seen before, even in the States. When they arrived .
at the motor pool, Wallace and the sergeant were told to get gas-powered
"light-alls" (trailer-mounted lights used for illuminating large areas). The
lights were attached to the jeep, and they proceeded to the Bentwaters main
gate where they met other vehicles.

The convoy moved out toward the Rendlesham Forest a few miles
away. Wallace heard radio chatter mentioning names of people he knew
plus "OSI," most likely a reference to the Air Force's Office of Special Investi-
gations. Wallace saw security police as well as members of the British military
stationed all along the way.

They pulled onto a dirt road and drove about a mile into the Rendlesham
Forest, stopping at what Wallace referred to as a "staging point." The men
were ordered to check their weapons in since they would not be taking them
along. Wallace went into the woods with four other men led by a captain
who had met them at the Bentwaters motor pool. As they approached a
clearing in the woods, they noticed a brightness in the distance and the
sound of helicopters overhead. Wallace noticed an airman crying at the edge
of the clearing with a medic attending him. This puzzled Wallace greatly
as he couldn't imagine what might have been going on. The first thing the
men noticed when they had a.clear view was that large movie cameras had
been placed surrounding a field in the clearing. Many military and plainclothes
personnel were milling about watching something.

The "something" was an object, taking the appearance of a transparent
aspirin tablet, hovering about one foot off the ground. Wallace estimated
that the object was fifty feet in diameter and had a bright, pulsating, yellow
