) inside. It did not move from its position. Wallace and some of the
men approached the object to within about ten feet. Two cows in the field
had come over to the object and according to Wallace, appeared to-be just
staring at it, oblivious to the security men in the area.

A radio call was heard over a field radio unit. A helicopter pilot said,
"Here it comes." In the distance, a red light appeared, first behind a pine
tree, then in front of it. The light quickly sped over to the aspirin-shaped
object and hovered at a position about twenty feet above it. After maintaining
this position for a minute, the red light broke up. No explosion occurred
in the conventional sense. The light merely broke up into a shower of particles.

Suddenly, in the place of the red light and the aspirin-shaped object,
another vehicle appeared. Wallace said it was a domed disc, bright white
in color, with an intricately detailed surface much like the models used in
movies like "Star Wars" and "Close Encounters." It had two appendages
on the lower flange of the disc which seemed to be the beginning of delta
wings but not quite. Shadows were cast on the surface of the dise by some
of the raised-relief detail. Wallace and the men with him walked around
the object and noticed an interesting effect. Their own shadows were cast
onto the object, probably by the bright "light-alls" in the field. Not only
did their shadows bend upwards at the head, but as they walked and then
stopped, the shadows would appear to advance one pace more and then
stop. Stunned and disbelieving of this effect, Wallace and the others walked
and stopped several times, each time noticing the effect repeat itself, Addition-
ally, the third time that they tried this, a light came over the head of a
shadow and moved from one head to another.

Wallace recalled turning to say a few words to one of the men. The
next thing he knew, he woke up in bed, fully dressed and muddy up to his
knees. Wallace asked one of his companions in the barracks what time he
had come in. He replied 4:00 A.M. At that point he did not remember what
had happened that night. As he went about his usual duties, Wallace began
to recall the events.

A. phone call came later in the day. Wallace was summoned to his
commander's office along with other security policemen who were at the
scene of the UFO activity. Civilians were in the office also, giving Wallace
the impression of being CIA personnel. The commander politely advised
the men not to talk about the night's events to anyone. They were brought
into another room where the civilians, much more stem and rude, reminded
the men of their duty and ordered them never to discuss the matter with
anyone. They were checked for radiation, debriefed for an hour, and made
to sign forms which re-emphasized the high security nature of what happened.
Wallace and others were put on a call-in schedule by which they would be
required to phone a certain number daily at 11:30 A.M. as a check on their
whereabouts and activities.
