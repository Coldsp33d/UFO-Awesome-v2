#.. upt to mislead the public and constitutes a blatant violation of the spirit
and the letter of the Freedom of Information Act.

What could be equally as mysterious as the events themselves 'is the
reason why the letter was released in the first place. We probably would
not have known about its existence had it not been given to us. And it
surely doesn't help to make the Air Force's official stance on UFOs credible.
Could there be a segment within the Air Force that wants us to have the
facts on UFOs? It's a distinct possibility.

Our investigation into this most bizarre affair continues.

We have already discussed many of the agencies involved in collecting
reports of UFOs domestically and internationally. One other potential source
of UFO data has not been mentioned only because it has been relatively
unknown until recently through revelations by the New York Times.

The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is an intelligence agency
whose very existence has been classified top secret. It has an extraordinary
budget of $2 billion per year and manages to hide this primarily in Air
Forces operations. It functions in such a manner that nothing about it is
subject to open scrutiny.

The NRO's mission is to monitor international communications (like
the NSA) and to oversee the operation of the nation's spy satellite system.
Government officials have even refused to discuss the agency's name if it
were brought up. How might the NRO's operations relate to UFO research?

Photo-reconnaissance satellites have advanced to sich a degree that
even individuals can be specifically identified from orbits one hundred miles
up. If strange aerial activity were to be detected in space as has been done
in the past by NORAD (see Chapter 1), a photo-reconnaissance satellite
could be expected to be pressed into duty by taking high-resolution photos
of the UFOs. Significant strong evidence for UFOs may currently exist in
the NRO's files but accessability would be virtually impossible under present
security provisions. Such security could also protect an above-top secret ver-
sion of Project Saint (see Chapter 13) in photographing UFO activity.

Let us summarize in detail our conclusions on the UFO subject. (We
refer to the small percentage of total reports which are currently listed as genuine
unknowns:

1) UFOs are a real, material, physical phenomenon, completely unidentifiable
in conventional terms.

2) UFOs display intelligence of a very high order.

3) Granting that UFOs are real and intelligent, somebody is behind the phe-
nomenon; that is, advanced biological life forms.

4) These life forms are here for a purpose. A "clear intent" has been demon-
strated numerous times.
