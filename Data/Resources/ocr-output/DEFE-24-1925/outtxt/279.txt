ooo e Conclusion: Who Goes There?

3) Their purpose at the present time is unknown but may be related to an

w* extended surveillance of what might be termed a primitive, embryonic

society. '

! 6) The origin of the biological life forms is unknown, but the extraterrestrial

' hypothesis seems to be the most attractive explanation, although not the
only one. &

7) UFOs have overfown U.S. military and other government facilities since
World War II, as evidenced by official U.S., document releases from a
variety of federal agencies.

8) This activity has.extended to other nations, as evidenced by official U.S.
government document releases.

9) UFO activity over some US. military/governmental facilities has been
of such a sensational, dramatic nature that a definite threat to U.S. national

i security is considered as fact within the highest levels of government. (This

1 scenario also applies to foreign governments,)

10) Documented UFO reports of national security significance have been and
continue to be withheld, under tight secrecy regulations, from all but the
most highly-placed government officials.

11) Despite tight secrecy regarding release of UFO documents, government
officials most closely associated with UFO data of national security impor-

Part of why this book exists is to urge people with any knowledge of the

and put out before the public for a fair and open-minded assessment of
what is one of the most intriguing topics in recorded: history.

In particular, we solicit any information on the existence of Jong-ru-

showing actual footage of UFOS filmed by people on the ground and by
pilots in the air, equipped with aerial cameras. Additionally, a document

"Estimate of the Situation" is sought. Although the original document was
supposedly destroyed in 1948, copies were known to exist years later.

The "Estimate of the Situation" is a curiosity of UFO history. The
