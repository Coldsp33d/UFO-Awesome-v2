_. Conclusion: Who Goes There? an

concluded that UFOs were interplanetary, according to those few
individuals who saw it, including the former head of Project Blue Book in
the early 1950s, Captain Edward Ruppelt. Ruppelt stated that at least one
copy, legak-sized with a black cover stamped "Secret," survived its original
destruction order. Since then, all attempts to locate the document have failed.
The Air Force's responses to such inquiries have been strangely contradictory.

One letter to a UFO researcher by the Air Force's Director of Legislative
Major General W. P. Fisher, said, "There has never been an Air
Force conclusion that flying saucers were real and were interplanetary space
ships. The alleged 1948 document mentioned in your letter is nonexistent."

Yet, in 1967, the Air Force's Chief, Civil Branch of the Office of Informa-
tion's Community Relations Division, Lt. Colonel George Freeman, said:

Regarding the 1948 "Estimate of the Situation" the late Captain Ruppelt
in his book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, provides the answer.
The Top Secret Estimation was working its way up to the higher echelons
of the Air Force. It got to the late General Hoyt S. Vanderberg, then Chief
of Staff, before it was "batted down." The General wouldn't "buy" interplan-
etary vehicles. The report lacked proof and the Estimate died a quick death.
Some months later, it was completely declassified and relegated to the
incinerator. I am sorry, but we have no copies of this document.

The "Estimate" obviously survived destruction by several accounts. Knowl-
edge of its location would be of great historical importance.

We have tried to give a rational assessment of UFOs, Old questions
have been answered and new ones have been raised. To be sure, UFOs have
not been given a fair day in court, which is why the subject remains cloaked
in rumor and ambiguity. Some scientists are aware of the challenge placed
before us, but the scientific community at large must shoulder some of the
blame for the way the UFO phenomenon has been treated. Scholars have
descended upon UFO enthusiasts in righteous indignation, accusing them
of promoting pseudoscience and misinforming the public to an almost irrever-
sible degree. Indeed, some of the criticism is well-deserved. Serious UFO
researchers were, for some time, a small minority in a subject dominated
by religious fanatics, pseudointellectuals, and a variety of space explorers,
whose alleged trips to "lush, green Venus" and the marvelous cities on the
far side of the moon titillated millions.

Inevitably, the wheat is separated from the chaff and the true nature
of a mystery manifests itself. This is what present-day UFO logists are promot-
ing-a serious look at real events, not a 1980s version of "Earth vs. Flying
Saucers" or "Invaders from Mars."

The U.S. government is convinced that UFOs are a serious matter. It
is only through a concerted effort by the world's braintrust that UFOs can
be dealt with effectively, almost surely leading to the revelation of new
truths.
