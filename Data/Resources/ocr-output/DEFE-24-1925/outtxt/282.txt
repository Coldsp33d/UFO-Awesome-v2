Thank you for your letters of 24 February and 23 March 1985;
I am sorry that I have been unable to reply before now. I regret
that the Department could not justify the expenditure in terms of
time and effort which would be required to collate information on
reports of UFO's in the Dyfed area since 1977. *

 

You may find it useful if I explain that the sole interest of
the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence in reported sightings of
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) is to establish whether they have
any bearing on the defence of the country.

«

There is no organisation in the Ministry of Defence appointed
solely for the purpose of studying reports of such objects, and no
staff sre employed on the subject full time. The reports we receive
are referred to the staff in the Department who are responsible for
the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports
as part of their normal duties.

Since our interest in UFOs is limited to possible defence
implications we carried out a study into the scientific
significance of these phenomena. Unless there are defence
implications we do not attempt to identify sightings and we cannot
inform observers of the probable identity of the object seen. The
Department could not justify the expenditure of public funds on
investigations which go beyond the pure defence interests.

We have to recognise that there are many strange things to be
seen in the sky, but we believe there are adequate explanations for
them. They may be satellite debris re-entering the earth atmosphere,
ball lightning, unusual cloud formations, meteorological balloons,
aircraft lights, aircraft at unusual angles or many other things.
There is certainly no evidence that "alien spacecraft" have landed on
the planét. Although we have not carried out our own studies, we are
aware of independent studies into the UFOs, notably by the University

~' of Colorado published in 1969. This concluded that 90% of all UFOs
reported could be plausibly related to ordinary phenomena. . °
