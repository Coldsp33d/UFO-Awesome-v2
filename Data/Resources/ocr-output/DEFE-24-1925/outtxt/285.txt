Dear Mr Noyes

hank you for your letter of 25 February 1985, addressed to .
who, as I believe you now know, has left this division 4
now See . I am sorry that I have not been able to reply before f

now. Thank you also for sight of the extracts from your proposed
book,.

In his letter of 20 March 198%, R exo aines the
MOD's position regarding Colonel Halt's reports on events near RAF
Woodbridge in 1980, and I have little to add to the views
expressed. I know from your letter that -you are well aware of the
limited extent of the MOD's interest in the subject. Nonetheless,
there are, perhaps, one or two points which I- should make. Firstly,
whilst I cannot, of course, comment on the proportion of UFO
sightings which are not reported, I can assure you that those which
are reported to local police forces and to the Civil Aviation
Authority should all be passed on to this division of the MOD. We
treat all these reports seriously in case they show anything of
defence interest. However, we have never found any reason to believe
that, in the defence context, such reports warrant more detailed
research. Equally, since our interest extends only as far as defence
of the UK, there has never been any formal liaison with other
Governments.

Turning to your specific questions about the Woodbridge
incident, I can assure you that no unidentified object was seen on
any radar recordings during the period in question, and that the MOD
has no knowledge of the tape-recording or cine film you mention. As
we have said in the past, the report sent by Colonel Halt was
examined by those in the Department responsible for the air defence
of the UK and since then there has been nothing to alfer the view
that there was no defence significance to the incident.

Yours sincerely
