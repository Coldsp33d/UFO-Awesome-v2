I attach copies of two recent Parliamentary Questions on the
Ministry of Defence's interest in UFO reports, which you may be
interested in.

Thank you for your interest in this matter, I am returning the
negatives which you kindly loaned to RAF Manston. I am afraid I
cannot explain the objects which appear in the photographs, however,
if they were not visible in the sky at the time the pictures were
taken, it is likely that they are, in fact, blemishes on the
negatives, possibly produced during the developing process.

Yours sincerely
