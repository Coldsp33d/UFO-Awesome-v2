to my satisfaction how light-
houses manage to Oy in a
blaze of lights nor how rab-
bits give off radiation.

The three authors have
also produced some fascinat-
ing supplementary evidence
and Ralph Noyes, former
head of the MoD department
responsbile for RAF intelli-
gence, said in a statement:
"We now bave evidence -- I
blush to say about my own
Ministry -- that they have
Hed about this case. They
have covered it up."

Conspiracy

And so the conspiracy of

Their book raises some
about
the USAF bases in Rast An-
glia in view of Mrs Thatch:
er's decision to allow them
to be used by F111 bombers
for the attack on Libya.

Quite clearly we have little
control aver the bases and,
when - something . untoward
eccurs, lose no thine in help-
ing the US cover it up.

1 do not believe that the
UPO _ which disturbed. the
Suffolk woodland on that
wintry night carried some
spooky visitors from a dis-
tant planet.

No, the explanation is
much simpler. A UFO it was
- an American, mlltary
spacecraft which had been
on an illegal mission in
outer space years ahead of
President Reagan's beloved
Star Wars programme,

Service for the army of unemployed

our streets.

Ob, I know all about freedom of
the individual and suchlike, but can
any of us who did our stint in
uniform honestly say we did not
thoroughly enjoy it?

I will not infllet you with such
rubbish as: "It will make men of
them" or "A bit of discipline will
sort that lot out".

My experience in the Army was
that it did neither. More Important,
it showed us how people from all
parts of the country, of all classes,
colours and religions, could live in
harmony. It also gave us a chance
to see the world beyond these
shores, and taught us how to look
after ourselves.

I hope the spirit of those times
will be capt in an exhibition on
National Service, opening at the
Imperial War Museum In London
next September, Altogether some
250,000 of us were conscripted be-
tween 1940468.

What a laugh it all was. My post-
bay suggests that others came away
with the same impression.

Patrick Moore, from Bromagrove,
sends me a British Armed Forces 8
voucher (BAFs, we called them)
with the comment: "I think I picked
it up in Berlin or .. or was
it Mauritius or Madagascar?"

Ah, sweet memories, he says. Tll
second that.

Erie Firth, from Wilsden, Yorks,
would not agree. He was a regular
soldier who served 14 years, and
reckons National Service was a
waste of time, money, manpower
and lives.

He writes: "Young men around 18
were. plucked from _ their _ jobs,
homes 'and loved ones, put into
ugly, uniforms that made
them resemble walking coal sacks,
and dispatched to a variety of inter-
national destinations."

Well, you could say that. How-
ever, the youngsters 1 am talking
about have no jobs to be plucked
from. And that is the most dreadful
waste of all.

Saudis seek to offset !

British Tornado dea

From A Correspondent, Riyadh . >

Mr George Younger, the
Defence Secretary. met Prince
Sultan bin Abdul. Aziz, his
Saudi counterpart, yesterday
to discuss Saudi proposals for
British investment 10 offset
# billion Tornado fighter

The investment programme
would be similar to that
imposed on a consortium of
companies led by Bocing. The
consortium had to invest 35
per cent of a $1.2 billion
contract to provide ground
control for the airborne warn-
ing - and - control | system
(Awacs} jets sold to the Saudis
by the Americans.

The difference is that the

US- offset  progratime is
stipulated | before ' contracts
were signed with private com-
panies. No such prior agree-
ment was reached before the
Tornado deal was signed.

Mr Younger is expected to
meet King Fahd and other
important Saudi officials dur-
ing his three-day visit, which
may lead to another arms deal
if a $357 million (about £238
million) afr-io-air and ai-to-
ship missile package fails to
clear the US Congress. The
Saudis: may again. look to
Britain to fill the gap as they
did when they bought the
Tornados | instead _ of . the
American-built FIS. fighters
they originally wanted.
