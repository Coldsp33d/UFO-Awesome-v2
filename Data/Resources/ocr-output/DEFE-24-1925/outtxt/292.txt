>- Rep:
Your Ref: D/Sec(As}/12/3

Thank you for your letter of the 16th instant informing

me that as far as your staff at the Knightsbridge Military
Barracks are concerned no mysterious shining flying object
was sighted by them on the 21st December 1984 and 2lst Jan'85.

May be what my colleagues and I saw on the above dates was

an illusion on our part and, therefore, I would ask you to

accept my apologies for wasting everybody's time unnecessarily.
