Re, The U.F.0. problem.

 

Dear Nrs Thatcher,

I Have seen authentic reports on UFOs from the Police to
Military in this country (not in breach of National Security), and
I have been doing this for the past 30 yeare privately, and now I
am starting to see many more reports coming in via the US courts,
but these reports are, some of them, still classified SECHET here.

In 1952 while I was in the military in the far-east the
whole base I was on, was subjected to close UFO scrutiny, but even
today, with all the evidence recorded at the time, Whitehall will

not say more than deny the incident, and therefore I am forced to

 

let things go for the seke of the governiment.
I am fascinated to know what our government has found out

on the subject of UFOs since they started coming in large waves
from 1947 onwards,.

sincerily
