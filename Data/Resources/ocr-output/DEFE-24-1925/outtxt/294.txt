Dear Members of Ministry of Defence

I have read several hundred British newepaper articles of so-called

"flying saucers" or unidentified flying objects.

For that reason I decided to ask you for some information about the subject.
How many reports of UFCs you have received after World War II and have you
any office or staff investigating the matter? Have you any printed matter
on the subject?

And I ask for photostatic copy of the famous ufo-article published in

RAF Flying Review July 1957 (it is an unofficial magazine, but it is in your
library).

I have received similar hemp from other forsign ministries and I want this
type of information for my private library. And I have been interested in
ufo-problem for twenty years.

I am Waiting for your reply.

Sincerely Yours

F ION L A K D
