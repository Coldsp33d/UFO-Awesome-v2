Thank you for your letter of 11 March 1985 addressed to the
Secretary of State for Defence, We have looked into the sightings
reported in your letter but have no records which would offer any
explanation of what you saw.. You may find it useful if I explain
that the sole interest of the Ministry of Defence in reported
sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects is to establish whether they
have any bearing on the defence of the country.

There is no organization in the Ministry of Defence appointed
solely for the purpose of studying reports of such objects, and no
staff are employed on the subject full time. The reports we receive
are referred to the staff in the Department who are responsible for
the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports
as part of their normal duties. Unless there are defence impli-
cations we do not attempt to identify sightings and we cannot inform
observers of the probable identity of the object seen. The Depart-
ment could not justify the expenditure of public funds on
investigations which go beyond the pure defence interests,

Yours sincerely
