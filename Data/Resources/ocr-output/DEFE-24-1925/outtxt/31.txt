Thank you for your letter of 12 December and your reminder of

18 March, I am sorry that it has taken me so long to reply.

March ,

To answer your two easier questions first:

1. The form which was sent to you -+ R : -- of
6 December is complete, ie nothing was omitted before sending
it on to you.

2. I am afraid I can be of little help to you on the
reported sightings in North Yorkshire during August. We
received only one report during the month which is very
sketchy indeed (copy attached), and I have no knowledge of any
of the claims alluded to in your letter.

As to the study which you mentioned in your letter of 18
work is in hand at the moment to trace the document. I must

admit that I was unaware of such a study and this is the reason why

it has

not been referred to in the past. Should we manage to locate

it I will of course let you know.
