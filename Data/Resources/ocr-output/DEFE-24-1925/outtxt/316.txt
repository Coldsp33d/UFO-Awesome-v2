Your Excellency,

Being a Tory Party supporter I would like to bring to

your kind attention that I have delivered myself personally
three letters to your Knightabridge Military Barracks
requesting them to let me know what the shining flying object
we saw on 21st December 1984 and 21st January 1985 is, but

no reply or acknowledgement has been received from them so far.

   

I enclose herewith copies of my letters, in this connection,
for your information and shall be grateful if you would kindly
instruct them to comply with my request.

% ¥Hank you in anticipation of your kind help in this matter.
