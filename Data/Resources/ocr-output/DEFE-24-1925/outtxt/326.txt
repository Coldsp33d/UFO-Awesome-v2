f N ogg) to identify the subject image and therefore contacted the local

police at Scarborough,. At approximately 3.30pm, some 90 minutes after observing
the phenomena, the witness was contacted by personnel at Fylingdales, They asked

-Sue would be grateful for a copy of the report held by your base. Ministry of Defence
«policy is not to release 'UFO' reports due in the main for witness confidentiality
purposes. However the witness requires no such assurance and therefore the non-
release of this report would perhaps indicate one potential. RAF Fylingdales has
the capability to track just about anything anywhere and one must pressume the
advanced system used by your base received a return from this target?

We would be pleased to forward a detailed copy of -: .~; informat~
ion received will be used for research purposes only. Thank you for your time and

we look forward to receiving your reply.
