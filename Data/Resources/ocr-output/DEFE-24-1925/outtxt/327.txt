Our Ref: ¥L1 No. of Pages:

Subject: Massey/Goddard/Dowding 'UFO' Research

With.reference to a letter dated 3rd December 1984 forwarded to your Dept.

Tn that letter we submitted a number of specific reports in the hope that
these would constitute some kind -of information which would help you find
data obtained by the above named officials, However MoD response has been
nil. Perhaps tle following information may help you trace any documents
which are- held in relation to this research;« - '

We have found new information that the 'project' was started by Lieutenat
General Maesey in 1943. This was specifically designed to study the unknown
phenomenon termed 'Foo Fighters' by the R.A.F. However, it is quite clear to
everyone concerned with UFO research that the German pilots witnessed such
phenomena and both parties felt that 'the other' side had constructed a
secret weapon,.

Perhaps this type of phenomena was natural? In any event we would appreciate
some response to this request and any information held on this type of
aerial phenomenon.

Thank you for your valuable time.
