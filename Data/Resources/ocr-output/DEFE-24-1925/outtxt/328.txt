Esq., *

Head of D58,
Ministry of Defence.

You may remember that I wrote to you in November 1983.about the
reported occurrence of unusual events near RAF Woodbridge in December 1980. Your
reply, D/DS8/10/209 of 20th March 1984, told me that the MOD saw no Defence
significance in Colonel Halt's report of 13th January 1981. You suggested that
the events reported by him probably reflected some entirely down-to-earth, but
misperceived, phenomenon.

I am aware that DS8 has had several approaches on this matter from
outside groups and individuals who possibly show more enthusiasm than judgement
in the questions they press. I hesitate to place a further burden on the patience
and courtesy of your Division. Nonetheless, there do remain some puzzling, and
perhaps disquieting, features of this case on which I think it would be in the
general interest to cast some further light.

I owe it to you to explain my interest. It lies in the following -

not necessarily in the right order of priority !

First, as an ex-MOD chap, I have been asked from time to time by
various bits of the media to comment on the Woodbridge affair. I have in fact
done so on several occasions on local radio and on foreign television. One of
the television programmes is now likely to beshown here before long and may
excite some public interest. If I am invited to comment again, I would not wish
to do so irresponsibly. Â°

Secondly, I am publishing a book this June on the UFO phenomenon
generally, My publishers are keen that it should say something about Woodbridge.
I have already drafted a passage which reflects my own study of the case, and I
am attaching to this letter the relevant extracts which deal with it. I do not,
of course, expect you to comment on this (unless you wish to do so), but I feel

itis no more than proper to give former colleagues some advance notice of what
I am proposing to publish.

Thirdly,- as the attached extract implies, I have come to the con-
clusion over the past year or so - somewhat reluctantly and by no means hastily -
that something of importance (and something which is not illusory) underlies the
persistent stream of reports of well authenticated oecurrences, both in the UK
and elsewhere, which can be loosely grouped under the UFO heading. Some of these
reports reach the MOD from members of the public (and they doubtless also continue
to do so from Service establishments as well); but a far larger number get no
further than the local police, civil aviation authorities, or the amateur research
groups. These occurrences may or may not prove to have any vital interest for
Defence, and the Woodbridge case may or may not properly belong among them. But

the sizable and persistent hard core of the more disquieting instances - particul-
arly those in which there appears to be some degree of temporary interference
with electronic equipment and/or minor damage to individuals and the environment -
