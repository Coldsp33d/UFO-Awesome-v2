seems to me to deserve closer and more expert attention in Whitehall than we are

led to believe it gets at present. There is evidence that at least three other
governments take the phenomenon seriously. A mass of documents released in the

US- under the American Freedom of Information Act shows a close and continuing
interest by governmental agencies. The French agency GEPAN (Groupe d'Etudes des
PhenonBnes Aérospatiaux Non-identifiés) which was set up by the then French M
Minister of Defence in 1977 under CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) rem-
ains in existence despite the heavy retrenchment in French government expenditure
and continues to collect and analyse UFO reports country-wide. And there is a
degree of recent evidence in the Soviet Press that the Russians take a close
interest in the phenomenon through the Moscow Aviation Institute and (possibly)
the National Academy of Sciences, Is it really the case that the British MOD
takes no systematic interest (as distinct from dealing ad hoc with what are felt

study of the phenomenon, viz. something in the nature of a small expert committee

I hope that- you will feel able to comment on the three questions at
the end of the preceding paragraph. I ask them, not in any spirit of contention,
but because I believe that we cannot afford to ignore a persistent phenomenon
which other countries appear to take seriously. It seems to me to deserve systematic
study within a Defence context, even if only to dismiss it in the end as trivial.
I think you will know that there are others;whose judgement is to be respected and
whose experience qualifies them,who take a similar view, Lord Hill-Norton among
them.

To return to the particular case of RAF Woodbridge, you may already
be aware that television documentaries of the occurrence have been made by two
foreign companies, The programme made by Cable News Network is now likely to be
shown in this country before long. I have not yet seen the documentary in full,
myself, but I understand from the organisation that they claim to have established
a number of facts which are very much at odds with the view that Col. Halt and
other USAF personnel merely misperceived some phenomenon with a wholly conventional
explanation (the Orfordness lighthouse, a satellite re-entry, a bright meteor).
The following are among the more important points which Cable appear to be claiming.

1. Col. Halt adheres to the report of 13th January 1981, of which the MOD
has a copy. He also confirms the authenticty of a tape-recording made by
himself on site on the night of 29th December 1980 which tallies with
paragraph 3 of his report (and in some respects goes beyond it).

2. Other witnesses to the events of 27th and 29th-December 1980 reported
by Halt have made sworn depositions.

3. Although not reported by Halt, there was an unusual occurence near
RAF Woodbridge on the night of 26th December 1980. An unidentified object
in an area of Rendlesham Forest sufficiently worried USAF personnel to
cause them to seek help from the Suffolk police. Police officers at
Woodbridge (the village) have confirmed that they responded to this call,
albeit without establishing unambiguous evidence at the site of the
'sighting' claimed by the USAF contingent which had been sent to investi-
gate it.

4. There is evidence that RAF Watton (and perhaps other radar installations)
had radar traces on at least one of the three nights in question of an
unidentified aerial object in the area of RAF Woodbridge/Rendlesham Forest.

5. There is evidence that a l6mm cine-film was made at the site by USAF
personnel on 29th December 1980 and was referred for study by the USAF
headquarters in Germany.
