This is just to remind you that I have yet to receive a reply to my various letters.
I know that you have been busy but hope that you will be able to respond shortly.

I recently tried to obtain a copy%ér view the Air Ministry Secret Intelligence Summary

on UFOs, referred to in correspondence between Duncan Sandys and Anthony Montague Brown

in 1955 (Cabinet papers released at the end of last year), and the PRO told me that it had
not yet been released and suggested I contact the MoD with a view to seeing it, or at least
finding out when it will be released. I enclose the relevant reference material.
