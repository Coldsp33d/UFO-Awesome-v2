In your letter to me of 20th March 1984 you said, "The Department satisfied
itself at the time that there was no reason to consider that the alleged sightings
had any Defence significance". You added, "I can assure you ... that there is no
evidence of anything having intruded into British airspace and 'landing' near RAF
Woodbridge". In the light of the research which Cable News Network claim to have
undertaken I hope you will not think it unréssonable if I invite your- replies to
the following questions.

1. What steps were taken-by the MOD when Col. Halt's report of 13 January 1981
was received in the Department ? In particular:-

a. What consultations took place with the USAF ?
b. Was any on-site investigation made by MOD or British Service personnel 7

c. Was any enquiry made to RAF Watton or other radar establishments for

- possible traces of an unidentified occurrence in the Suffolk area on

the nights of 26/27, 27/28 and 29/30 December 1980 ? If so, what was
the outcome ?

2. Is the MOD aware of the tape-recording which Col.. Halt claims to have made
on 29 December 1980 (and of which alleged copiés are now in the hands of
several members-of the public) ? If so, what interpretation does the MOD
place on this recording ?

3. Is the MOD aware of the cine-film allegedly made on site on 29th December 1980 ?
If so, what interpretation is placed upon it ?

4. In the light of the answers to these questions does the MOD adhere to its
view that nothing unknown or untoward intruded into British airspace in
late December 1980 ? Is this also the view of the USAF ?

4. If this does indeed remain the MOD's considered conclusion, does the Dep-
artment feel any disquiet at an apparent and persistent misperception of
presumably innocent phenomena by USAF personnel based at an important inst-
allation in British territory and charged with military tasks the mismanage-
ment of which might have grave consequences ?

I regret burdening you with these questions and with those contained in my sixth

paragraph above. But I think they are potentially important, and I doubt that we
have heard the last of them.
