It grieves me to add that I think we have some evidence of direct and delib-
erate mis-statement on the part of the Ministry of Defence in at least one important
case, the occurrence of strange events on two nights in late December 1980 in a part
of Rendlesham Forest adjoining the USAF Base at RAF Woodbridge. We have the evidence
for these events in a statement signed on 13th January 1981 by the then Deputy Base
Commander, 'Lt.Col. (now e ) Charles Halt of the United States Air
Force. This statement was not made public until 14th June 1983 when - following
persistent pressure by the authors of CLEAR INTENT (see above) - its release was
authorised by the USAF in America under the Freedom of Information Act. Whether this
release was an inadvertency at rather low level in the USAF we may never know: despit
the Freedom of Information Act, American agencies have proved perfectly capable (and
often no doubt with good reason) of sustaining objections in the courts to the rel-
- eage-0f documents,-There-is-certainly- some -evidence-that -Halt-was-not - consulted about

the release and that it somewhat dismayed him. Be that as it may, however, the lette
of release included the extraordinary statement that the USAF had disposed of its om
copy of Halt's report but that: "... through diligent inquiry and the gracious conse
of Her Majesty's government, the British Ministry of Defence and the Royal Air Force.
the US Air Force was provided a copy for you." The Ministry of Defence have confirm
in reply to a Parliamentary Question tabled by Major Sir Patrick Wall, MP, that a
copy of Halt's report was indeed received by them. Yet we are told in a recent book -
SKYCRASH by Brenda Butler, Dot Street and Jenny Randles (Neville Spearman, Face 1984;
that the Ministry of Defence had flatly denied any knowledge of supposedyt Rendlesh:
Forest when enquiries were made to them in 1981, following strong local rumours of ai
extraordinary occurrence.

The Ministry of Defence may well have good reasons for witholding information
about the Rendlesham incidents. As a former Defence péficial,1 would not wish to
press questions on any matter touching netional security; and in those circumstances
I would not be surprised if questions pressed by others were met by a refusal to
reply. But I cannot help feeling that it is something of a lapse from the usual
standards of a government department to issue a direct mis-statement. Concealment is
one thing (and is often justified), false denial is quite another.

The RAF Woodbridge case of December 1980 strikes me as one of the most interes
ing and important of recent years, anyway in this country - perhaps the most signifi-
cant military sighting (or supposed sighting) since the celebrated events of 13th/14
August 1956 near RAF Bentwaters and RAF Lakenheath (both of which are, by an enter-
taining coincidence, quite close to Woodbridge in that much-haunted county of Suffol
Those who wish to study the Bentwaters/Lakenbesth incidents will find descriptions
of them in the books mentioned below. The RAF Woodbridge case is described at length
in SKYCRASH (see above). It is also to be the subject of several radio and televisio
programmes. Much was said about it in THE NEWS OF THE WORLD in 1983, mainly in its
issues of 2nd and 9th October. Alone in Fleet Street, the then editor, Derek Jameson
decided to give space to Halt's report; and Keith Beabey of THE NEWS OF THE WORLD
pursued it vigorously in the face of the kind of ridicule which the "quality" news-
papers seem to find it expedient to attach to this mysterious and persistent phenom-
enon. ©
It was the Woodbridge case which prompted me to take up a long-shelved intenti
to write a "UFO book". I have chosen, quite deliberately, to cast it as a piece of
fiction. Fiction allows the imagination to range widely, and it seems to me that thi
can sometimes be productive in turning better-qualified minds to mew aspects of a
problem. A false hypothesis can often have as much heuristic value as a good one !
It does, at the least, enable serious researchers to consider = and properly test -
a new idea, even if only to throw it away when it fails to stand up to scrutiny. I a
far from being wedded to the hypothesis on which A SECRET PROPERTY is based. The
main object of the book is to entertain, and to do so in the form of a thriller. It
most certainly does not reflect any inside knowledge or startling revelation on the
part of a former Defence official. (If I had such knowledge, the Official Secreta Ac
would forbid me to reveal it !). '
