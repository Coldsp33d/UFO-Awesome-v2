S1 January 1985

I will skip the introductions, as we both know who. one another is.I apologise for
placing several requests in one letter, but trust that you will bide with me.

 

1: RAF Woodbridge 2] December 1980s I realise we have discussed this matter at
length, but a great deal of vital new information has come our way since concluding
our book "SKY CRASH" last year. I would like to pose some specific questions to you:=

(a) What is your position regarding the involvement of the British civilian police
in the taking of photographs of the landed object? We have excellent evidence for
this, and presume that the British police would advise the MoD.If not, then why not?

(b) You have doubtless seen the extensive "smear" campaign being successfully waged
by the British media (under whose guidance I wonder?).Eg "The Guardian",5 Jan 1985.
On this thesis a gross mistake was mde (& lighthouse seriousky misperceived,backgrour
radiation levels viewed as sinister,rabbit holes regarded as something else). Not onl;
that ,but this "evidence" was supported by the US deputy base commander and the UK
base commander,whom 17 days later could surely have figured some of these cocke»eups ow
This grand blunder is then perpetuated over the course of years;the UK commander
remains in charge, the two base commanders (US), at the time and sybsequently,endorse
all the evidence (we have it in writing) and the deputy commander gets promoted to
base commander. Now regardless of what sort of MoD investigation into these events
was (or was not) conducted this leaves one with a serious dilemma.IF the "lighthouse/
normal radiation/rabbits" theory is correct then gl] your strategic commanders at a
NATO base (for whigh you certainly have jurisdictioh) are incompetent dodos who might
be expected to misinterpret Orford Ness lighthouse for an invading MIG jet,not have

a clue whether they have been irradiated by an exploding neutron bomb, and waste a
great deal of the war filling in bomb potholes made by the Rendlesham Forest wildlife!
I think the people of this country might be rather worried if that were the case. And
frankly, unless you can help us refute this lighthouse nonsense then we are just
going to have to make sure the Bputish people see this interesting paradox.Believe me
we have people in the right place to make sure this happens Comments please.

(c) Since it is vital to the [RRR theory that tne gate not be 27 Decemper 1980,
but 26 December,then have you any way of confirming or denying : the real date? Of cour:
the Halt memo to you says the 27th, but that is dated 17 days later ani @
suggests that he just made yet another mistake.(In view of such a plethora of errors
how could Halt possibly have merited & base commandership?) However, some sort of
action must have ocourred between 26/27 December and the 13 January memo; either at
your end, elsewhere in government, or at the base. The correct date would have been
essential to confirm or refute options (eg a spy-plane mission).So I am sure there
are ways you can look into this. I am not asking for details - just a statement
regarding your level of gonfidence in the Halt memo dating.
