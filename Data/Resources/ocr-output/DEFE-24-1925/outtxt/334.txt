21 We are investigating an incident dated 2 August 1984 from Salisbury Plain, Wilts.
"This occurred at 23.00 BST and was reported by R n_ £25 0
Bedfordshire.We have received excellent cooperation from them and from PG (C-" Ye

the Kitchin police, who investigated the matter at their request on 3 August. The
matter was reported to the MoD,as both witness and police affirm. We recognise that
certain aspects of the case fit a milktary manouvre that was going on that night;
although some puzzles remain. It would help us in our resolution of this case if you
could offer any data you have at your end. I know you regard things as confidential,
and that you have decided not to release data generally. I respect the reasoning for hw
But here I am making & specific request with the backing of police and witnesses, so
there is no real purpose in confidentiality. Any records you have for that event /or
potentially related events on the same night would help.

31 Finally I am making & request for any information you may have regarding an
incident which occugred around midnight on the night of 23-24 August 1984 in fhe
vicinity of Tpswich. We have details of an in-flight collision between an aircraft
and something (which at this point we have no reason to suspect is UFO related).

The airport involved and the investigators of the have been helpful.But it
would be useful to have any data which the MoD have at their disposal on this affair.
If you have any reporys of sightings around this time it would be interesting to °
kmow; although in this case there is more than a fair chance the source was not a
UFO-related phenomenon.

  
  
 

I address my commubication direct to or the current section head of

D5 8, rether th R I wow courteously asserts that he

is the person we should communicate with, but with a1l1 due respect we have good
reason for in this instance not doing so. No offence on intended. I |
am sure he is very able at his job. And our reasons for contacting direct |

are not personal.

Yours sincerely,

 

(Director of Investigations)
