T am writing in response to the letter recieved, dated 9 March

1982. As my infomation can no longer be concidered as classified, I am now able to
pass it onto you.

The letter that I sent to you, was only a small fraction, of the work that I had
done on U.F.0. research, I was in fact in physical and psychic contact with an E.T.
called Algar; whom I have Rad a relationship with since 1958, and it continued until
T9BT, when he was killed by another race of beings.

So to start at the beginning. I was seven years old, when I first saw traces left
by a U.F.0. At the time I lived at mae One Sate
urday, morning I had the impression that I should go out to the back, so much it was

like an obsession(DTA T}. when I did go to the back, I found three indentations in
the ground, they were in triengular formation. Each indentation was the same distance
from it's partner, and they gave the impression that three lange ball bearings had
been dropped there,. My first thought was that it was a U.F.0.; but I had never ever
heard of U.P.0. or flying saucers, and yet the thought seemed normal to me, as if I
used i% on a regular basis, I told my father, who was rather quick at ridiculing

and poo-pooing what I had told him, Anyway, a couple of months later, the first
visit came from R.T.s, which was followed by a few more. They were of green gas
which solidified whem it came in from the passage way,which led to the toilet under,
the door, and the wardrobe, which was situated against the door preventing it from
opening, (DIA 2). There was one which was green and very large, that had eyes all
over it, this one came three times. Then there was a woman with very sharp features,
and what looked like fat worms sticking out of her head, where the hair should be.
The last visit from the latge green thing happenend when my father tried to get into
the bedroom, as veual I was against the door, witiiffear. Ny father was at the time,
fsirly atheleltic and no weakling, but no matter how hard he pushed he could not get
the door open; not until the large green thing had gone.
