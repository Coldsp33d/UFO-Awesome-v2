> [Section 40
: 1959, I found semi-transparent, slug like creatures crawling up the wall on
i

 

 

the opposite side of the back. 4t this period of time I in with a band, espec-
ially,the lead sinc Roi and the drummer Both of them saw the
creatures, The end product of this was that we armed oursel and started to shoot
them, we used +22 air rifles at a range of fifty to seventy five yards. When we did
kill them, they fell off the wall and took on the appearence of cement that hai got
damp and solidified, Quite often they would fall and appear to go through the ground
leaving no trace at all, One day we found that we were unable to hit our targets, and
we conld see our shots pass through the targets, by the ricochete off the wall, and
after that we found that it was a waste of time trying to shook them, so we gave up
mo a bad job. (DTA 3}.

 

I was stationed at Keogh Barracks - Sept. 1968 April 1969 - when I was in the
R.A.M.C,, and Alger was with me then, even in spite of other Â®.T.s going away. A
strong bond was forming of friendship and trust. One incident involves telepathic .
contact, and that occured, following an incident when I was unusually indesisive. I%
was when I wes on guerd duty, and T was asked if I would like the first tour, to which
I normally said yes, but thank Cod I eventually declined, for the first crit-
ically injured with the pick elf he was carrying. It was onethe basis of safety, that
we were to go in pairs from then on,.and it was under these conditions that I got a
telepathic link with Algar. We were returning to the guard house after our patrol, and
to cur right was a field, which haf lighting only on the road on which we were walk-
ing. Apart from the lighting mentioned, the field was totally dark, I heard only what
I can describe as a whisper, and it was saying that someone was creeping about in
the field, to the front and slightly right. I immediatly looked in that direction
but saw nothing,. But as I had heard this whisper several times before, and it hal
proved accurate, T decided to follow it through, I sent my partner around the camp
museum, which was situated about twenty yards behind usy and I went to a lamp, and
prepared to go into the field. It was at this point, when someone came out of the
dark, I then called my partner and after a few heated words, I convinced the stranger
who had no i.d. on him, to accompany us to the guard house. (DIA 4).

The real work began in May, 1979, when my wife and I formed a team, and together
we collected such data-as;- what the different coloured lights on a U.F.0. means,
how they manage to evade radar, what fuel they use and what it looksClike, I have been
to their bases which were in Wirral and Cheshire. There was a curious incident which
took place over the river Mersey, by the Wallasey Town Hall, There were six U.F.O.s f

- flying at speed up and down the river, when I noticed a black one was trying tovman-

ecuvere the other six. Unfortunately,,the black one was shot down, it hit the water i
in front of the Town Hall. As T was watching , the front and of the U.F.O. hit the
water, then the whole U.F.0. dissapeared; leaving the water to splash, as if done by
an invisible entity.
