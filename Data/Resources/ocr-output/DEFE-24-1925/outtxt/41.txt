Many thanks for your letter of 5th March 1986,
concerning the appearence of circles at various locations throughout
Southern England, and for the copy of the report, As it turns out I
already have a complete copy { including names ) of this report which
I obtained during the course of my investigations.

Whilst I understand, from previous correspondance from the
Ministry, that your interest in UFO's and related subjects is
restricted to possible defence implications, and that for financial
reasons involvement in scientific studies would not be considered,

I felt sure that in this case you would have had more information.
Throughout the press coverage, both TV and newspapers, there has been
more than the usual indication that the MOD were involved. To quote
one press report from August 1985 :-

'The Army have begun investigations into the markings for the
Ministry of Defence and photographs were being taken by Helicopter
during the week,'

Initielly 1 thought that this actually refered to the
report ~ which you sent to me, but have since been
told that this is not the case by several sources, some of whom
contacted me as a result of the enclosed article,

Obviously if you have no other information regarding this
perticular case then there is nothing more to be said. However should
anything more come to light concerning this or anything similar I
would appreciate being kept in mind if such information could be passed
on.
