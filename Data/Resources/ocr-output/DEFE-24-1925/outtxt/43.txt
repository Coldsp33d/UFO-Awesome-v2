5Â° March 1986

 

Thank you for your letter of 5 September 1985; I am returning
e stamped addressed envelope which you provided. . You may find
it useful if I explain that the sole interest of the United Kingdom
Ninistry of Defence in reported sightings of Unidentified Flying
Objects (UFOs) is to establish whether they have any bearing on the
defence of the country.

  

There is no organisation in the Ministry of Defence appointed
solely for the purpose of studying reports of such objects, and no
staff are employed on the subject full time. The reports we receive
ere referred to the staff in the Department who are responsible for
the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports
s part of their normal duties.

 

Since our interest in UFOs is limited to possible defence
implications we have not carried out a study into the scientific
significance of these phenomena. Unless there sre defence
implications we do not attempt to identify sightings and we cannot
inform observers of the probable identity of the object seen. The
Department could not justify the expenditure of public funds on
investigations which go beyond the pure defence interests.

On the specific question of the circles found in fields in
southern England, I can confirm that the Army Air Corps at Middle
Wallop have submitted a report on one such occurrence at Clatford. A
copy of this report is attached for your information. As you will
see, no mention is made of a "white jelly" and I can assure you that
to the best of our knowledge no such substance was found at the
scene.
