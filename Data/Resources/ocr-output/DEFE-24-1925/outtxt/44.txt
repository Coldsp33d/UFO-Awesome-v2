 

You will of course appreciate that this is not strictly a
report of a UFO sighting, although this phenomenon, which I
understand has been reported on a number of times in various
locations since the last war, is indeed mystifying. However ue have
et to find anything to suggest that it has any significance in
defence terms.

 

Tours sincerely
