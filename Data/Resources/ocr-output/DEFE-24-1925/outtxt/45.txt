$" March 1986

Thank you for your letter of 8 September. I do apologise for
not writing to you sooner, but I can only say that yours "slipped
through the net'. Â©

You may find it useful if I explain that the sole interest of
the United Kingdom Kinistry of Defence in reported sightings of
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) is to establish whether they have
any besring on the defence of the country.

Since our interest in UFOs is limited to possible defence
implications we have not carried out & study into the scientific
nificance of these phenomena. Unless there are defence
implications we do not attempt to identify sightings and we cannot
inform observers of the probable identity of the object seen. The
Department could not justify the expenditure of public funds on
investigations which go beyond the pure cefence interests.

   
  

He have to recognise that there are many strange things to be
seen in the sky, but we believe there are adequate explanations for
then. They may be satellite debris re-entering the earth atmosphere,
bell lightning, unususl cloud formations, meteorological balloons,
eircraft lights, aircraft at unusual angles or many other things.
rhaps, as you yourself point out, the facet that the GLC Fireworks
display was taking place answers your question.

 

   

1 am sorry that I can do no more to assuage your curiosity.

Yours sincerely
