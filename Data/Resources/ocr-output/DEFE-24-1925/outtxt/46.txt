Dear Sir,

It is now 2 months since my letter to the above and as yet I have received no reply
apart from a small: post card merely acknowledging receipt of my letter,

I would Appreciate a eply to my letter dated the 11 December 1985 at the ealiest
opportunity.I know my last letter was addressed to Mr Heseltine but a reply-from the
new Secretary: of State for:Defence will be more than adequate »

If you could give we some idea as to when (I hope not if} I will receive a reply I will
be most grateful. >

ours Sincere
