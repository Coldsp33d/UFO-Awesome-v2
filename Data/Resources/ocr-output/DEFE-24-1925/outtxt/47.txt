ALIEN _-
INVASION
OR HOAX?

 

Forseveral years, southem Britain -
has experienced what some ©
people claimis the work of
pranksters and others sayis
evidencethat UFO's have

fancied Charles Walker .
investigates the mysterious circles
which have again appeared

 

~My attention was first drawn to these

~ strange circles when a set of five, one

large surrounded by four smaller ones,
appeared in a wheatfield at Patching,
Sussex.. They appeared: some . time
'between 1pm on 28.June and dawn on 29
June 1985. The central and largest of the
circles measured some 50ft in diameter
and the four smaller ones 15ft in diameter.
The wheat had been neatly. flattened
by & swirling motion in a clockwise
«direction.
'~The circles were a reasonable distance
. from the road and, at the time they were
discovered, there was no trace of any of
the surrounding crop having been flat-
tened as it would have been if anyone had
walked into the field to select the site. For
this reason it was suggested that the

~ marks . would have to be made 'by

something landing on the spot, My initiat
enquiries revealed that most people were

of the opinion that a UFO was responsi-...

there- were those who
preferred to dismiss it as a hoax, although
they have. not: provided -a suitable
explanation as to how this could be done

' 'without damaging the surrounding

*At the time that news broke of the ,

'-gircles, no one except myself and the
E+ itnesses were aware of the fact that at "

on 25 June a UFO had been seen

reported to me on 26 June by Wayne
Lewis who, along with his brother Ricky
.and three friends, had seen what they
described as ayellowy white light moving
in the direction of Clapham, which is but a
short distance from Patching.

For. approximately ten minutes the.
object hovered over Clapham: Wood
where the light became more intense and
began pulsating. After this It took off at a
reasonbly high speed and was lost from
sight within a matter of seconds.

Although there were no UFO sightings
on the actual evening that the circles
appeared ~ at least as far as Lam aware- It .

'is interesting to. note that there .does
always seem to be a: UFO sighting
reported within a few days, anid at the
most a week, before the circles appear.

The very same weekend five circles,
similar in dimension to those at Patching, "
appeared in a wheatfiold alongside the B
3093-at Bratton, Wiltshire. This is not the
first time that such circles have appeared
in this area. In July 1983 their appearance
made the national news mainly because
of Bratton's close proximity to Warmins-
ter, which became famous in the mid
1960s for the number of UFO sightings

_and reported landings.

Throughout .. July: 1985. the circles

appeared in Hampshire and Wiltshire. In

"by five witnesses. The sighting was . Hampshire one Alresford farmer Jost
