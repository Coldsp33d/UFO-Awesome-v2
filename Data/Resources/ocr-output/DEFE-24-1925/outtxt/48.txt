crops for the sixth year running asaresult
of the mysterious circles. Once again the

~ dimensions were the same as in the other

reas and just days before they appeared
local police were involved in checking
out a UFO report. . .... -

A brilliantly lit ciroutar object was seen
hovering ." over .. Stockbridge .. Down,
Hampshite by Jack and Pat Coltins whilst
driving home one night. Mrs Collins said
't looked. like a: big. funfair. wheel
hovering in the sky'. The object was not
visible for very long as the road along
which the couple ware travelling was tree
fired and the object was therefore
blotted out by the trees. They made no
attempt to stop for a better look but on:
reaching. home telephoned the police,
who searched the area but found nothing.

Although the object was not visible for
very long, perhaps five: minutes at the
most,. Mr Collins. was able to make a

sketch, which perhaps provides the first -

clue as to what might be responsible for
the circles. According -to Mr Collins, the
outer perimeter appeared to be a con-
tinuous ring: of: light, whilst the spokes

 

 

 

 

and . the- four quarters - consisted . of
numerous individual lights, the lights of
the spokes being considerably brighter
than the others.

Neat pattem -

If an object such as that described
above were to land and the underside of
the craft, with it's spoke like construction,
were to rotate as it did so or once it had
landed, then: it. would almost certainly
produce: the: neat pattern of flattened
crop which is a feature of these circles. Of
course attached to this: large circular
object there would have to be four
smailer ones which must also rotate in the
same way. Again from the neat way in
which the crop is flattened. within the
smaller circles they would have to have
the same construction.

Mr and Mre Collins did not see anything
attached to the large circular object they
observed hovering over the countryside.
However, if we accept the fact that a UFO
was responsible for the circles - and by
UFO, I mean an aerial object which has so
far defied identification and not neces-
