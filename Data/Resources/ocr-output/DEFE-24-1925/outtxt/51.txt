I am writing in relation to.an article/s which we have just recently
researched in the October, 1954 edition of the London Dispatch (Sunday) .>

THE . ARPICLE:

"Radar installions in Great Britain had repeatedly picked up whole
f~rmations 6f unidentified flying objects during september 1954, |
some nf them passing overhead at low altitude. Military Personnel
scrambled outside their offices to take a look and were much puzzled
to find the skies clear and empty. Every time, they have followed the
same pattern, always around Mid-day, All our radar sets in the area
have picked them up. Some of the public individuals involved with
Flying Saucer research/reports at that time, were told that Flying
Seucers are normally invisible to us". a

we are very interested in these official statements; could you please
confirm these comments, especially as the radar installions now in
operation, such as Fylingdeles {which can track an object the size of a
tea tray above Moscow] are far more technologically advanced, then of
those in the 1950's? As a research organisation, we have numerous reports
"nf. UFOs, surely in range of civil and military radar never being seen as a
physical structure throughout the entire observation (one 'second visible,
the next completely invisible}. There does appear to be some evidence to
substanciate many of the claims made by the War Office in 1954.
