SHEET 2 of 2

You perhaps remember this organisation asking for a copy of a purported
study carried out by Air Marshall's Massey and Goddard concerning UFOs,
this paper was first apparent in 1955. Your information was limited but
extremely helpful. However, a further statement was made by Sir Victor
Goddard, Royal Air Force, Air Marshall in May 1969. Goddard makes several
references to psychic phenomenon and possible influence on mankind. This
is the first time I can recall such a statement being made by the military
(U.K.) in relation to unidentified flying objects? Do you feel that this
factor is or could be connected with the public, and indeed the military
reporting of UFO's? There does appear to have been an increase in the
governmental (worldwide) interest in and "E.S.P.", have the MoD any
research or perhaps conclusions regarding this avenue of research. Perhaps
in your files there does exist cases whereby the previously mentioned
phenomenon is regarded as a prime solution. If so, we would be grateful
for this documentation, perhaps 1969 onwards, would be a starting point'!

Thank you again for your valuable time, we believe a greater liaison
between your department could provide an insight into the subject. I look
forward to your comments and the August/September UFO sightings I requested
in December 1985.
