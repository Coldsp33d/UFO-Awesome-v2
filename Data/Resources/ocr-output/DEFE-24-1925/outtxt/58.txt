SHEET THO

sources your office received numerous reports of unidentified flying
objects, I request this documentation for research purposes and

possible publication.

If a charge is made for search and photostat purposes, then I would be
prepared to pay.

August in particular int√©rests me, for several village people at Carleton
near Skipton, North Yorkshire, claim an unknown craft landed some two
miles Southeast of the village and military personnel at Menwith Hill who
had tracked the target found a large burnt area in the locality. Rumour,
perhaps, yet any further information'. you could supply would be
interesting. If your department would like a full report of our findings

I would be only too pleased to supply.

I must thankyou also for your co-operation concerning the forwarding of
the Public Records Office in Su rey. Pre 62 reports contain a great deal

more than the 'modern type'.
One final question; does your report form surpass the 'LETTER P'?

Once again thanks very much for your help in these matters, and I do hope
I receive the papers before July 1986!
