1. In January of 1978, I was station at McGuire AF3, N.J.. One evening , during the

time frame of Q}OOhrs. and O5OOhrs., there vere a number of UFO sightins in the area over
the air field and Ft. DIX Army carp. I am a security policeman and was» on routine patrol
at the time, N.J. State Police, and Ft. Dix MP's vore runnig code in the direction of
Brownsville,N.J.. A state trocper then entered Gate #5 at. the rear of the base requesting
assistance and permission to enter. I was dispatched and the trooper wanted access to the
runvay area which led to the very back of the air field and connected with a heavily woode -
ed area which is part of the Dix training area. He informed me that a Ft. Dix IP was
pursuing a low flying object which then hcvered over his car. He described it as oval
shaped, with no details, and glowing with a blueish green color. His radio transmission
was cut off, At that time in front of his police car, appeared a thing, about ft. tell,
greyish, brown, fat head, long arms, and slender body. The P panicked and fired five
rcunds from his .L5 Cal into the thing, and one round into the object above, Tha object
then fled straight up and joined with eleven others high in the sky. This ve all saw

but didn't know the details at the time. Anyway, The ting ran into the woods towerds our
fenceline and they wanted to look for it. By this time several patrols were involved.

2, We found the body of the thing near the runway, It had apparently climbed the fence '
and died while running, It was all of a sudden hush-hush and no one was allowed near

the srea,. We roped off the area and AF OSI came out and took over. That was the list I
saw of it. There was a bad stench coming from it too. Like ammonia smelling but it

wasn't constent in the air. That day, a team from Wright=Patterson AFB care in a "lil

and went to the area. They crated it in a wooden box, sprayed something over it, and then
put it into a bigger metal container. They loaded it in the plane and took off. That

was it, nothing more said, no report made and we vers all told not to have anything to
say about it or we would be court rartialed.

3. I will be getting out of the air force in about two months. Do Not disclose ry name.
as I could .get into trouble. I am interested in pursuing this and other catters if you
need help. Forgive me for not signing this but I can't take any chancess Please reply
to the above address and my parents will forward it to me or I will be home already.
Don't send it here because they monitor all mail closely and I again don't want to

take any chances. 6
