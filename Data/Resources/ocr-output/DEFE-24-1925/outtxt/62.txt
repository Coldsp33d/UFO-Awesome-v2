Thank you for your letters on the subject of a possible UFO
sighting in the vicinity of RAF St Mawgan in February of this year.
I am sorry that I have been unable to reply before now.

I am afraid there is little help I can give you in your
research of this alleged incident. Indeed, we have received no
reports of unusual activity in the St Mawgan area in February of this
year and the only information we have is that which you yourself have
provided. RAF St Mawgan have been consulted and they too have no
knowledge of the phenomenon and were certainly not conducting any
operation or research which might account for it.

I am grateful for the concern you express in your letters and
I agree that it is important that such incidents are reported to us
in view of the possible defence implications. However, as you will
no doubt be aware, there is no organisation in the Ministry of
Defence appointed solely for the purpose of studying reports of such
objects, and no staff are employed on the subject full time. The
reports we receive are referred to the staff in the Department who
are responsible for the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they
examine the reports as part of their normal duties, The information
you have provided has been considered in this way and we are
satisfied that there was no threat to UK security and thus that there
is no defence interest in this incident.
