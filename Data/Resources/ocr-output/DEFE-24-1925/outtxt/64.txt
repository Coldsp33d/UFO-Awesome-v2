Dear Sir/Madam, C lua

According to. my MP, the Rt Hon Merlyn Rees, your department will be able to help me in ny
research for reports. of sees Objects (urOs) from the era of the
Second World War,. + -

I would therefore like to © any iiforsatien you have on the reported sightings of
~UFOs during the Second World War.The term UFO was probably not used but we have reason to
believe that the term 'FOO FIGHTER® or simply reports of: 'UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT' were

used by both allied and German aircrews alike,.

T would also like to request any information you might have on weo reports in general,
cither before,during or after the war.

If your department does not have such information on file do you 'know of any establishment
that might, if you do I would scmeciste : it. if you could supply me with the address of this
establishment.,

I look forward to your reply, untill then I am,

  

The Yorkshire UFO Society (YUFOS).
