~ oS 12/

H --> at 12.15 am, accompanied by his dog Tiny.

' On reaching Government Road he encountered a Ministry of Defence policeman on his
beat, and after a brief chat with him headed towards his selected fishing site,
about 115 yards north of the Gasworks Bridge on Government Road. He undid his
fishing rod holdall. and took out the bottom joint of his fishing umbrella, pushed
it into the soil and tied the dog to it. While unpacking his tackle box he. heard
the gong at the Buller Barracks strike one o'clock. He set up the rod rests, cast

out his tackle and then sat down watching the water for fish movement.

The Encounter

"After about fifteen minutes," -: me, "I decided to have a cup of
tea, which I poured from my thermos. I stood up to ease my legs and was putting the
cup to my mouth when T saw a vivid.light coming towards me from the south, which
is over North Town. It wavered over the railway line and then came on again; then
settled down. The vivid light went out, though I could still see a light through
the boughs of, the week. I thought, well that can't be an aeroplane; it's too low, ,
because it was at about 300 feet." .

"During this time I had set the cup down on the tackle box and lit a cigar-
ette, and while smoking it my dog began to growl. It was then that I saw two
'forms' coming towards me, and when they were within 5 feet of me they just stopped
and locked at me, and I at them, for a good 10: or 15 seconds." Tiny, an cbedient +
dog, Had stopped growling by this time, on her master's command. <

"They were about 4 feet high, dressed in pale grein coveralls from head to
foot, and they had helmets of the same colour with a visor that was blacked out,"

- me. . "Then. the one on the right beckoned me with his right forearm
and turned away, still waving its arm. I-took it that he wished me to follow,
which T did. | He moved off and I fell in behind him, and the chap that was on the
left fell in behind me. - We walked along the towpath until we got to the railings
by the canal bridge. The 'form' in front of me went through-the railings, while >

I went over the top, and we crossed Government Road then went down on the footpath."
