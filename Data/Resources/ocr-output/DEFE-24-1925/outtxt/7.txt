Thank you for your letter in which you asked for the
Department's views on the incident at RAF Woodbridge in December
1980.

You may find it useful if I explain that the sole interest of
the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence in reported sightings of
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) is to establish whether they have
any bearing on the defence of the country.

The only information we have on the alleged "UFO sighting" at
Rendlesham Forest in December 1yb0.is the report by Colonel Charles
Hait, of the United States Air Force, We are satisfied that the
events described sre of no defence significance. I can assure you
that there is no question of attempting to cover up any incident or
mishap, mor are we attempting in any way to cbsoure the truth,

I recall you also asked when you telephoned me if I could give
you the number of reports we have had of 'signtings'. .. During 1985
the Ministry of Defence received 160 reported sightings of aerial
phenomena 'or 'UFO!'s', the majority of these being in the welsh,
Yorkshire and Thames Valley/London areas,

Up until the end of March this year we nad received 39
reports, 1 trust that this information is of some use to yeu.

Yours sincerely
