causing offence.. As to his 'rejection' , which he found mildly disappointing , he
attributes this to his bronchial and arterial problems, and thirks that the yoper
scanning device (if that is what it was)} detected the plastic replacement

op suffered none of the harmful side-effects sometimes reported by

close encounter witnesses, sath as temporary paralysis, nausea, diarrhea, skin and
eye irritation, headaches, and so on; nor is he aware of any swigsis of time lapse.
But he told me that he did feel "different" after the experience. He ate little

. for a while, resulting in some loss of weight, and felt less inclined to go out.
He found difficulty getting to sleep, due to continually turning the over if
his mind. 'But he has few regrets about his extraordinary experience, which in my
opinion ranks as one of the most convincing close encounter cases I have invest-

"Until I had this encounter with the UFO," he told me, "I always took the
talk about them with a pinch of salt, but now I know they are a fact. During the
time I -was with them I felt no fesr, only curiosity, nor were they hostile towards

- me nor I to them. | My only regret about the whole affair is that I did not have
another person along with me to see and experience something that I did not believe
in until it happened to me, and I think myself lucky that I am here today to speak
about it, for I am'sure that these men were out to abduct some person, and that

person could have been me. But atthe same time I will say that it was the greatest

experience of my life."
