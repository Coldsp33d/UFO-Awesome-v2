Rear Siz or Madam,
1 I am writing my second letter to you,after sending my first one im
i - Angust,this year. As I have not had a reply to that letter,l am writing
; to you once more. ©
previous letter,and this one concerns the same subject - that of a

My
| claimed 'U.7.0. Sighting!', observed by a member of the public during the
carly part of February this year,near to the Eoyal Air Forse Base,at

St Nawgem,in Comnvall.

f The phenomenon observed was that of an object,firstly spherical and
| orange in colous, changing to a black haze, thes with a silvery white hare.

i Ib was observed for over four minutes by a reliable witmesm, The phenomenon
| _ made no noise, However,it was observed bobbing and wearing over nearby

hedgerow,and the marrow road where it was observed.

When I first heard of this sighting,1 was at the time working im
Plymouth, Devon and visited the "sighting area' many times im order to

observed and the damage is consistent with that of being by am aerial
objéct,consistent with the estimated size of the phenomenon,given to us by
the witness. Ne have reason to beleive that the damage found,vwas caused by
this sighted phenomenon,.

Becalse you have probably received my previous letter,and also tvo: from
R.A.F. St Hawgam that I sent to them in. April/May,which they state they have
forwarded to yourmelves,1 am not going to repeat details which I have done
three times already. >

what concerns colleagues and myself,is the somewhat lax response from
both yourselves, and the Royal Air Force over this matter, The incident is
not merely a light in the aky passing over a 8.A.F. Base,but a very well
defined phenomenon less than one mile away from this strategic Bese, which
we beleive may have passed through the Sage itself,and was flying less than
ISft from ground level,and we beleive hitting some nearby hedgerow, Surely,
incidents like this need to be reported to your Department,because of a
possible Defence. riek?. '

I do understand that your Department is possibly flooded with quite

simple sightings offlights in the aky* ¥.F.0. Investigation
