«Ef mo! iga

Dear Sir,

I am enquireing about the artical in the News Of The World news-
paper about the U.F.0 landings in Suffolk England. The artical was in the
paper on October 1983. I phoned the News of The World, but they couldn't
tell me much more than what was in the paper, so I phoned the U.S.A.F base
in Suffolk where the U.F.0 was surppose to heve landed, they couldn't tell
me much because most of the people who were there at the time of the landing
had left and went back home, One of the personel said that an offical report
had gone to the M.0.D

The M.0.D don't investigate U.F.Os any more, so they said, why if that
incident was investegated hasn't the public heard any more about an incident
that took place in 19807 So why did it take the M.0.D three years to say any»
thing about it? And why did three or four of the British airmen after they
had supposedly seen and touched the Object, whire they sent back to the camp
and were tested by the N.C.O with a geiger counter and placed in isolation
until the all clear was given? Why were they also told to sign the Offical
Secrets Act, and why did some of the 'American Airmen, who were there, had their
M-16 rifes taken from them before the object landed? Why , out of all the
places that the object could have landed, it landed next to a British and
American Air base?

The object was also picked up by the near by civilien Airport radar, but
a later report said that the object was infact a beam from & lighthouse, but
redar dosn't pick up beams of light. Who ever gave that story to the news
paper reporter I'm sure he could have made up a better story than that.

I would be very grateful if you could tell me the truth behind the artical.
The only resson why I bring up the matter after so long is because a friend

only just showed me the said artical,

Yours Sincerely.
