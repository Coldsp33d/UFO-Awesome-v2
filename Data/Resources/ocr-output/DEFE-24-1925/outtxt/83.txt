Thank you for your letter of 26 July. I am sorry that I have
been unable to-reply before now.

You requested the address of the PRO and I would suggest that
you contact their Search Department at the following address:

 

Public Records Office
Ruskin Avenue

Kew

Â«Richmond. __. ___ .

You also asked for details of 3 UFO sightings earlier this
year and I enclose copies of all the information we have on these
incidents, which I hope will be of use to you.
