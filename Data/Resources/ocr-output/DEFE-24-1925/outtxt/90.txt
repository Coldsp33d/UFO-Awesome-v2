Thank you for. your letter request ing information 'on
Unidentified Fi ying Objects F943.

fod may find it useful it I explain that the sole ar
the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence in reported sightings-of UFOs
is to- establish whether they have any bearing on' the defence of. the
country. - * f

There is no orgénisation in the Ministry of Defence appointed
solely. forthe purpose of studyifig reports of such objésts, and no
are' employed on the subject full time. . The reports we receive
are referred to the staff in the Department who are responsible: for.
the (dir defence "of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports

as part of.their normal: duties. > ;

Singe our interest in UFOs: is limited to possible defence
implications we have>not carried out a study into. the scientific
significance of these phenomena. Unless there are defence

. implications we do not attempt to identify sightings and we cannot

' inform observers of the probable identity of the object seen.
Therefore, l- am afraid we do not have a great deal of information
available to send you,." However , -I attach copies of two recent
Parliamentary Questishs on the Ministry of Defence's interest in uro
reports together with a copy of the proforma we use to record
reports, which you-may 'be interested in.

I enclose details of 3 magazines which publish articles on
UFOs and the address of the British UFO Research Association. 1 am
not sure whether any-of these will be mble to help you but it might
be worth writing to them. -I am sorry that. I cannot be of more
assistance. 1
