LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT IN NORTH AND WEST YORKSHIRE

 

 

I am writing to acknowledge your letter of 2 October 1985 in which you refer to
a low flying aircraft passing over the village of Almondbury on 19 September
1985.

I have to tell you that I have no knowledge of such an aircraft movement however,
you will be aware that aircraft and helicopters regularly overfly Yorkshire at
reletively low altitude. As you may be aware there are no jet aircraft or
helicopters permanently based at RAF Leeming at present and you will therefore
understand that I have no direct control over the aircraft involved in this
incident, nor any aircraft operating in your area.

In reply to your enquiry regerding sircraft lighting I regret that I am unsble
to assist you other than to state that most aircraft carry red and green
navigation lights, red flashing anti-collision lights and, in some cases,
flashing white strobe lights.

I regret that I am unable to assist you further in this matter and would suggest,

as Royal Air Force Leeming's involvement in aviation within Yorkshire is at
present very limited, that you may wish to consider alternative avenues of

enquiry.
