near Huddresfield on the 19th of September 1985 at approx 1120m.

over various parts of Noth and West Yorkshire and Hunberside on the 22nd,23rd and 24th of
July 1984.Any information regarding the movement of aircraft/helicopters on the above dates
will be of a tremendous assistance to my enquiries,

I would also appreciate it if you could tell if there are any aircraft either
military or civilian that carry bright orange lights of any description.

Also are there any helicopters either military or civilian that display such bright white
lights that when viewed on a clear night fron a distance of around 2-3 miles that they far
out shine by 10 to 15 times the brightest astronomical body in the night sky excluding the
moon.
