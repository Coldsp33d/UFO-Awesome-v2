The documents on the House of Lords Debate on UFOs which you kindly found for the Code
request made bySection 40 have now been released to him along with some other documents
from one of our files. The Code says that when material is released, the file should be noted
accordingly. I would, therefore, be grateful if you could arrange for a note to be put on the Minute
side of the file (DIS5/108/15/1 Part 32). | suggest something along the lines of the following:

Enclosures 1/1, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 from this file were released into the public domain on 9
December 2002 following a request made under the Code of Practice on Access to Government
Information bySection 40 Names and

signatures of individuals were removed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998

Further details can be found on Directorate of Air Staff file D/DAS/64/3/11 - Part C - UFO
