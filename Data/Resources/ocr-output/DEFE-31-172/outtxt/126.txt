Following the meeting which you held with Mr Section 40
and myself on Friday 12th January the draft speech for you .
to make in response to the Earl of Clancarty's Unstarred
-_ Question on Thursday 18th January has been amended. I
. / [attach a folder containing the revised version which
follows the line which you agreed.

 

 

 

I also attach a more detailed background note, and,
. . cas you requested, the transcript of the BBC television
$ & programme on UFOs in which the Earl of Clancarty appeared
_ / and in which a Section40} - was interviewed and alleged that
she had been told by telephone to say nothing about her
'alleged sighting of a UFO. I do not suggest, unless you
particularly wish to do so, that you read the transcript;
but the parts in which you expressed an interest are on
--pages 23 and 24 Section 40 and pages 26 - 29 (Lord
Clancarty).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When we spoke on the telephone yesterday you stressed
the need for your speech to touch on Lord Clancarty's
reference to Monsieur Galley's attitude to UFOs. | This is
covered briefly in the paragraph at the bottom of page 10.
I attach, as you requested, a copy of the actual transcript

/ - of the interview with M. Galley.
