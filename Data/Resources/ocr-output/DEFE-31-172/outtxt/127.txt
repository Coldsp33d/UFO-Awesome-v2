debate on UFOs, and a Background Note; due at your office by

12 January 1979.

2. - There is a temptation to equivocate about UFOs because of

the thought that we might one day make contact with people from
distant stars. However, there is nothing to indicate that .

ufology is anything but claptrap and no svifence at all of 'alien
space craft'. The UFO industry has prospered from equivocation and,
with 1979 being heralded as 'the year of the UFOs', it seems very
proper for HMG to inject some massive common sense into the business
and come out with an equivocal attack on ufology. 'With the impact of
the film "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", and the increasing
efforts of the UFO industry and increasing publicity given to its
exponents, quite sensible people may begin to wonder whether there
might not be something in ufology, on the "whore there's smoke there's
fire" principle, Less sensible people may be increasingly confused
and perhaps even worried, to the increasing profit and encouragement
of the UFO industry, The subject will not go away, the Department
and probably Ministers are likely to find themselves increasingly
involved and under pressure for formal statements; and the popular
and UFO press are likely to make all the mileage they can out of the
Lords Debate, particularly if there are signs of equivocation or
phrases that can easily be misrepresented.

4. Accordingly it is strongly recommended that the Government take

an unequivocal and uncompromising line.
