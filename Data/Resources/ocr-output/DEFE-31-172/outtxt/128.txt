linc 5. A small difficulty has/ for purely tactical reasons

+

unconnected with UFOs, acceded (with other countries) to a

request by the Government of arsusas for a UN study group (at
Grenadan expense) to monitor information on UFOs. The wording

of that part of the draft speech has been supplied by FCO,

6. The general line adopted is that there really are strange
phenomena in the sky, but there are perfectly rational
explanations to account for them, so there is no need to introduce
the highly questionable hypothesis of alien space craft. In other
.words, Occam's Razor.

4. The broad line was put to Lord Strabolgi . at our meeting

in December and agreed by him,. Lord Strabolgi asked for further
information about cosmic distances and the difficulties of space
travel. I have not included this in the speech, because Lord
Clancarty's "sky people" are evidently "paranormal" and can cross
the light years in a trice; but some facts are included at the

"ena of the background note. I

8. | Lord Straboligi also mentioned the possibility of replying

on any detailed cases produced by Lord Clancarty if the latter will
give advance notice. I repeat the advice I gave in December: we
should not attempt to argue these cases, which tend to be remote
and elusive yet often cannot be refuted without sa detailed
examination; indeed we should not fight the battle on Lord Clancarty's
ground at all.

g. DES have been consulted and are content. j

10. You will no doubt confirm the time and place of the final
briefing, which at present we have down for am Wednesday 17 January.
