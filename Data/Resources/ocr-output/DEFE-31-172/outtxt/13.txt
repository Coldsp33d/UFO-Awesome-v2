ANNEX D

A1, The Government is not interested

in the scientific significance of

these phenomena as such. The Ministry

of Defence examines UFO reports to determine
whether they could be aircraft illegally
in UK airspace.

A2. The Government does not consider
that there is any justification for
the expenditure of public money on such
a study. j

AZ. The Ministry of Defence does not
doubt the genuineness of many people's
interest in UFOs. Its own interest,
however, is limited to the defence aspect.
It is not concerned with the scientific
significance, if any, of UFO sightings
and could not justify spending money

- voted by Parliament for defence on

matters which fall outside the defence
field. ° h '

A. The French Minister of Defence

did not say that UFOs were real. He
said that the phenomena were genuine
and reported by sensible people. At

no time did he say that they were real
in the sense of being alien space craft.

AS. - No

A6. No. The maintenance of the integrity
of UK air space requires that the Ministry
of Defence should be satisfied that any
unidentified flying object is not an
intruding aircraft. This is an
elementary precaution and one which takes
up very little staff time. No staff are
employed solely to examine UFO reports.

A7. The Ministry of Defence does hot.
investigate reports to a point at which
a positive identification can be made.
