UFOs - DEBATE IN THE LORDS

I enclose a first draft of a proposed concluding speech
for Lord Strabolgi in the Lords" debate.

2. _ The draft tries to take account of the points made to us

on Thursday by Lord Strabolgi. However, on starting to re-

read the Barl;, of Clancarty's book 'Mysterious Visitors' I

have appreciated more fully how heavily the Barl has hedged

his bets about space travel:; indeed he suggests that the 'sky
people' are 'paranormal' and come from 'another space/time
dimension'. I do not recommend trying to track the Barl through
other dimensions, and suggest we stick to the bare essentials
that we proposed to Lord Strabolgi - that there are plenty of
phenomena, that there are perfectly sensible explanations for
them, and that the explanations offered by ufology are unncessary and
prove idiotic under critical examination.

3. I would be grateful for any recent recorded cases to cover
the parts of para 6; otherwise I shall draw on the Condon Report
and Klass (the anti-UFO investigator).

4. _ Clancarty is likely to produce some 'documented'and fully
authentica cases'. I would like to be able to demolish one
as an illugion, I have provisionally chosen the disappearance
of the Norfolk Battalion at Gallipoli, which Clancartry quotes
in one of his books: HG of Army Historical Branch says that this
is a 'regular', about which the facts can be produced,

5. I would be grateful for comments, criticisms and additional
arguments or cases, At this stage I am particularly anxious to
know whether you agree to the main line of arguments. Because

time is short I would be grateful for telephone comments.

6. The present draft is about 2,000 words, around 15 minutes.

7. _ I have copied this minute to ACS(G)(RAFP), and I would be
grateful for his comments on the general line of argyment.
