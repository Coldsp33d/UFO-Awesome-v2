UNCLASSIFIED

s A ] UFOs = DRAFT CLOSING ADDRESS

There are three grains of truth upon which the great

myth of ufology is built.

FLRST: intelligent life could exist elsewhere in the
universe, With 100,000 million stars in our own
galaxy alone, it is probable that there are many

i planets capable of supporting life.

SECOND: the technical difficulties of inter-stellar

travel are stunning. Even at the speed of light

. it would take 4 years to reach the nearest star,
and 100,000 years to cross our galaxy. But it
would be a brave man who said there could never,
ever, be manned inter-stellar travel. -

THIRD: there really are strange phenomena in the skies,
and many are reported by cool sng intelligent

y * people.
2. But it is a far cry from this to the proposition that there
have been great numbers of sightings of UFOs - implying alien space
craft a sometimes claimed as running into hundreds of thousands.
Her Majesty's Government is not in the least impressed with the
idea that thore, is anything worth investigating in the information
offered by ufologists.
3Â« On the one hand, there are perfectly explanations
for the phenomena; on the other, the explanations offered by
ufologists are most unconvincing. These explanations sre un~

convincing when they relate to space craft from other stars: they

'\ are even more unconvincing when they claim that UFOs come from

another space-time dimension , from a hole in the earth, or the

depths of the sea, as Lord Clancarty has suggested.
