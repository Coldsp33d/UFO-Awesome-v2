4. - Let us first consider the phenomena. There have always
been strange things to see in the sky, and strange explanations

'have been given. Since World War II we have seen development

of powerful rockets, and voyages to the Moon and planets. We

have also seen the development of science fiction, where space

ss can be switched to 'inter-stellar drive" and our hero can

por the 2M light years to Andromeda galaxy in a flash. We have
also seen the development of ufology and the UFO industry, which
accepts the delightful fantasies of science fiction an proven fact
and interprets the phenomena in our skies as dien space craft. Most
of the phenomena are seen unexpectedly and very briefly, and are gone
before the eye has focussed. The words 'UFO' and 'space craft' have
been firmly implanted and too readily spring to mind.

C But what are the real causes of the phenomena?

&. Some have always occurred: tricks of light on cloud; comets,
meteors or showers of meteors; meteorites; bright planets P
or even the moon or stars in unusual atmospheric conditions.
Venus is popular: there are recorded cases of pilots

reporting Venus as an funidentified flying object following
them'.

p. Meteorological balloons. The Net Office alone release 50
a day, which expand to 40 foot diameter and rise to 100,000
feet and can be lit by the sun well after dark. e other
'organisations use balloons, some are much larger, and there
are recorded cases of balloons being reported as UFOs by

airline pilots.
