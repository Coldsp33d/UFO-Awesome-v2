 

@. Meteorological searchlights shine on clouds: you cannot

 

see the beam, only a light apparently dancing in the
sky.

A. A surprising number of reports relate to aircraft seen in

~- ' unusual conditions at unusual angles, some very high, some
at low level. One recent was confidently reported
on local.radio: we cannct prove that it was not a 'UFO', but
ve do know that an RAF Vulcan bomber on & low flying mission

| passed the same spot at the same time and on the same course

as the reported UFO.

 

A g. And satellites: there are some 5000 listed objects in orbit,
satellites and space debris. - More are added each year, and

U

| about 600 re-enter the atmosphere every year. Early this
i .

year MOD received many reports of a large pflce of debris

e across the South of England: most reports

Â° _jwere factual, but one spoke of an 'oval shaped thing with a
t | white cockpit which hovered for a while than shot off at
A great speed'. We cannot prove it wasn't a UFO, but it
occurred at the same time and place as some known re-entry
of space debris.
Is And of course there are optical illusions. Any phenomena
seen through glass are particularly suspect.
. 8. There are also genuine hallucinations, sometimes bn people
under stress; the excited tales of the gullible; the embellishments
of the born story teller. Also, I fear, downright lies. There

are also hoaxes: there are some very effective aerial hoaxes which

have been perpetrated by children - which I will not describe for

fear of precipitating a new rash of UFO reports.
