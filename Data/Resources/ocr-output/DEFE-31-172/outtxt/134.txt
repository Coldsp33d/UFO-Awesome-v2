called sightings were not UFOs. But we can say that there is a
great variety of phenomena in the skies for which there are f

. perfectly ordinary explanations, We have o reason to believe
that the so-called UFOs are attributed to anything but these same
causes. o - I

10. But what of these famous arrivals of UFOs, claimed to be
fully documented and authenticated by many witnesses., On
scrutiny they tend to be elusive,. I will select one, which
Lord Clancarty has described in his book Mysterious Visitors

as 'one of the most remarkable and unexplained nysteries of
modern times', He claims that during the galiipoia campaign
in 1975, an entire British regiment, the First Fourth Norfolks,
was advancing towards Hill 60: a cloud descended and picked up
the regiment and it was never heard of again ....... (checking
with Army Historical Branch)

11. As I have indicated, there is no orfficten of those who
accurately report phenomena. The criticism is of over=readiness
to call them 'UFOs*, and to transpose that into 'alien space
_oraft'. The reports are passed without critical sorutiny to
the ufologiste; who ea" without oritical. scrutiny, to their
huge files of 'reported sightings and. landings'.
