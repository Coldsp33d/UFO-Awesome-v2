12. | I am sure no-one will deny that - at the least - there are

possible rational explanations for the phenomena. Let us now
look at the other side of the coin, the range of explanations

'offered by Lord Clancarty and other ufologists - it is a wide

and confusing range, for there are as many different explanations
as there are ufologists.

13. Lord Clancarty has been reported as claiming there have been
some 80,000 sightings. Other ufologists would put the figure even
higher, Now, there is a strange thing about these huge numbers.
To put it in simple terms: either these 'space people' prefer to

keep out of the way, or they don't. If they prefer to keep out

of the way, we must assume that the number of 'sightings' is a tiny,
proportion of the actual UFO 'sorties', which must run into
millions, If they don't one would expect some unmistakable
appearances.

14. But let us look at their strange track record:

&. Not a single artefact has been produced - not a single
extra-terrestial chip has dropped an extra-terrestial
spanner, no bent pieces, no prange from perhaps millions
of sorties, no nothing,. Lord Clancarty has an answer;:
the. CIA has hidden them all.

b. There is no correlative evidence on radar of this huge

number of movements.

(. There has been no radio contact {far easier than space

travel) and no evidence on radio.

F A There have been no convincing photographs, in these days

when so many people carry cameras.
