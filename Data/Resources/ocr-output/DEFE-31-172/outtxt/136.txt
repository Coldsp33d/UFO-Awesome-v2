knowledge of UFOs by Governments. Lord Clancarty has an
answer: there is a great inter-Governmental conspiracy of

silence, initiated by the CIA.

15. The idea of the inter-Governmental conspiracy of silence

is at once the most astonishing and the most flattering claim

of all. On so few things can the Governmentsof the world agree
unaminously, but they have all supposedly agreed to conceal the
evidence of UFOs from their peoples. Let me assure this House
that Her Majesty's Government has never been approached by
people from outer space,

16. There'is no internal consistency about the idea of this huge
number of sightings. If they have come from another solar system,
what is the point of this huge number of visits to our planet,

to no apparent purpose? At best it seems wasteful. This was
once explained by the claim that aliens had advance bases the
other side of the moon. When that became untenable the bases
'¥e¥e assumed to be on another planet in our solar system,. As
that has become untenable ever more fantastic explanations are
advanced, In a recent TV broadcast Lord Clencarty claimed that
the UFOs are based in a great hole in the earth. Elsewhere he
has claimed that they have bases in remote parts of South America,
or in the depths of the oceans. Because these physical places
have become untenable he has claime{ that (I quote): 'UFOs aro
- paranormal, that is from invisible universes'. They come from
'other space-time continua', Another ufologist talks of 'space
mind/Mana'. Indeed the explanations get more and mors
'faentastic, and more and more incapable of ether proof or dis-

proof.
