British Citizens: Overseas Supplements

Lord Istch of Lushy: My Lords, I beg leave to ask
the first Question which stands in my name on the
Order Paper.

'The Question was as follows:

To ask Her Majesty's Government how many
British citizens received British Expatriates Supple-
mentation Scheme or Overseas Service Aid Scheme
supplements in 1979 and in 1981 and what further
changes are planned.

The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign
aud Commonwealth Office (Lord Trefgamc): My
Lords, the average number of British citizens receiving
h Expatriates Supplementation Scheme or Over-
ice. Aid Scheme supplements in 1979 was
4,083. 'In 1981, the comparable figure was 2,975.
The numbers have fallen steadity since 1970 and
reductions are expected to continue at about 10 per

cent, per annum over the next few years. | No changes ©

in terms of service are planned at the moment.

Lord Hatch of Lusby: My Lords, may I ask the noble
Lord the Minister whether he has read the Answer
given by liis colleague to a similar Question which 1
put in December? The Answer, which I paraphrase,
was that the numbers Rad fallen because local indi-
genous people had now become sufficiently trained to
take those positions, If the noble Lord has looked
since at these figures, would he agree that this is not
an adequate nnswor and that this is a deliberate policy
by the Government to reduce the number of British
citizens who are given supplements to work overseas?
Would the noble Lord further agree that this is causing
very great difficulty to universitics, to technical colleges
and to a whole range of national activities in the
Commonieaith ? +

 

 

 

© Lard Trefgare: No, I do not agree h that, my
Lords, 1 have indeed studied the Answer which my
noble friend Lord Skelmersdale gave to the noble
Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, at the end of last year.
The reasons which my noble friend then gave remain
correct.

 

Lord Hatch of I : But surely the figures which
have been given this afternoon, if 1 heard corre

Lord Trefgame; My Lords, the numbers have indeed
declined, as I described in the original Answer and as
was referred to at the time of the carlier Question at
the end of last year, | But one has to remember that
these schemes are operated in the closest consultation
with the various Governments concerned, and they
sometimes choose to use the aid funds for other
purposes.

Unidentified Flying Objects:; Sightings

3.4 pm.

The Earl of Clnearty; My Lords, I beg leave to
ask the Question which stands in my name on the
Order Paper.

The Question was as follows:

'To ask Her Majesty's Government how many
reports have been reccived by the Ministry of
Defence on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in
each of the last four years, and what action has been
taken in cach case.

Viscount Long: My Lords, in 1978 there were 750
sightings; in 1979 there were 550 sightings; in 1980,
gs; and in 1981, 600 sightings. All UFO
reports are passed to operations staff who examine
them solely for possible defence implications.

 

   

The Ear) of Clancarty: My Lords, while thanking
the noble Viscount for that Answer, may I ask him
whether or not it is a fact that over 2,000 authenticated
UFO reports were published last year in the national
press? . If so, were they accopted or passed on to the
Ministry of Defence? And what happened to them?

 
 

 

Viscount Long: My Lords, they did mot all get to
the Ministry of Defence. ] have just informed your
Lordships of the numbers sighted. - If the noble Earl
is suspicious that the Ministry of Defence is covering
up in any way, T can assure him that there is no reason
why we should cover up the figures which he has
mentioned if they are true. - The sols intorest of (
Ministry of Defence in UFO reports is to establish
whether they reveal anything of defence interest-for
example. a Russian aireraft or an unidentified aireratt
-which might have breached our security systc

 

  

 
 
 
  

 

Lord Wynne-Jones: My Lords, does the Answer
given mean that since there has been a Conservative
Government the UFOs have done a U-turn and
departed ?

Viscount Long: Not according to my reading, my
Lords.
