My Lords, I do not have those
snppeared into the unknown before

I~~1 Strabolgit My Lords, may I ask the noble
Vis Lt whether the present Government adhere to
the view of the previous Government whi
forward when I replied to the debate three
in your Lordships® House, that most of these so-called.
sightings can be accounted for as natural phenomena?

  

Viscount Long: Yes, my Lords, they can be. Many
of them are ficcounted for in one way or another,
but nobody has got a really constructive answer for
all of them.

Lord Hill-Norton: My Lords, may 1 ask the noble
Viscount whether or not it is trig that all the sighting
reports received by the Ministry of Defence before
1962 were destroyed because they were, detned " to"
be of no interest"? And if it is truc, who was it
who decided that they were of no interest?

 

Viscount Long: My Lords, my reply to the noble
and gallant Lord-1 was wondering whether he was
going to say that the Royal Navy had many times seen
the Loch Ness monsler-is that since 1967 all UFO
Before that time, they
were generally destroyed after five years.

Lord Paget of Northampton: My Lords, can the noble
Viscount tell us whether, out of these thousands of
sightings which he m iod, there Tins been a
siugle one which suggested any menace to our defences?
In the circumstances, is not an awful lot of time being
wasted on this nonsense?

 

 

Viscount Long: My Lords, T think Her Majesty's
Government are waiting for an invitation from them
to discuss these problems,

Mr. Anatoly Shcharansky:; Representations

3.9 p.m.
Lord Renton: My Lords, I beg nl to ask the

Question which stands in my name on the Order
Paper.

The Question was as follows:

~ 'To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they
are aware that Anatoly Shcharansky has for the past
15 months been undernourished, tortured. and
frequently placed in punishment cells, and in October
1981 had his prison sentence increased by 3 years
for his refusal'to plead guilty to a charge of which
he has always maintained his innocence; and whether
they will request the Soviet Government to state
whether they i d to keep him in those uncivilised
conditions until he relents or digs.

 

 

Lord Trefgamne: My Lords, Her Majesty's Govern-
ment remain gravely concerned about the plight of
Anatoly Shcharansky and are disturbed by recent
reports of his ill- nent. . We have raised this case

' with the Soviet quthorities on many occasions, both

in direct bilateral contact and at the Maudr
meting: . We shall continue to take a close interest
in Mr, Shcharansky's case, and to make representations
as suitable opporturiities arise,

 

Lord Renton: My Lords, may I thank my noble
friend not only for -that Answer but for the action
ich he and. the Foreign Office have been and are
taking with regard to Shcharansky's plight? May I
ask my nobl nd whether or not the Sovict Govern-
ment's failure, as shown by the treatment of Shcharan-
sky and others, to honour their Helsinki undertakings
diminishes their credibility in relation to all other
matters in which they say they are secking a o
and on which they would like to be believed ?

 

 

 

 

  

Lord Trefgarne: If I may say so, my Lords, my
noble friend has put his finger on the nub of the pro-
blem, . How can we believe what they say in negotia-
tions such as the IMF negotiations, the MDFR
negotiations as they are called in Viemia, or in any
other forem for that matter, when they do not do
what they said they would do at Helsinki in 19767

Lord Shimwell: My Lords, in view of the rumours,
which are probably well founded, that Mr. Brezhnev
is about to retire, could a message from your Lord-
ships' House be sent to him through the Sovict Embassy
wishing him for the remainder of his lifc-and we hope
he has many years loft yet-peace and contentment
and asking whether, as a gracious act upon his retire»
ment, he will ensure that Mr. Shcharansky is treated as
at civiiised person?

 

 

Locd Trefgarne; | My Lords, T would certainly be will-
ing to send another message to the Soviet Union about
Mr Shcharansky if I thought it would have any effect.
As to the future of Mr. Brezhnev, T believe that that is
a matter for them to decide for themselves.

Viscomit Mowntgaeret: My Lords, would it not help
if the western nations ceased providing wheat to the
Soviet Union, at a time when they are finding them-
selves short, until they cease to carry out such inhuman.
activities against individuals and sovercign States?

Lord Trefgame: My Lords, the failure of the Soviet
agricultural industry is now plain for all to se, but I
am not sure that the interests of the West are served

. by starving them out. >

Lord Ehiyn-Jones: My Lords, in view of the fuct
that the treatment of Shcharansky scoms to be a
serious violation of human rights, has the matter
besn raised before the sub-commission on human '
rights at the United Nations?

Lord Trefgarie; My Lords, E am not certain that
the matter has been raised ore that pa
but certainly it has been raised before ail the others [
mentioned. There could be a good opportunity, for
doing as the noble and learned Lord suggests.

   

Lord Avebury: My Lords, is tne Minister nware that

 

Mr. Shcharansky is a very distinguished computer
Will he therefore consider a reduction in
