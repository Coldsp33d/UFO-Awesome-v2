UFO Sighting Reports: Security Th

The Earl of Cork ard Orrery: My Lords, I beg leave
to ask the Question which stands in my name on the
Order Paper.

The Question was as follows:

To ask Her Majesty's Government how many of
the 2,250 sightings of UFOs reported to the Ministry
of Defence in the years 1978-81 wore, and still are,
classified for reasons of security.

Viscount Lo

 

None, my Lords.

The Earl of Cork and Orrery: My Lords, 1 thank my
noble kinsman for that Answer. . May I ask him two
questions?. First, what did he mean when he said in
his Answer on, T thirk, dth March that reports of

 

sightings that were considered to be of interest to-

defence were in fact classified? Secondly, what pro-
cedures may be open to individnals or organis
who would like to see the reports?

 

Viscount Leng: My Lords, with regard to the latter
part of my noble friend's supplementary question, there
is no reason why he should not come and see the reports.
Not mary of thein come in because not many people
actually report sightings. . 'There is no cover up in that
respect. <As for the first part of my noble friend's
supplementary question, 1 stick to what 1 said earlier.

The Earl of Kimherfey: My Lords, can my noble
friend say why,. when 1 previously asked a supple-
mentary question, he said that the figures had got lost
on the way to the Mini
they are there and available for anyone to see? Can
he therefore place them in the Library for all of us
to see?

 

  

Viscount Long: My Lords, I will look into that and
find out whether it is possible for your Lordships to
see them. I should like all of your Lordships to see

'them in the Library, if possible.

* Lord Steabolgit My Lords, may I ask the Govern-
ment whether they think that any of these UFOs are
manned spacecraft coming from a planet outside the

solar system, as is believed by the " ufologists "?

  

 

Viscount Long: My Lords, the noble Lord can
believe that; anything is possible.

deliberitely-that all the information is well-known
to the Ministry of Defence, but that for diplomatic
and other reasons it is not prepared to make an
announcement ?

Viscount Long: No, my Lords, it is not prepared 10
make an announcement because it has not got the facts
to make an announcement with authority behind it.

 

Lord Beswick: My Lords, the Question asks about
2,250 sigh The noble Viscount that.there are
very few sightings reported to the Ministry of Defence.
Does that mean to say that the figure in the Question is
incorrect?

 
 

 

 

Viscount Long: No, my Lords, it was on the originat
assumption. that there arc probably. many sightings
that are not reported to the Ministry of Defence, - That
is what T was really referring to. Therefore, at this
stage what we have said is that we have gat.

Lord Beswick: My Lords, I should like to cléar up
that point, The Question refers to 2,250 sightings

"* reported " to the Ministry of Defence, - The Question
1 was asked was, "* Is that figure correct, or not?"

 

Viscount Cong: That is correct, my Lords, up to this
moment. .

Lord Wade: My Lords, may T ask which Ministry is
responsible for UFOs?

 

Viscount Long: None, my Lords, Reports come into
the Ministry of Defence, and anjone can tuke them
from there,

Viscount St. Davids: My Lords, has anybody yet
found an empty beer can marked, " Made in
Centaurus ", or any similar object? | Until they have,
will the Ministry deal with these matters with very
considerable scepticism, please?

Viscount Long: My Lords, I am not the Minister for
conservation, if it is a question of beer cans.

Lord Morris: My Lords, if something is said to be
unidentified, how can it possibly be said to exist ?

Viscount Long: A very good question, my Lords.
Lord Leatherland: My Lords. can the Minister tell us

whether any of the unidentified flying objects are
Ministers who are fleeing from the Cabinet just now?

 

  

Viscount Long: No, my Lords.

The Earl of Clancarty: My Lords, may I ask the noble
