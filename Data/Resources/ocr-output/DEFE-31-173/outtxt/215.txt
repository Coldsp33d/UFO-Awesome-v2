'Dear Sirs,

M On the evening of Wednesday the 11th. inst., I, together
with my two neighbours observed an object at a very great height.
D0 It shone with the magnitude of Venus at it's brightest.

We observed it through binoculars.

i It did not move for a period of about half an hour.

' From our viewpoint it was at approximately 60Â° and in an estimated
N.Y. direction.

' It appeared to have circular form. R

I first noticed it at about 9.15 (21.15) and observed it until
about 21.45 at which time I went indoors to fetch my x25 telescope.

However, upon finding the 'scope I was disappointed to find that

j the: object had disappeared.

I had however fixed it's position by aligning it with the corner
of the roof.

The time was then almost 22.00. ,

Upon making a further aligned viewing I found I. was looking at
&. point approximately in the centre of the "Plough" which was by
then faintly visible.

My.neighbours would corroborate.
P Your's Faithfully, -
