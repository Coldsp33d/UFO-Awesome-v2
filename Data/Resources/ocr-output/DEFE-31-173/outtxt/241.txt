my friend out to show her. We both stood and watched for about 5-10
minutes. I ron out to tell my neighbours but saw two young boys walking
by and asked them if they could see it they said they could. I ran -
back into my friend, we watched a little longer. I then ran next door
and told them, we went in their garden. They also saw it ond the light
flashing off it. I ran back in agoin and my friend and I stood watshing
it when a blinding white ball with a trail behind went above from left

to right, we both screamed at the same time our neighbours heard us.

The light at this time was going further back in the sky and throughout
the whole time the object was moving very fast and very erratic the
whole time. I am not a nutter. I 'phoned the police who sent three
officers round, who all witnessed and agreed this was not a plane or a
star ond that it was flashing colours and moving very erratic. | This
object was also viewed through bincculars.by the police and myself".
