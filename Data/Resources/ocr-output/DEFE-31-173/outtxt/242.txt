Mi ss{Section 40} stated "My friend called me into her back garden at 9.45pm
and we both saw a large flashing object, much larger than a star in the
sky between two trees. The object was flashing bright pink, blue and
white and small white objects were shooting away from the main object
while it moved in a triangular motion. | We watched it for 55 minutes and.
in this time it faded almost away and then came back and started to fade
slowly, - After watching for about 20 minutes a bright white light
flashed rapidly past us about 100 feet from the house from left to right
leaving a bright white trail.

 

I saw one white object go back to the main red, white and blue one after
about 20 minutes."

Air Traffic Control informed. - OB 168 and SM 63A of 26.4.84. and
SM 3 of 27.4.84. refer.
