1. On Monday 5 Aug 1985 Mr Section 40 GOODWORTH, CLATFORD
who farms near the AAC Centre, Middle Wallop telephoned to report some
extraordinary depressions in a Tield of near ripe wheat, and asked, "What on
earth we (THE AAC) were up to now?" I took the Afreraft Actident Investigation
Officer (AIFSO) Maj Section AEME with me and went to inspect the scene.

&. The site, Grid Reference 346392 was a vergin, un-weather damaged, near ripe
field of wheat. We found the following:

a. An exactly circular hole in the wheat in which the wheat had been
laid flat in a clockwise twist 40 ft in diameter. (As if a plank had
been put with one end at the centre and then swept round in a compléte
circle). There were one or two stalks of wheat standing which had sprung
upright again. The wheat on the edge of the circle was completely upright
and undamaged.

6. Four separate, smaller circles approx twelve feet in diameter, exactly
similar to the larger one. These were set in a precise square, NORTH/SOUTH
and EAST/WEST, with their centres 43 paces from the centre of the large circle.
%. There were absolutely no tracks in the wheat. To have set the holes

in such a precise pattern manually would have required a tape measure or
string, and the users would have been bound to leave tratks in the wheat.

CB All but one of the holes touched onto the main furrows in the wheat,
'and could therefore be approached from the edge of the field without leaving
tracks. However there was no way of moving from-one to the other without

leaving tracks in the wheat, except by going some 200 yards to the edge of
the field, and then back down another main furrow, One of the smaller
holes was completely isolated.

3. Maj SeCtiON «bok some polaroid photographs which are included with this

report . Mr Section A0 semi professional photographer, took some 120mm colour
photographs. I subsequently took Mr Sectionatid we photographed the scene from

the air. By that time some half a dozen sight-seers were on the scene and a track,
which had not been there when we were on the ground, had been made out to the
isolated hole.

4, Present at the initial viewing were:
Lt 'Col Section 40 APC AAC

Maj I Section REME

Mr & Section 40
Mr Section 40
And two others

None of us could offer any reasonable explanation.
