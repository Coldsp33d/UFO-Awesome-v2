is In Reference A, you notified us of the meeting between US of S(AF) and
Lord Hill-Norton on Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) on 25 Sept 85; you
asked for a short contribution on our area of interest and whether we would be
willing to attend the meeting.

2. As you state in your brief for the US of S(AF), all UFO reports are
passed to the DIS - specifically DISS who, inter alia, are responsible for
assessing WP space systems. It is in this area that our main interests lie,
although the reports are also seen by other staff within DISS. Obiously we
read the reports with interest, but over, at least the last few years, we have
not considered that any of the reports justified detailed investigation; this
point is well made in the opening paragraph of your draft.

3. As far as our attendance at the meeting on 25 September is concerned, I
do not think that we can add much to the discussion but we would be willing to
attend if you consider it worthwhile.
