The Lord Trefgarne,;= '~
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State

for the Armed Forces,
House of Lords, f
London, SW1,

hao Dawek,.

Thank you for your letter of 17th July about our corres-
pondence on the UFO question. I would greatly welcome an off- the-
record talk with you, Parliament rises on Tuesday, but I would be
delighted to come up to London at any mutually convenient date
during August when you have had time to consider this letter and to
take any further briefing from officials which you think might be
useful. (Perhaps your office would care to be in touch with me by
telephone at my home address Tel: Section 40

It may be helpful if I list the questions which I, at any
rate, would like to explore. 1 know you will understand that I do
not ask them frivolously or without a geod deal of careful thought
about the evidence .- or supposed evidence - which appears to exist
for a persistent phenomenon which, as I see it at present, cannot
be wholly without Defence significance. I need hardly add that if
there ware ser tive Defence auestions at issue, I would be the last
to press them in public. I

 

The ground which I hepe we might cever in an informal
discussion is indicated by the following questions:

a. Doss the Ministry of Defence acknowledge - by way of reports
from the public, the civil police, the Civil Aviation
Authority, other civil authorities or its own establish-
ments - that traces are obtained from time to time of the
intrusion into British airspace (and sometimes territory)
of phenomena for which no prosaic explanation can be given?
(1 should add that although I am always willing to be dis-
usded, the evidence accumulated by civilian researchers for
the persistence of some such phenomena - amounting on
occasion to apparently structured 'vehicles' - seems to me
at present overwhelming. I shall be glad to give you
instances. The events reported by Lt. Col. Gactiongh the
United States Air Force in a r√©port to your Department
dated 13th January 1981 are among them)
