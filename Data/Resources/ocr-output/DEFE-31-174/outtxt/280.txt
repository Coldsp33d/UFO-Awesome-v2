Bran Boavek,

Thank you for your letter of 17th July about our corres
pondence on the UFO question. I would greatly welcome an off- t}
record telk with you. Parliament rises on Tuesday, but I would be

Authority, other civil authorities or its own establish-
ments - that traces are obtained from time to time of the
intrusion into British airspace {and sometimes territory)
of phenomena for which no prosaic explanation can be given?
(I should add that although I am always willing to be dis-
uaded, the evidence accumulated by civilian researchers for
the persistence of some such phenomena - amounting on
occasion to apparently structured 'vehicles' - seems to me
at present overwhelming, I shall be glad to give you
instances. The events reported by Lt. Col, Halt of the
United States Air Force in a report to your Department
dated 12th January 1981 are among them).
