Dear Sir,

Report of Unidentified Flying Object

Please find enclosed UFO report --- Reps
This report was initially relayed to ATC Dunsfold by @@
fiancee who is a employee at Dunsfold. It was not

passed by telephone to Military as I considered the time delay from
observation to receipt of the report at Dunsfold would not constitute an
"immediate' report.

The Dunsfold radar controller on duty at the time of the reported
observation does not recall sesing anything unusual on radar in the
vicinity of Horsham at the appropriate time,
