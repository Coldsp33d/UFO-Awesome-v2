15.785, 4.06 pm - 4.10 po.

Spherical, approx 30-40 feet diameter, with appearance of highly
polished silver metal, with a protruding lip } of the way from

the bottom, this being mid grey in colour. | The lower surface of
this lip seemed to have a flat surface on the horizontal axis of the
sphere, the upper surface of the lip seemed concave and faired in.
The object emitted a throbbing double-beat sound somewhat akin to a
ship's propeller. - The object became silent before it was out of the
audio range one would expect, as if the sound source had stopped.

 

Section 40
Horsham,
W. Sussex.

The object was seen from both indoors and outdoors, in a direction
from the house of approx 330 through 260 , - I was stationary on
foot.

The sighting was entirely by naked eye.

The direction in which the object was first seen was approx 330° from
the house. - No landmarks available.

Very approx 30°.
Approx $ mile, no landmarks of use in this respect.

The object moved in an arc from 330° to 260° (from observers position)
increasing distance from the observer through this arc, and coming

back towards the observers position, towards the end of the arc, visual
contact was lost at this point, the object seemed to maintain a constant
altitude.

There was a white overcast sky behind the object at all times but
visibility was very good and at no time was there any cloud or mist
between object and observer.

. The only nearby site of the types specified is the airport at Gatwick.
