Dear Sirs,

1 am writing to confirm the information I gave by telephone
to the Duty Officer, RAF Operations, at approximately Q110 on Saturday 25 May 1985.

1 reported that during a visit to friends at Cowley Hill,
a little north of Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, 1 had seen - at some time between
2100 and 2130 hours on Friday 24 May 1985 - a triangular array of lights in the
direction of Elstree. They appeared to form an equilateral triangle of white to
yellow lights, self-illuminated, with the base parallel to the horizon, at an ele-
vation of 30 to 40 degrees. I reported the azimuth as being about South East, but
telephoned the Operations Room again at about 1730 on Saturday 25 May Â©9385 to say
that this was clearly in error:; the azimuth was certainly South West rather than
South East.

 

 

I heard no sound and detected no movement in this array of
lights. It appeared to be stationary in the sky below cloud cover which [ estimated
at about 10/]O0ths stratus. The sighting lasted for about 2 minutes, suggesting to
me that ] was not observing an aircraft in (for example) the Heath Row circuit.

  

1 can make no estimate of distance. But the angular dim-
ensions of the object were (approximately):~

a. About one sixth of the diameter of the moon for each of the
three lights (viz. five or six minutes of arc).

About five or six diameters between each of the three lights,
viz. each side of the equilateral triangle must have been of
the order of 40 or more minutes of arc.

As a former member of the British Astronomical Association
(which I only recently relinge d on moving to London, where telescopic observa-
tion is impossible) and as an ex-RAF navigator, I rather doubt that I am easily
deceived by aerial phenomena. distinct impression is that 1 perceived an event
for which no rady explanation is possible in wholly conventional terms. Astronomical
phenomena are, I think, ruled out by the extensive cloud cover as well as by the
very regular, triangular formation of the three lights seen. And aircraft lights
seem a very-unlikely explanation.

 

 

In view of the impossibility of estimating a precise dist-
ance for the sighting, I was not able to answer the questions put to me by the
Operations Room and again by the Duty Desk at the MOD Main Building, Whitehall,
about whether the sighting was near to high-power voltage lines, bodies of still
water or a local town. There is a reservoir near Elstree; high-voltage lines are
endemic in Hertfordshire; and the county abounds in towns, But I can give you only
the angular dimensions of the object(s) seen; and the precise distance must remain
