I would like to add that I was greatly heartened, as an ex-MOD official,
to discover that serious attention is being paid to events in British airspace, not
only by the Duty Desk in Whitehall but also by yourseives. [ am most grateful for
the courtesy with which my report was received. I am, of course, well aware that
the Flying Complaints Flight has the thankless task of responding to members of the
public who feel, rightly or wrongly (and perhaps often wrongly !) that uncovenanted
military flying has taken place in their local areas. I would like to stress that
1 am most certainly not making a complaint. I merely hope that my own observation
has contributed to your surveillance.

I would, of course, be most interested to know (within whatever limits
of security you must observe) what interpretation is placed upon my report and
what expert evaluation of it has been made of it by other authorities beyond your

own unit.

Yours sincerely,

PS:; A quick call by you to Civilian Management at the MOD would confirm that I
served in the MOD from 1949 to 1977, retiring in the grade of Under Secretary,

and that I also served as aircrew in the RAF from 1941 to 1946.
