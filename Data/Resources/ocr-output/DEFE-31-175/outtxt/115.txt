Close encounters of an alien kind

BODIES of four "aliens from a
crashed UFO (unidentified flying
object) were recovered and exam-
ined by a special American
Government team 40 years ago,
according to a top-secret * docu-
ment' obtained by a British
researcher. I

A bitter debate is now likely to
develop among UFO experts over the
existence of a mysterious committee,
code-named Majestic-12, which is
supposed to have examined. the
aliens.

The highly classified briefing paper
claims that the then head of the CIA,
Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoctter, repor«
ted that ' although these creatures are
human-like in appearance, the biolo-
gical and evolutionary procestes
respofsible for their development
have apparently been quite different
from those observed or postulated in
homo sapiens." -

The document, which has been
shown to The Observer by Timothy
Good, Britain's leading UFO
researcher, purports to be a briefing
pape for President-elect Risenhower
on - Operation _ Majestic-12, - also
known as MJ-12.

In his book, *Above Top Secret:
The Worldwide UFO Cover-up," to
be published by Sidgwick & Jackson
on 9 July, Mr Good claims that MJ-12
was a committee of senior US officials
which investigated and then covered

up news of Dying saucer crashes.

Other UFO experts. believe. the
story could be a hoax involving the
planting of 2 fake supporting White
House memo in the files of Air Force
Intelligence and then getting. the
National Archives officially . to
declassify a forged document.

The Eiscahower briefing papery
dated 18 November, 1952, claims the
MJ-12 committee had been set up by
his predecessor, President Truman,
on 24 September, 1947, as a 'top
secret research and development]
intelligence operation . responsible
directly and only to the President of
the United States."

The document reports that on 24
June 1947, ' disc-shaped. aircraft?
were sighted in the United States.

'Little was leaned, about the
objects until a local rancher reported
that one had crashed in a remote
region of New Mexico, about 75 miles
north-west of Roswell Army Air Base
{now Walker Field). o

* On 7 July 1947, a secret operation
was begun to assure recovery of the
wreckage of this object for scientific
study. During the course of this
operation, aerial reconnalssance dis-
covered that four small homan-like
beings had apparently ejected from
the craft at some point before it
exploded. These had fallen to earth
about two miles east of the wreckage
site,"

According to the briefing paper:
*All four woe dead at badly
decomposed to action by preda-
tors and exposure to the elements
during the approximately one week of
time which had elapsed before their

 

* A covert analytical effort resulted
in a prefiminury consensus: (19
September 1947) that the dise was
most likely a short-range recon-
nalssance craft .. .

The Majestic-12 Group remains of
the unanimous opinion that imposi-
tion of the strictest security
precautions should continue without
interruption .. into . the - new
Administration."

Inquiries by The Obterver at the
National ives, the archives of
former Presidents Truman and
Eisenhower, and the National Secu
ity Council archives, have been
mnsble to authenticate the briefing
paper. They all say that extensive
searches have failed to locate copies of
the document.

There is, however, new evidence

from the Giles of US Intelligence that -

a secret group called MJ-12 did exist.
This is a White House memorandum
to General Twining informing him
about an *MJ-12* briefing for
President Bisenhower. | It was
declassified on 12 January 1987.
