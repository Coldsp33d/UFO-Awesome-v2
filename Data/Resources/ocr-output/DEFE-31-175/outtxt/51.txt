Dear Six,

I am writing as a student at Sheffield University and area representative of the
Independant UFO Network, which investigates alleged sightings of "UFOs" in the north
of England, M

My reason for contacting you is to ask if your Ministry is avare of the numerous
sightings of an unidentified delta-volent shaped flying object, carrying a barrage
of brillient lights, over the towns of Derby and Uttoxeter on the nights of Sunday,
August I6th and Monday, August I7th, 1987 respectively, I bave personally interviewed
six witnesses who obtained very good views of this object, including a couple who came
within 100 feet of it when returning home to Derby on the night of August I6th,

I would like to ask if you can provide any suggestions or explanations as to what
was observed on the above nights, and whether there was any mili tary/RAP/NATO exercise
ox helicopter manoeuvres taking place in the above areas at the stated times, I realise
this information may be confidential, but I must stress that I have no wish to know
what may have been going: on that night, only if there were military aircraft in the
area at the time that the Ministry was aware of.

I would also like to ask if the Ministry has received any other reports relating
to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena reported during the month of August I987,&nd if so
whether details could be provided,

I am preparing a detailed dossier containing the relevant details of the cases I .
have investigated above (including a sighting in Barnsley in which the witness obtained
photographs of an unknown flying object which are are the moment being analysed by

* computer in the USA), and will provide a copy for your Ministry if you feel these
incidents are of defence interest,

I look forward to hearing from you in the near future (ETH enclosed),

MINISTRY OF DEFENLE ;
Sec.(AS)2

= 6 0CT 1987

  
   
   
 

Yours faithfully,
Section 40
