, Dear Sir,

I em compiling a full report on a sighting of two very large
Ufos,which were seen,by whet I estimate to have been hundreds of people,in
Plymouth slone. These Ufos made successive passes over the city between th e
hours of 10. 30pm and 2.00am on the evening. of the 4/5th of August.

These two objects bad been seen 30 flying at.
geeat height,over Zxeter in a NZ to SW direction. They were tracked on- radar
by Air Traffic.Control a t Zxeter ond by people in the town.

I know that in the past the authorities have refused to rel~
ease any information(with some notable exceptions)but this was such a signi-
ficant event,that I sincerely hope that you will be able to help me with
some details, if you would be so kind.

A featume of the incident thet I am finding hard to clarify,
is the height at which the objects were flying and their size.While f1ying
over Plymouth, the witnesses here(myself included)felt that they were at a h
height of something between 4 and a } a mile,amd apparently the size of a
Jumbos jet. However the two delta shaped objects were seen at the same time
in the Plymouth direction,from Sude on the north coast,a distance of LOmiles
away, The Bude sighting was by an RAF wartime navigator,who states that he
has never seen anything like them in all his years associated with planes
and flying.1 shoul @ think we can take the word of a wartime RAF man,eh?

So would it be possible for you to give ma any informs tion
regarding the height,size and speed with which you tracked these objects?
Were any aircruft sent up to investigate these Ufos? R
If not,what criteria do you use for deciding whether to invest-
igate unknown aircrart enéering our sir-space?

And following that what do you suggest I say to all these peo-
ple,who ask me what is the RAF doing about these things?

Believe me this was avery impressive "display"by a very impre-
esive unknown flying aircraft,of which three sets of photographs were taken
that I know of,and as I was writing this I have just had a phone call from
further slong the Devon coast of a lot of Ufo activity in the last two weeks,
Helicopters being seen the following day circling the srea,where Ufo was seen,
I dont know what you may know,but I kave a strong feeling that this Ufo act-
ivity will be increasing in the future. This bs after an 18 month lull in Ufo
activity over the Plymouth area. Any ideas on this?

I assure you that any information would be treated in the str-
ictest confidence,if requested,

' yours faithfully L soa
