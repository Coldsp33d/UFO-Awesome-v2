UNIDENTIFIED FLYING: OBJECTS~--~CORRESPONDING
WITH THE PUBLIC

Reference:
A. Conversation Section 40
of 24 Aug 87

 

 

 

 

You mentioned at reference A that you
occasionally receive correspondence from
members of the public asking for information on
possible UFO sightings and related topics. In
order to avoid duplication of work and to
provide a single focal point for the public we
agreed that all correspondence on UFOs should
be forwarded to us for answer. Would you now
please accept this as formal confirmation of
this proposal and arrange for all future
letters to be sent to Sec(AS). I would also be
grateful for any background information that
you may have to go with any correspondence that
you receive.
