Dear Section 40 "1 \ o : 4d

I wonder could you help me with some information? My colleagues and I at the British UFO
Research Association have recently been inundated with UFO reports from several different
parts of Britain but all on or around the same date.

The areas in question arei London,Derby,Burnley (Iancashire) and Batley in West Yorkshire.
London and Derby especially had a great number of UFO reports on Saturday. 15th of August
on Sunday 16th of August.What I would like to know is does your department have any UFO
, reports for these or any other areas on or around the above dates.I would also ask you
x to check to see if there was any military activity in these areas that might account
for the unusual observation,

Any assistance you can give over this natter would be greatly appreciated and a prompt
reply would not go amiss either.

'f 108k forward to you veply,untill then I am,

Yours Sincerely,
